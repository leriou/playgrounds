__label__0 Argry Birds is for free to play a games on your kindlefireBecause it for free. and to play right.

__label__1 I can't believe how  hard I try to hit the target and still can't make it, it's good to laugh at oneself and this game is good for that
__label__0 I didn't like it at all .I think it is more for kids. I am really not into many games
__label__0 I got to the end of he pre-installed version. Confused, I checked online to see that my app was missing an entire level. One post suggested downloading a newer version. It crashes moments after it starts.

__label__0 I love angry birds, I have no issue with ad supported games.  I have a real issue with an &#34;ad supported game&#34; that constantly launches full screen ads that last substantially longer than the level you just played.  The in game ads are fine, and w

__label__0 I see nothing wrong with this game but I busy don't think it's fun. Shoot a pig with a bird. That's alp you do.
__label__0 it isn't that great it gets too hard and is really frustrating.  I wouldn't get it again. I'm sad I spent the money that I did.
__label__0 it keeps telling me &quot;my payment method need a US credit card&quot; even though i already have! ! what can i do? i really want to play! ! HELPPP
__label__0 I tried to play this game, but I lost interest and have not tried to play it again.  I will try it again!
__label__0 It's OK but wasn't the type of game I could get into so I deleted it. Someone had told me to try it so that's why I downloaded it in the first place.
__label__0 I've played Angry Birds on my daughters tablet and had fun. When the Free version was introduced, I thought dealing with a few advertisements would not affect the enjoyment of the game. Boy, was I wrong! Within 5 minutes, I removed the app! Personally, I

__label__1 OMG THIS FARTS :3 WHAT I MEAN IS THAT ITS SO AWSOME!!!!!!!!! CAN U BELEVE I LOVE THE NEW UPDATE BEACUSE THEY ADDED POWER UPS I MOSTLY LOVE THE SLINGSHOT ONE IT MAKES IT GO FASTER
__label__0 The game is stupid and the graphics are primitive.  I want to remove it from my Kindle. I want more games like popping stars that involve cerebral activity.
__label__0 The game was fun at first. Then when you would play more and more because you like it. Then it would get hareder and therefor it would make the game very boring! And don't get Angry Birds Space. Its a wast of money. Everybody please take my advice. So An
__label__0 the update for the power up ain't working for me. uninstalled 3 times still doesn't get the update please fix
__label__0 This app is on of the worst if have ever used. Its levels are stressful as all of the birds seem to be morons and miss the target everytime. Also you can not ever shut down any apps made by this appmaker, they constantly run and kill your battery. DO NOT
__label__0 This app was OK but the paid version still has ads, just in different forms. What's worse, now that I've uninstalled it, Amazon won't remove it from my list, a constant reminder that I should never have downloaded this app.
__label__0 this game was hard to download.it would be easier if it was easier.but I love that the game was free.
__label__0 This is the stupidest game so far, not even my Grandkids like it, and to thik I paid money for it  ugh.
__label__0 though this would be fun but is boring gets old fast with , no challenge  can't see the what the whole buzz is about
__label__0 Too technical for me. I got so upset that I removed it from my unit in favor of games I like.
__label__0 Unless you are 7 years old , this is a very boring and hard to manuver application. The game is redundant
__label__0 Using birds to kill is just plain sickmy 3 year old loved it and started &#34;killing&#34; things in his play time
__label__0 We all love the beloved angry birds characters but this app gets really old I mean really old, its fun the first couple of times but everyone has shirts of it youtube videos of it,I mean really this has a terrible lasting appeal
__label__1 Who are these 20 godless inbred bafoons giving this game 1 star, that is probably the score of there I. Q.  Lol just kidding, but seriously this is a great game, very good pass time, and your kids will love it. If there is any good catapult castle games 
__label__0 why do these apps appear on my device if I DON'T CHOOSE THEM?stop doing this it's very ANNOYING, I'm ready to return my Kindle if this keeps up!!
__label__0 Wouldn't load on my Trio 4.3&#34; tablet.  I can't say I hate or like it.  Perhaps I'll try again later when I get my dream tablet, a 7&#34; Samsung Galaxy Tab 3.
__label__0 Angry birds is so boring all you do is knock down the pigs and then the birds are doing flops and stuff it's stupid.
__label__0 cant install on kindle fire files been corupted witch is bs i cant play my game this game needs to die.  i know bs rovio fix it if you can please.

__label__0 free game added to kindle over Christmas - has been deleted - alredy had it and was added again. thanks
__label__0 .I don't get why the birds angry.I don't get why everyone likes it. its not that fun of game.
__label__0 i dont like it.  it stinks. it takes so much to make the stupid pigs die. they dont die quick enough. and the birds NEVER go where i want the to go. it is so frustrating that sometimes i want to throw my kindle across the room.  you can do better rovio. 
__label__0 I don't like it so I say if you get it you are either so addicted you don't have a life or you got it for when there is almost nothing else to do or it is for a sinking or you are almost dead or you are dead oh ya also I just like posting random reviews
__label__0 I don't understand all the high reviews or the great love people have for this game. I'm glad I didn't waste my money on the 99 cent version because I wouldn't buy it at 5 cents. It doesn't take any thought or skill and hasn't any entertainment value, ne
__label__0 I don't under stand what the big deal is about this game my dad loves it and my brothers both like it but I don't under stand but whatever
__label__0 I don't understand why this game is as popular as it is. I found it silly and boring. what is all the hype about?

__label__0 I hate this app so much it stinks so I deleted it  all you do is shoot an ugly bird to kill pigs.  REALLY ROVIO???
__label__0 I thought this was going to be the best game ever but it was boring. The characters are really cute, but it's the same thing over and over again. Fling the bird, try to smash a pig. Maybe it's just a quirk, but it's so SLOW. It takes ten to fifteen secon
__label__0 It might seem fun at first but,after awhile it gets totally boring.I got ,my kindle for X-mas,and this was my first app.but,as I said.....it might seem fun at first.worst app ever.
__label__0 It's not the regular version, so I don't like it or use it.  Perhaps an Angry Bird afficionado will like it.
__label__0 It was ok for the first few rounds which presented a challenge, but id like to be able to win a couple rounds...?
__label__0 I used to love this game now its so boring its so 3 years ago I don't get why Ppl still have this game they gotta make this game more exciting not just u defeate

__label__0 Omb! I am in love with this game! NOT!!!! This game gets SOOOOOO BOOOORING after like the first two levels! WTF? This is really what everyone was &quot;so excited&quot; about? Well I don't know what they see in this game. Its so boring.
__label__0 The grandchildren like it and it keeps them busy during grocery shopping but I don't get what the big rage is all about.
__label__0 This app is just plain boring all you do is kill pigs(disappointed).What is the point of this app???DO NOT GET THIS APP!!!!!!
__label__0 this tame is soooooo boring. Even though it is free it is not a good buy.  :( all u do is fling birds @ buildings.

__label__1 Buy the ad free. Worth the pennies it costs. Love Angry Birds! Developers are geniuses. Fun, fun game to play alone or with someone else.
__label__1 Free and fun, what could be better?  I enjoy playing Angry Birds on PS3 so I had to have this app for my Kindle, it's a nice mini version.
__label__1 Free and fun, what could be better?  The birds are angry, it's everything I expected, and anyway, those pigs had it coming!
__label__1 gives me a chance to decompress in a silly way.  Love the complaining and cheering they do when each level is either won or lost.
__label__1 good and fun game, i purchased this game from amazon.com i dont have it on my phone so i just downloaded it to my kindle
__label__1 great app highly recommend very easy to use or navigate a must have for very kindle owner very fun to play
__label__1 I am addicted to this game. Lots of fun. Sometimes one needs a mindless game to play and relax from the normal everyday toils.
__label__1 if you don't know what this series of games is, then it won't do any good trying to explain it to you.  Find someone with a tablet / smartphone, or even a roku xs, and become addicted to solving the puzzles.
__label__1 I have never played Angry Birds. I uploaded this on my Kindle Fire and it is very fun to play on! Even though the levels get really hard but I totally reccomend this and its also free so your getting a good deal here. :)

__label__1 My grandson has this and I like to play on his Hook.  And when I got my Kindle I wanted it too so I will enjoy it. And it was free. Free makes a difference.
__label__1 Never had played this before but love it.  Would recommend this for anyone with some idle time looking for a good game.
__label__1 Purchased this for my Grand Kids and this game is really loved by them they beat me at every game.
__label__1 So much fun.it's makes me laugh when I hear the pigs making the noises...they smile at you though when you don't beat the level.like they are mocking you...lol
__label__1 The goal is to take the various birds who have various actions,  and stretch them back on their rubber band,  and aim it at the green pigs, and knock them out!!!
__label__1 the graphics, movements... everything overall is smooth. there isn't a glitch in sight. and ads? what ads!? for most of your game play you wont notice them, and when they do pop up every once in a while, they creep up unnoticed in a tiny space on the top
__label__1 This game is great the hole family play's it and we are not young people.My sister started it and then got me started and we are in our 80's my brother is in his 70's and guess what can't stop him so I would say it's quite A game.

__label__1 This was the first game app that I downloaded for my kindle fire and it is the app that I continuously go back to and play the most. Many free apps that I download usually get uninstalled very quickly....not angry birds! Great way to pass some time. The

__label__0 I do not care for this game I think it is a boring game and very very pointless :kindle fire
__label__0 Its hard to control. Adjusting my fingertip up and down on the screen seems to do nothing and it launches birds when it feels this is required, not when I do. Sometimes completely ignores my attempt to launch entirely.
__label__0 My husband downloaded this and I still don't see the point of this game.  Why is it so popular?  I mean my kids are playing it and they don't get what is going on.  Only that you get to fling birds at pigs?  WHY
__label__0 not good...games bad...not good ffor kids...they r throwing birds! really people...sue them dumb people! sue who made Angry birds. xhhshsjsjsnsn shshs
__label__0 Played once and then the app would not load because of the add. DELETED IT Would not load or run.
__label__0 this game has to many unbeatable. parts it absolutely ducks 1star eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeewwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww! !!!!!!!!!!!!how can you people waste yo stupid app space 4 dis
__label__0 This is probably one of the most popluar games I've ever played. And to be honest. The first time I played it I thought nothing of it.Just a game where you fling a thing at a thing. Sounds extremely dismissive and cynical but there it is.I sort of grew u
__label__1 Simple to learn but difficult to master is usually a great sign of game design.  Requires certain amount of thinking and not just finger gymnastics. Much easier to play on a larger screen.On a Dell Streak, need to remove the SD card before installing or 
__label__0 fun game till an ad blocks the screen or some stupid film ad livid you off the game and you lose a shot
__label__0 the game is very good. But if you install this over your other one with ads it will delete everything , all complete levels and unlocks.It deleted all my progress.
__label__0 This game sucks you do the same lame thing all over again and again. yeah&hellip; you get different birds with different powers&hellip; but its so boring. Most people can say 'it was fun for a minute's but&hellip; on this game&hellip; sadly&hellip; I can
__label__0 i dint understand why everyone is obsessed with this stupid game! it gets too hard and nobody will ever wanna play it. the red bird dosnt even do anything. bottom line.. this sucks dont waste your time dowloding this or the space on your device.
__label__0 it's quite boring. I don't get the hype about it. those stupid birds go exactly where I DON'T want them to go. I aim it all right and they just fail. I'm glad this is a free version I wouldn't buy it but some other people might somehow get some fun out o
__label__1 I'm not a big game player on my phone. I have a rockin PC with a 19&quot; monitor for game play. So, when I say Angry Birds is good, I really mean it. Fun, addicitive and challenging enough to keep the player interested... without making it impossible to
__label__1 Who doesn't likel the birds!  These guys are fun to watch and play. I love the various levels and designs created for the characters. Can't wait to see/play future games.
__label__1 If I need to waste ten minutes just waiting for someone this is a great game. It can get addicting.
__label__1 A game like this for free what a steal get it I promise you won't be disappointed robin is the best and never disappoint.
__label__1 easy to play and understand, characters are cute, the game is colorful, i like that you are able to do the level over and over until you pass
__label__1 Once you try it, it can be addictive.  And you definitely cannot beat the price.  I have to put it away, or I don't get my daily chores completed.
__label__1 It is the standard and original version of the game.  Many levels, lot of challenge.  Easy to play with no lag or issues with loading.  Works just like it should.
__label__1 I am very addicted to angry birds! This is a great app and work perfect on my kindle fire! Its free and that is a plus too!
__label__1 The one that started it all, Angry Birds ground breaking, LOL game. No tablet is complete without it. Get it, not because you want it or like it, but because every one and their dog has it.
__label__1 I love this game.It was worth the wait of downloading it. It would not let me get it til I registered a gift card/credit card.Every age can enjoy it.
__label__1 I downloaded this to my son's Nabi Jr, it's one of his favorite games.  He has all the angry birds free apps downloaded and can play them better than most adults at only 5 years old.
__label__1 Good for all ages! Tho it does definitely get harder the further you make it into the game. Very fun
__label__1 Well besides the fact I love angry birds it's fun and cool plus it's many levels for free. It's not disappointing
__label__1 Free Angry Birds... Just amazing, funny and with many different (and complicated) levels to spent your time. Just like every Angry Birds game.
__label__1 As with all the angry birds games, this one is fun and addictive. Free version is ad supported which can make it slower on older phones. . .
__label__1 Great game and helped me pass the time. Wish there were more levels but I can't complain for a free game.
__label__1 Angry birds. I like em. I get em. I play em. I get more when they come out. word word
__label__1 This was fun. It took a while to know certain things down. But I got eventually got my money's worth.
__label__1 Very addicting game for ages 3 and up. It was funny when my son first tried it, he sent the birds backwards, now, he is good at the challenges and plays to other levels. I was hesitant about the game and was glad I finally checked it out and discovered h
__label__1 It's fun and easy to do. Some levels are difficult but it is very addictive. One of the best games out there.
__label__1 This was a free app so i was shocked to see that all of the levels are included on this.  Lots of hours to play on this.
__label__1 This game has kept me entertained for WEEKS. I must admit, I was reluctant to jump on the 'Angry Birds' wagon, but I am ever so glad I did! This is a clever, if simple game (sometimes those are the best) and while they offer upgrades and unlocks if you p
__label__1 I love this game=] There's nothing I don't like about this game. I first tried Angry Birds on my mom's phone and I was immediately hooked.
__label__1 Thank u for making this app!! Its sooooooo addicting!! That's why I love it! &lt;3&rarr;&hearts;!! I reccomend this app to anyone that wants to waste time playing games&hellip; 5&#9733;'s
__label__1 Same addicting game that caused me to drain my phone battery so many times. The larger screen on the Kindle makes it a bit easier and that's why I got it.
__label__1 I ran down the battery on my daughter's phone, found three versions for my PC, and now have two games on my Fire.  They are all great fun, almost addictive, a great time-waster - but still great fun especially for a free game that last for hours and hour
__label__1 I choose a 5 star rating because my son enjoys playing angrybirds and he has not complained about how it works. would recommend to all.
__label__1 I love it! My kids love it. My wife hates it, but she's a Luddite so that doesn't count. Very addictive game.
__label__1 It has been such a long time since I downloaded this onto my kindle, I cannot remember if its the original or not?! Either way, its an angry birds game so you know its great!
__label__1 I think that my 5 year old loves this game the most of all of us in the family. She always says Bingo when she gets the high score in a level. I would recommend this game to one and all!!
__label__1 Love this game great stress reliever...Love the display on kindle fire. I play for hours and over time I try to better my scores by going back and replaying the levels.
__label__1 love to play this game on regular computer,  My eye sight is not good so can't play on phone but sure can play it on the computer.
__label__1 My two-year-old loves this game because they have a little videos at the end and she allowed to watch these little mini cartoons of Angry Birds and it's just fabulous so thank you
__label__1 Something very soothing about the music of angry Birds, it is wacky and funny but mostly addictive.  Why are they so angry? it is a fun game.
__label__1 Such an addictive game.  Me and my whole family love this game!  You play by yourself and try to clear the level.  Its fun to see how you stack up against your friends and family.  Sometimes we play where you get 2 tries to clear the board then you hand 
__label__1 This game is addictive. I quite playing it when the ads started popping up so much but the grand kids play it often.  They are ad immune I think.
__label__1 this is great for my childs kindle. it keeps her occupied and fills the time while we're travelling and at home
__label__1 What can be said about Angry Birds.  Its a game everyone loves, and its so addicting!!  Would recommend to anyone with kindle.
__label__1 it is so great to play on my fire! the bigger screne and everthing haha. dont pay 99&cent; just to remove a few adds. not even all the adds! they are just tiny little blips in the top corner. get it get it get it!
__label__1 The one that started it all!! Rovio has done a great job with this concept. Great time killer! Love it!
__label__1 This is a great game!  With it being a free game it does have some ads, however it is still a lot of fun to play on the Kindle Fire.
__label__0 Theyve added a bunch more adds very anoying. Mi got it when it fisrt came out and now its uber adds.
__label__1 who doesnt love this its addicting my wife wants a divorce over this game but im sticking with the birdies as an angry bird is better than an angry women great game
__label__1 More fun now that it's on the kindle!  Fun version, nothing like the original to have some good fun with birds!
__label__1 I love angry birds so addicting. I love it love it love it. It worth the download too fun love it
__label__1 We have enjoyed Angry Birds Free.  It has been a lot of fun for the whole family.  Easy to use!
__label__1 I love trying to beat this game. Kids can probably beat me at this. There is one I cannot beat. Hang'em high number 1. I haven't finished any of them, but I'll keep trying!
__label__1 A real challenge.  I think my dad for the knowledge of construction he passed on to me.  Very helpful in collapsing those structures just to get to a frog.  Who wouldn't enjoy that?
__label__1 My 4 year-old grandson absolutely loves it!  He plays it every time he visits me and it keeps him entertained!
__label__1 Most people think Angry Bird is just got the kids, try it you will love the challenge of getting to the next level. I find when I'm worried about something or I have to wait for an appointment it keeps my mind occupied.
__label__1 Measures your ability to project speed and location of the target, practice til you get it right, do not get angry, smile!
__label__1 This game has no problems on a Kindle Fire and has very few ads.. nothing to get upset about. After all, it is the free game with advertisements! Even so, this is a game for all ages. An amazing game no doubt!!!
__label__1 Addictive and challenging... I would recommend to anyone... Love it... Sometimes makes my brain hurt trying to figure out the strategy..
__label__1 This  Game  is highly  addicting ,  and  a  lot if fun.  The  only thin that I didn't like  so far is the annoying  screen that  asks the user to pay  for the game  while  you are playing. Right in the  middle of the game play, it just abruptly stops  du

__label__1 i love angry birds.  its an addicting and challenging game.  its much harder than i thought it would be but it gets you thinking along with having fun.
__label__0 The original game was the best game of all time,  even some of the sequels were good. Now the more recent games with the Power Ups have ruined it.. It's no longer worthy of best game... Should have left it alone.. It was a good thing,  was
__label__1 VERY INTERESTING TO ME AND GOOD FOR KIDS.  I LOVE THIS GAME JUST STARTED PLAYING IT, BUT IT IS MY FAVORITE GAME.  I LOVE THOSE BIRDS.
__label__1 grand kids play when on a trip well worth the down load thinks it is awesome would get more fast
__label__1 Angry Birds is fun to play and can be somewhat challenging.  This is a good sample of the games you can play.

__label__1 This is the rating from my 6 year old who has been doing Angry Birds for years now!It is fun for me too, when he lets me play!
__label__1 When I first got my Kindle Fire, I got several games for my grandkids to play -- this one is the only one they will ask to play.  It is also a hit with my hubby!
__label__1 Angry birds was the first non console or hand held game I have ever played. It was fun from the instant I played it. You just want to keep playing until you can get those snarky pigs! The gameplay is easy. You use your fingers to launch birds across the 
__label__1 good fun for whole family, keeps you on your toes trying to get to other levels , just an all around fun game to play.
__label__1 This game is so addicting! There are a few little issues, like the birds not doing what they are supposed  to do when I tap on the screen, but it happens rarely. Awesome game! Can't wait to get the next one :-)
__label__1 I just wanted a game for my Kindle. It is easy to learn and it can be played any where and at any time.

__label__1 Great little game for the kids and its free, i like to play it sometimes myself try it if you don't like it you haven't blown yor gaming budget
__label__1 I couldn't believe how this game drew me in.  I quickly played all the levels, but then started back through to achieve 3 stars on all levels.  some of them are proving to be a real challenge.  This uses up lots of time, but is hard to put down.
__label__1 my daughter gets these games, I think thier okay, but she loves them, whatever makes yr kids happy, so they will leave you alone for a little while is okay with me.
__label__1 My wife plays this game on her Kindle and really likes it.  She recommends it to anyone who plays computer games.
__label__1 I think everyone has played this by now.  Ad supported version, a little annoying but not a serious enough game to get in the way.
__label__1 Great way to pass the time.....very addictive and as a free app, I have fun trying to increase my score!
__label__1 This game is great fun and has its own culture with it.  I didn't get it at first but after playing it for a short time it is very addictive.  Next thing I know it is 1am and I have to shut it off to get some sleep.
__label__1 My 4 year old Grandson was having so much fun showing me how to play it on his mini IPad that I decided to see if I could get it on my Kindle Fire!  I found this, and he spent the night w/ me and I showed it to him, and he liked it better than the one he
__label__1 Who does not love this game! And it is free.. If you have never played angry birds then try this one and you will see what all the fuss is about!!
__label__1 Once I start playing this game,it is hard to stop. I get caught up it and forget about everything else.
__label__1 Angry Birds is one of the first apps we place on my whole families devices.  This is a #1 game at my house.
__label__1 I have angry birds on every device I own and I love to play it although I'm not really that great at the game although I still love to play it.
__label__1 It's Angry Birds. Probably the most famous phone/tablet game in existence. You're going to enjoy it so you might as well just download it.
__label__1 I am so addicted to this game. Even when I can't beat the level and have to use the eagle, I will go back and keep trying when I am waiting for the eagle to come up again, or get frustrated with the level I was on before...
__label__1 I am so glad angry bird are coming out with different themes like space and beach scenes. My son loves them all.
__label__1 I love this game but because it's free they are a lot of advertisements which come on between every level or so so it's a little annoying but not so much. Download it.
__label__1 Everyone love this game and its very addicted game ever! I cannot stop playing this game! Great graphic and everything!
__label__1 I like it but reds mighty feathers is lost by that I mean they added a horrible update its it was unique now it's like any other level

__label__0 Kind of boring - the novelty has worn off.  I've already  removed it from the tablet. All set with it.

__label__1 Wow, this is a ver funny and fun game.  I start to play and just can not put this away for the day.
__label__1 Fun game.  You can play for hours.  I like the sounds they make.  I love it when I accidently send the little fellows backwards!!!
__label__1 Like the game but kinda moved on to other apps. Maybe, return at a later date. Love the big black birds that blow everything up.
__label__1 Addictive game. Wish I would have came up the idea of Angry Birds. Wish they would update to add more levels.
__label__1 It's hard to say I love it when those miserable pigs keep smiling and blinking at me!  It's still fun.
__label__1 Nice game. I have never played Angry Birds before. So, when I purchased my tablet, one of the first games I downloaded was this. It can become very addictive in a very short amount of time. Nice way to waste some spare time.
__label__1 I love this game!!!  The graphics and music are fun.  It makes me smile.  It's no surprise that it's so popular

__label__1 Well I have never played Angry Birds, but my son sure loves it. If he's happy then so am I!
__label__1 This is an addicting game - lot's of fun.  I find the games quite challenging.  This is the firsttime I had played the game - grandkids play it all the time on their I-pods.
__label__1 We have Angry Birds on every tablet and phone we own. It's addicting and super fun to knock down those smug piggies!
__label__1 Ads are not annoying because they only pop up once in awhile unlike other games where they pop up after each round played.
__label__1 Easy to get hooked on this complete waste of time....but it is one of two of the most enjoyable games I play.
__label__1 I really like angry birds.  It is so cute.  This also is a great purchase.  All ages can enjoy this game.

__label__1 I started playing this game at 9:00 pm and couldn't stop until 2:00 am.  It's a fun challenge that kids and adults alike can enjoy.  Creativity at it's best!
__label__1 I'm hooked.  Drives me nuts but keeps you entertained and coming back for more.  I see why this is such a bif hit.
__label__1 Works well on kindle fire.  Would recommend.  Fun to play.  No lock ups.  Good graphics.  Nothing else to add to this.

__label__1 Great way to waste time. My 7 year old loves it and we compete for high scores! Great down load!
__label__1 It's just like playing angry birds on your phone but with a wider screen which makes it that much easier
__label__1 This app is great  fun and addicting. and is much more better on the tablet than on a small touch screen phone.
__label__1 The birds are back in this free version of the original that is keeping my kids happy and satisfied with the pecking action.  We haven't had any problems with running the game and while it doesn't have all the levels of the real game, it's still addictiv

__label__1 i do burn time on this one, but who can beat it for free.  and i've bought in to going back and trying to clear the levels at three stars.  grrr.  really don't have to with all the levels available.
__label__1 This is just a crazy game.  It is frustrating and fun all at the same time.  It is just crazy!
__label__1 My grandson downloaded this app so he could play it on a road trip.....but when I asked him to remove it, he said &#34;Grammy, you'd LOVE it, so I'll show you how to delete it if you want, but also am going to show you how to play it!&#34;.....and he did

__label__1 This is a must have application.I thought the game was stupid at first, but after playing it for a few !HOURS! I realized its flipping amazing.
__label__1 When you order a game online that you download you shouldn't have to write a review. After all its hit or miss isn't it?
__label__1 While it can be very frustrating it rapidly becomes very addictive. I have not been this addicted since the old days of crochet and space invaders
__label__1 Very interesting and excellent app. Hope have Angre Birds Space for free can be download for Kindle's user. Thanks a lot.
__label__1 This is a fun game to play occasionally (when stuck in traffic or in the waiting room). Some of the higher levels can be difficult!
__label__1 This was my first one and I couldn't get enough of it. I finished all the levels and didn't realize there were more verisions out here. Now I'm hooked.
__label__1 For kindle this is great but the internet holds you back from playing anywhere if there isn't internet , say in a doc office or  a hospital treatment room ( I get renegade treatment ) you can't play.
__label__1 You just want to keep on trying to beat this game over . And over! Good for both young and old , you will enjoy!
__label__1 Downloaded Angry Birds to my Kindle & definitely love playing it.  Highly recommend this game & even the kids & grandkids like to play it!

__label__1 There are no bad Angry Bird Applications.  There are no bad Angry Bird Applications.  Repeat after me as necessary - always fun.
__label__1 My 3 year old grandson loves this game.  And I love its diffrent levels.  I have to make him stop playing the games on my Kindle.  I don't want him to become a game junkey.  All kids need to play outside and pretend play.
__label__1 What more can I say.  It's addictive & I love it!  I needed to add 5 more words to submit this review.
__label__1 This is one of the best games for waiting at appointments, you can be interrupted by your Dr. appt. and know that the miserable little hero birds are still waiting for you. It is very addicting. The only thing is... it is not a good game to play right be
__label__1 I enjoy playing this game! I love the different levels! Some games are the same but this one is addicting!
__label__1 My son set me up on this and asked me to give it a shot. I found it a lot of fun and surprisingly entertaining. Who comes up with these games? Anyway thanks for the giggles.
__label__1 Just a very fun game and many levels. Terribly addicting but a challenge too. Other versions are just as fun and free
__label__1 I had never played or understood angry birds before I got my kindle fire and got the free app. I now am hooked! I don't find the few ads on it a problem at all and strongly recommend the free app over spending money just to be rid of the few ads that onl
__label__1 My 4 year old grandson is able to play this and it would entertain him for hours on end if I would let him.
__label__1 silly and lots of fun
__label__1 Driving you crazy, I dream of making those stupid pigs into bacon.Lots of great levels and annoying near misses to keep my comingback for more. Ugh. I love this game.

__label__1 I love angry birds.  One of my favourite games.  It takes skill and patience.  I recommend this game for anybody to play.
__label__1 I have become addict to Angry Birds and Love to achieve more awards and levels and kill those little pigs!
__label__1 This game was the reason for my purchase of the additional series that I currently have on my Nook. My grandson was especially intrigued by the game and actually taught me how to play it. While it may keep the kids free and quiet, it is not mindless in t
__label__1 of course the best.  We have it on the phones for the grandson.  He has been using the  game since 4 years old
__label__1 Love playing Angry Birds. LOVE throwing the little critters! Hate when the survivors laugh at me for not hitting them! =)
__label__1 Who doesn't like angry birds? It's free and after you finish each episode, the next challenge is to do them all perfectly. It's harder than you might think.
__label__1 It's fun and free, what's not to love about a fun and free app. I got this on the kids' tablets so they'd stop asking for my iphone.
__label__1 I definitely recommend this app. Angry birds is fun and entertaining for all ages. My father bought me a Kindle for Christmas and ended up playing Angry Birds for an hour that night! Always fun.
__label__1 Does this game &#34;really&#34; need a rating? The game is and has always been an exciting and fun game. There is only one thing that could possibly make Angry Birds better and that is to play life size(we've done that too).
__label__1 Original game so its a good game but the newer versions are amazing and more fun and interesting plus i like that you can hit more than pigs to get points
__label__1 Everyone loves playing this game. good for any age too. Even the little ones can do it. Good for car rides.
__label__1 I got hooked on this game and I love that it has many levels, so I don't get bored. Great App
__label__1 This is a fun game that has challenges, especially if you don't buy any power ups.  I have completed all levels and am now going back and trying to get all levels to highest score.. 3 stars or more.  It hasn't been easy.  this is a very time-consuming an
__label__1 I saw it when I first got my Kindle but did'nt get it cause I don't think I care much for games.  Visited the grandkids over Christmas. They had gotten a new Kindle Fire and introduced me the Angry Birds.  I'm having such a good time with it.  I'm so gla
__label__1 The game that started it all it is amazing it's fun and addicting+ if you didn't have this you wouldn't have the space game buy it now!
__label__1 I could play this game for hours on end. It's challenging enough to keep me trying! It's great for hand/eye coordination too.
__label__1 i like playing it and trying to bet my own score it keeps me going and going so whats not to like
__label__1 This is the normal version, but very fun to play. Kids love it, and it is also addictive if you play too much.
__label__0 This app is listed as free but it gives you a free sample of the game.  If you want the full game you need to purchase it.  This fine, but don't say it's free.
__label__0 I just can't play the game. everyone was having fun with it, but I just couldn't get the hang of it.
__label__1 I love to play angry birds.  I'm not a big game player but love Angry Birds.  It is easy and fun!!
__label__1 I am terrified of real birds, but Love the Angry Birds!  Sometimes, you just have to keep trying a level till you get it right!  Always go back for the 3 stars if you don't get them right away!
__label__1 My husband love this game but I do not have the patience for it. He plays this game more than he talks to me.
__label__1 Can' t stop playing!  Its nice to be able to . go back and play different levels over and over again.
__label__1 OMG!  I can't tear myself away from playing this game. Try as I might, I have a hard time helping those little birds take out the pigs! I can't seem to play just one game. If i don't score and score big, I redo the game over and over till I do. Then i ke
__label__1 I play this on FB almost everyday. You have to use strategy to figure out how to improve your score. Love mind games
__label__1 Great way to spend some down time and do something fun. Silly as it may be.... I really do enjoy it!
__label__1 I think angry birds is a great game. When I want to watch Tv I just let them play it then I sneak away.don't bother getting the one worth 99cents. I mean, they are just ads its not like they can destroy the world. it is fun yet challenging.it relaxes my 
__label__1 I cannot get it on my kindle which is where it was supposed to go, showed up on my daughter's Kindle and it's enjoyable.  Still trying to figure why unable to get on mine.
__label__1 it is a great gift, not educational unless you need to learn consequences (ha ha) my son and I love it. Free equals awesome, if it's really good!good ...awesome really fun awesomely great!
__label__1 The Grandkids play this.  I can't get anywhere in games that require any skill.  They like it...I'll stick with word games and cards.
__label__1 Amazing I never knew how fun this was til my grandson started playing now I play it all the time....fun
__label__1 they love it always wanting to play ,teachs them skills and they have killed each other when playing they actually share
__label__1 grandkids downloaded it so I havent tried it  as of yet but I will. when I do am sure that I will love it
__label__1 I can play this for hours.  It is a lot of fun.  I wasn't aware of what the birds could do though until someone showed me.
__label__1 It is a lot of fun the kids really enjoy this game they say it is a little different than the other games they play
__label__1 Great game...it amuses me for quite a long time and enjoy trying to get through all the boards.  Have gotten other angry birds games.
__label__1 I finally found out why everyone is playing Angry Birds.  It is a very fun and slightly addictive game.  I like the many different levels.
__label__1 Never thought I'd get addicted to this game. In fact, my 4 year is addicted to this game. It's fun and challenging at the same time.
__label__1 I love playing this game and still play it to this day. My only issue is that it is getting too difficult to pass.
__label__1 All I know is that my kids love these birds the kindle version is great and mobile love this and suggest for all families.
__label__0 1st I have to uninstall in order to get the new update. Now it crashes everytime I try to do any of the older levels. Rovio this is BS!!!!!!
__label__1 I decided to get this app to learn why everyone kept talking about it. It's simple - it's fun and a bit of a mind bender. Just challenging enough to keep you occupied while you laugh at the set-ups. Good time.
__label__1 Amazing game! if you've never played Angry Birds before, start here!Its the new Pacman for sure!Great for kids, teens, and the elderly!
__label__1 For those days you have to wait or try to keep your tongue this is the game.  I thought it was just for kids but no!!!  This is great and gets better and better the farther you go.  A must for folks that like to challenge their minds.
__label__1 Several levels. So it is fun for all of us. I can get lost for hours playing this one. Makes one think about angles and things to win. Now I know why all the kids are love Angry Birds.
__label__1 Had been hearing for ages and ages about Angry Birds and thought to give it a try with the free app for Kindle.  IMMEDIATELY sucked in, my oldest 2 daughters (7 and 4) like to play it as a treat when school work, chores, etc. are done for the afternoon. 
__label__1 Okay, this is by far the best you can get from a free game. This has about ten or more stages with about 30 levels on each,so we are talking about 300 or 400 levels - no joke! This game also comes with like 20 mini episodes ( also totally free) that you 
__label__1 This game is too much fun not to have.  I haven't had any problems with the App at all.  A challenging game for sure, but it is fun and funny. I had to go online to find out what each bird does but that was not an issue.
__label__1 Got this app for my new Kindle Fire HD.  Had the app previously on my android phone.  This is so much better. Graphics looks great.  Havent played much b/c my hubby is addicted. LOL
__label__1 The last level on the newest stage is so hard that it can very close to rage quit, bui still like the entire game.
__label__1 This is another game that I usually play on my phone and having it on my kindle fire is great.  It's a great game to fill waiting times in restaurants, airports, etc or during commercials at home.
__label__1 This game is addicting.  You just want those bird to get all of the pigs.  I could play this for hours.
__label__1 This game has no problems now you know theirs very very very very hoo  ads take me you will love it I this bored when I finished the game with all stars cause possibly angry birds is possible.
__label__1 So many birds! So many levels! It's a really great deal! If I were you I would have bought it! It's really cool! And I'm not just saying that because the birds are cool! I hope you enjoy it.
__label__1 Definitely addictive.  Once you get past the first couple of levels, it gets more challenging.  sometimes frustrating!  I think if yu are an engineer or studied physics, you would do well at this game!  Fun--especially passing the time waiting in the doc
__label__1 the younger kids like it alot
__label__1 It's so much fun, my husband and I  play it together.I don't care for the war games etc. but I love the simple little birds and piggies.
__label__1 Who doesnt love angry birds.... The game is fun and challenging.  Provides many levels which get harder and harder... So much fun it becomes addicting
__label__1 This is one of the few games I added to my Kindle. It took me a while to figure it out, then I couldn't put it down.  I am still learning about tricks of the game from fellow bird followers.
__label__1 This is a fun game to play.  Since it was an app, it downloaded quicly and was readily available for play.
__label__1 My two younger grandchildren and their cousins loved this game and play it all the time. I would recommend it .

__label__1 I have had many hours of fun playing this version of Angry Birds.  It has many levels and a lot of challenges
__label__1 The best game program ever made as far as I'm concerned, don't need a PHD from Harvard to play it.
__label__1 What can I say? We love Angry Birds. Prefer the apps with no ads of course. Not that expensive for hours of fun.
__label__1 This game is addicting, so much fun.  I love it and would recommend it to anyone.  Challenging with lots of levels
__label__1 Angry Birds - This is one of my favorite games. My grandson has this game on his cell phone and he thought I wasn't ever going to give his phone back. HA,HA, HA. This game can be quite addicting.

__label__1 Everybody in the house plays this game and as most people know, it's very addicting. No one wants to allow those green pigs to win ! LOL.
__label__1 I can&acute;t stop playing it but my sister loves mattybraps he is a good singer OMG how old is he like 8 or9
__label__1 Yah that's right who doesn't like Angry Birds. Plus it's free. This is a time consuming game in which the player is sucked into a battle VS the green piggie monsters. We the angry birds must destroy the pigs to retrieve are beautiful eggs. If we don't wh
__label__1 Got this as a Gift Item for my son on his Kindle Fire. He picked this out. Downloaded easy and works good.

__label__1 those pigs have to be eliminated!! we play this game over and over and over and over and over again.

__label__1 My daughter loves playing this game. She'll sit with her grandpa and both bond together while playing this game. Love that it brings them together.
__label__1 I keep this app on all my devices, for me and if my grand kids are here or I need to entertain a child while in doctors office etc.This game can keep any child entertained from 4 - 104.
__label__1 This game is such fun!!  It can keep you busy for hours if you want.  My grandchildren think its the best and you can't beat free!!!
__label__1 I love this game!!! Its so fun!  Night night night night night night night night night night night night n n n n n n NIGHT!!!!!!!! I love Spongebob &lt;3
__label__1 A fun game without having to put very much thought into it.  Who doesn't like Angry Birds?  It's a good game to just relax & play.
__label__1 Addictive!!  I really wish Amazon would not make you right an entire paragraph when providing feedback.  Sometimes just a few words can get the point across.
__label__1 who dosent love the birds it was free on my kindle I am a truck driver so when im sitting waiting to get unloaded I play with the kindle the birds are my fave.
__label__1 I love unlocking bonus levels. I also love graphics and cute puns. It's loads of fun and addictive in a good way. I beat all levels but have not got all stars :P:D 100% recommendationFavorite bird: bomb bird.
__label__1 So much fun, and so addicting. Yes, the craze got *too* big when Angry Birds showed up on pillows and socks and underwear, but this is still a great time killer when you want to smirk. If you're JUST getting into Angry Birds, start with this one.
__label__1 LOVE love love this game.  I am not a gamer at all but I find myself playing this game for hours and hours.
__label__1 this is the best game ever and it free plus it will last you  long time you have to try it its awesome
__label__1 Who doesn't love angry birds? This a great game to pass the time.  My kids love to play all the angry birds games
__label__1 I love this game. Easy to follow, very addicting. I can learn all sorts of ways to play with these birds and is alot of fun.
__label__1 This is too much fun.  The graphics are great and the skill level is easy to difficult.  One of my favorite games.
__label__1 Once you start playing, you can't stop.  You have to keep going until you win.  Can also be frustrating at times.
__label__1 I considered purchasing the paid version of this app but decided to try the free version first,I honestly have had no problems with the adds and really think it's just as good as the paid version!
__label__1 This game is great and perfect for all ages. There are ads that pop up during the game but you can choose to get rid of them. I recommendthis game to anyone.
__label__1 this game has great graphics and is easy to control it is in my opinion the best free game on the app store
__label__1 A great way to pass time. Very fun,the sounds the birds make when they hit the grown,is so funny. I thought it would be a childish game,but I was wrong,I love playing it.
__label__1 This again is for my grandkids.  They asked me to put it on for them.  They love it.  It's fun.
__label__1 We love all the angry birds games and this is no different. It is so much fun to play and my five-year-old can't get enough of this one.
__label__1 Always liked Angry Birds and I never tire of it. it Now I do t have to squint to at on my. iPod anymore with my Kindle Fire'
__label__1 Sometimes I'm sorry that I ever started Angry Birds...just because  I cannot get to the next level...I really love it
__label__1 Angry Birds Free is a great and fun game to play for the kindle fire. It's a really fun game to play.
__label__1 If you compare this to Ad-Free this would be 9stars I guess. So get the ad free version. Best game ever on phone or handheld device. Challenging and fun for all. Not a gamer, try it anyway. It is too fun. It's FREE.
__label__1 As always Rovio comes through again.Great game.Keeping it up Rovio.One never know what those Bird's are up to.
__label__0 Never got the rules or any idea how to play it,so just deleted it from my device.  It seemed stupid to me.
__label__1 I'm afraid my husband may sue the makers for alienation of affection.  Once you start playing Angry Birds it becomes almost impossible to stop.  It is perfect for all ages, easy to learn, almost impossible to master.
__label__1 This is a frustrating game I can't put down because I hate to lose! I find I want to do just one level but wind up doing more because it challenges me so much.
__label__1 I am sure I am not telling anyone things new... Gotta love this game. Even the free version is well worth your time.
__label__1 this game is really great. never get tired of playing it my four year old grandson is a whiz at this game
__label__1 How can you possible berate what has become a classic cult-like game?  You can't, and getting it free is a bonus.
__label__1 Lots of fun for all ages.  It is easy enough for my young grandkids, yet my elderly parents love it too.
__label__1 This is another game that will keep a child entertained for hours if you let them.  especially good for waiting rooms .
__label__1 I have been playing this since it came out for the oops touch and now I cant stop playing it
__label__1 Downloaded on my tablet, comes in handy while waiting on appointments and etc. Also have it on my phone as well.
__label__1 The kids I know are glued to the computer/smart phone/kindle already.. Nothing wrong with having a good time and wasting away some hours learning trajectory and spatial relationships.
__label__1 angry birds is fun any time especially the orginal my favorite though i enjoy the others new ones but i love the orginal
__label__1 I love this game. The sound is great.  I don't get to play it often enough but when I do I enjoy it.

__label__1 My son, husband, and I immediately became hooked on this game. It is a lot of fun to play. You might lose a few hours of your life playing the game because once you play it, I think it's a little hard to stop!It's easy to play--my son is 5 and he is able
__label__1 Very colorful little game have enjoyed playing it with our grandchildren, they know just what to do and how the game works glad I got it !
__label__1 This game is so addictive!! The free version does have lots of pop-up ads, but some of them are actually good ads that I am interested in, so they don't bother me, especially because I'm used to it.  Tons of levels and I like the different birds and thei
__label__1 This game is great for all ages. It is sad but I know older people that are hooked on this game and plays all the time..lol I don't play as much as I used to, but I really do enjoy this game. It is GREAT!!
__label__1 Enjoy all the angry bird games except Tiny Bird.  Keep coming up with new editions so I won't get bored

__label__1 I admit it, I'm addicted.  This is such a fun app, and free with the Kindle HD!  It works like a charm.
__label__1 I heard about it, wasn't sure it was for me...and then, it was for me.  Hours of playing and trying to beat the levels was a ton of fun!!
__label__1 Today I got angry birds hd and I thought it would be the same as this angry birds just in hd. But sure was I fooled! I actually got unlimtid mighty eagles (for one 1$) and much better graphics.I found it funner to play in the hd version than the original
__label__1 I could play this all day.  I love the challenge of the game and the different levels.  I would recomend this.
__label__1 The grandkids have played Angry Birds for quite a while now, so I thought I'd see what the fun was all about when I got my Kindle Fire this year.  I love the challenge!
__label__1 I play every day, trying to get three stars on all games.  i have done pretty well so far. will keep trying until i get them all.

__label__1 Two grandchildren,daughter and son in law all loveAngry Birds.  I do not play the game myself.  Four more words of filler.
__label__1 This is a fun game for all ages.  Different scenes and progressing levels make it challenging also.I can see why it is so popular.
__label__1 my son totally loves this game but i do have restrictions for him on the time since he could play it all day long if he could!
__label__1 If you played the other Angry Birds( space, star wars, HD,  seasons, seasons HD, seasons free, and Rio) you know you like them.  But here is something, something not the same. The basic one. The first. The one some people remove from their Kindle. Get it
__label__1 Again, my grand daughter plays this on my Kindle when she is at my house.  She loves playing the games
__label__1 Hahaha, lookie here. It's Angry Birds! Free but fun this game has it all. Those crazy birds and those mischievous pigs. The golden eggs, the sound FX, and more angry birds. IDK why I'm reviewing this now and not 2 years ago, I guess I'm 2 busy playing th

__label__1 I really like the power ups! Also, this update doesn't seem to have as many ads. Essential to any smartphone or tablet!
__label__1 I am truly surprised to have gotten this much entertainment for free.  the adds were placed in such a manner that they were not at all disruptive.
__label__1 People who play angry birds the original game is 100% free the update gives us reds mightey feathers the rest of surf and turf bad piggies for the free version greatest update ever:)
__label__1 Heard about this and when I got my Kindle for Christmas, I downloaded the free game. Became obsessed with everything &#34;Angry&#34;. - Got Seasons game and working towards the Star Wars version etc.  Like the do-over feature and the various levels and d

__label__1 This is a GREAT free app that can provide hours of entertainment.  The amazing thing is that they keep providing updates that adds more and more levels to the original game.If you do not want to be bothered by the ads, just turn off your wireless connect
__label__1 App works fine and of course fun. All levels work fine except for one which says it coming soon. Plenty to do in the mean time.
__label__1 I heard about this game when it first came out and then I played it. Another family fav. Its great for when you are waiting on something, instead of just sitting in a daz.

__label__1 Fun game!! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !  ! ! ! ! ! !This is nutts!!C

__label__1 this app is fun for all ages, from my kids to my husband, they all find it fun to play.
__label__0 You should get tired of this after a few sets.  I played it until the widget to get to the next level started winking out faster than I could get to it.  That's just not fair, and I hate a rigged game.  If that's what you really want, there's always Las

__label__1 This game is loads of fun and very frustrating at the same time if you are trying to get all 3 stars on each level. I have finally completed every level with 3 stars and completed all 22 golden egg levels. I have version 1.5.3. I installed the updated ve

__label__1 My grandson really enjoyed playing this game. He figured out right away how to play. He's only five and of course I was VERY impressed. I started playing a few days later and it really is fun. Have to watch the desire to play when I should be doing somet

__label__1 This was the first Angry Birds which I ever learned, I learned it on my friends Kindle before I even got my own Kindle Fire from Santa for Christmas this past Christmas 2012!  It is a fun game!
__label__1 I learned about it from a friend who also has a Kindle Fire.  It is so addicting, I love the challenges.
__label__1 Glad to have these so the girls don't want to play on the Iphone.  It's just like the one on the phone so they love it.
__label__0 So far as I'm concerned, another FLOP.  I know many people like this, but I really don't.I hope I can avoid these kinds of traps in the future.
__label__1 We enjoy playing this as a family.  Each takes a turn trying to get just the right angle to advance to the next level first. great on a long trip.
__label__1 This game is also a lot of fun,on my Kindle fire HDI can see the cute expression on there little faces when they crash...lol
__label__1 I love this app.it is the best one ever I really think that most people should get it.it has very few ads,it is very amusing.I say you should get it!!!
__label__1 FUN FUN FUN FUN FUN! KEEPS YOU BUSY BUSY BUSY! AND IT'S HILARIOUS TO... THOSE DARN PIGS AND THE SOUNDS THEY MAKE... OMG! DEFINITELY A WINNER IN MY BOOK AND MORE THAN A 5 STAR RATING SHOULD APPLY TO THIS. DON'T DOWNLOAD ANYTHING BEFORE DOWNLOADING THIS AP
__label__1 I downloaded this right after Christmas and have a hard time putting down, it's so addictive! My daughter has all of the Angry birds games on both the pc and my laptop, but she's not allowed to play on my Kindle. Why does this game draw me in so much? Th
__label__1 Initially got it to keep my granddaughters entertained but have found myself sitting on the sofa at night playing for hours!
__label__1 Ok come on now, who does not love Angry Birds.  Ive been stuck on a few of them for awhile but eventually break through
__label__1 Fun. You don't need internet to play. What you do is launch birds at pigs and u unlock levels.I think u should get this if your reading this review.
__label__1 me and my boyfriend play this all the time. we love it. great app and great on the kindle screen since its bigger that a cell.
__label__1 I really had a great time playing Angry Birds Free.  It was easy to download on my Kindle and I would recommend it.

__label__1 very good app. some worlds are really easy like the first one. others are harder and I really like challenges. get this app.
__label__1 I'm a soon to be grandma...YEAH!...far from a pro gamer.  What's not to love? Even have my hubby playing this and he hates computers/tablets, etc. yet there he sits in his favorite chair w/Angry Birds! Thanks! Not much is free anymore.
__label__1 I tried playing this game but I have to get more involved with it. But now that the holidays are over I can start playing it again.
__label__1 So much fun! I play it with everyone I know and recommend it a lot. The only issue is it sometimes freezes and/or makes me force close.
__label__0 I downloaded free angry birds for my kindle fire and all I noticed was full screen ads and when my little bro played it he said that it sucked so Michael, the piggies cheated, and that it was to hard to play. My little brother used harsh words and got TH
__label__1 Okay, so I'm the last person around to play Angry Birds.  But I'm hooked.  The freebie has a ton of ads so I will likely upgrade.  I'm glad the freebie was available to try out.  This game is hilarious and addictive.
__label__1 lots of fun, easy to play, except @ times, when you understand the meaning &#34; angry birds &#34; They can make you  ANGRY !!!
__label__1 He loves anything that has to do with Angry Birds. Sure has helped me when I need to keep him occupied.
__label__1 So once again everyone I know is playing the new levels on their devices except me. Why does amazon take so long to put the updates out? I have been checking for the update everyday since the new level was released and still nothing.
__label__1 She played this game on my son's cell phone and really likes playing it on her Kindle. She is 9 years old and my husband likes it as well.
__label__1 have had a lot of fun with this game. Loaded easyUse up the battery quick but is a lot of fun

__label__1 Grandson loves this app.  He plays all the angry bird apps. Commercials aren't too overwhelming.  Good action for my grandson
__label__1 I had heard alot about the game Angry Birds, but I did not know anything about the game.  I think it is funny, frustrating at times, very entertaining.
__label__1 My wife got a Kindle and plays all the time more than reading her books. Shes better than I am
__label__0 I had heard about this game and tried to see if I liked it. But what I found was the puzzles are too hard and I wasted a ridiculous amount of time attempting to solve them. I deleted the game from my tablet.
__label__1 I Can't. Believe. That. Everyone. Is Talking About Ads. I haven't. seen any.  ads this is crazy and I don't see Dr appetite whatever Talking. to me. . This is crazy and Pyscho 1. People Are Talking. About ads 2. Its CrazyBut. Awesome. App Go Team Rovio! 
__label__1 Very addictive. I find myself playing it until the battery goes dead. Really fun for all ages, my five year loves it as much as me.
__label__1 This is the ultimate craze that swept the nation. It is a great free game that I do believe that everyone who is able to has played this game at one point or another
__label__1 Great game, loads of fun, even better on the Fire than on a smart phone, larger and easier to see while you take out evil pigs!
__label__1 This game hooked me on Angry Birds. After this I had to go out and get even more angry birds.:)
__label__1 Despite becoming a pop culture Icon...this game goes down as one of the all time greets like Pac Man or Mario. Brothers. it holds up and continues to feel fresh no matter how many times you play. And who doesn't. try to get three stars on every level?
__label__1 Kids love it. Entertainable will help pass some time in an enjoyable fashion. A great game that is free is always nice.
__label__1 I use to play this everyday, and I don't play a lot of games, but this game is highly addictive and fun.
__label__1 Free app that my grandson had to have.  I do not have and interest in it, but he stays entertained for long periods of time.
__label__1 It is fun.  so many levels, it keeps on going.  I laugh each time I play itIt was recommended to me....and I would also recommend it.
__label__1 It is great to download this game for free. I wish that I could get off the first level though. For some reason this level seems impossible.
__label__1 I love it the graghics are really good and I am very picky about my games I don't really have many games so I just love it
__label__1 I appsoluty adore this app. It is so much fun. I strongly encourage it. It is like making your own bacon or sausage. Luv it. :-)
__label__1 I love Angry Birds!  It is a challenge as well as addictive!  I've had it and my kindle since Christmas and it has given me hundreds of hours of pleasure!
__label__1 My 10 yr. old grandson got me started on this one.  Hardly play it until I know he is coming and I have to practice up because I know he will want to challenge me.  Great little game.  R. Hobbs
__label__1 I can't get enough Angry BIRDS!
__label__1 This game may be the funest game that I have ever played!Angry birds is the kind of game that you will not ever get bord with. It is also game that you can play whenever you have nothing to do. Angry birds can be for all ages but the levels may be too ha
__label__1 I found that all ages will enjoy this game. My grand kids to me we all enjoy all the angry bird games
__label__1 trying to go back and get best scores on all of the boards.  is there anywhere to find what the most you can score is
__label__1 Always trying to get a higher score because the options are limitless. Could play this game all day! Very enjoyable.
__label__1 best game ever. you have to love this skill construction, destruction game. catapulting birds at buildings to crush them. hilarious.
__label__1 Great App!! I Love The Angry Birds!!  I Highly Recommend This App!! It is Great Fun and Highly Entertaining!! Love It!!
__label__1 its an overall great game, I just don't see any real good reason not to like the game. good fun, nice graphics, nice everything. I think Rovio did a great job on its most original game, plus it was the first I downloaded. Great job rovio.
__label__1 Angry birds is such a good game. Pretty common too. It is about some birds who got their eggs stolen by pigs so now they're out to get them. All of them. You shoot a certain number of angry birds from a slingshot and try to get all the pigs with the limi
__label__1 I think Angry Birds Free is great!  I play it both on my Kindle and online on Facebook too.  It is lots of fun!
__label__1 I love it so much, and it is so great, my mother is addicted to it!  You should make angry birds mario, but it is AWESOME!!! 5/5! Well, really 240000/5!
__label__1 Would recommend this to others. Good for all ages and whole family likes this game. Can't wait to play other games.
__label__1 what is it with these dang birds! I like this a lot...wierd game but interesting. I just can't stop trying to get to the next level!
__label__1 I like to play this when I am trying to relax...it is fun trying to figure out the puzzles! This helps me calm down!
__label__1 it is so fun but need new birds and new levels to play on and hf h g gvhvhbu. n b j h.
__label__0 worst game ever. would not open. tried getting it 7 times.......wouldn't do a thing. good advice.......DONT GET THIS APP!!!!!!! I WARNED U!!!!!!!!!
__label__0 this game is the worst game ever if you get this game you will regreat. if you like it your stupid or a dombo
__label__0 I love the full game but this is too short. First it deleted my file. Then while I was in the second level I was getting pounded and then finally I found what I needed then the game quit and said "the free trial is over if you liked it please get the ful
__label__1 Got so engrossed in the game that I forgot it was demo!  Will have to purchase because I want to get further!Majesty was great on my PC, and this app fits the bill also!
__label__0 Installs but when run will send you to the webpage to buy the pay version. Then it just crashes when you try to run it again.Amazon should remove this free version and perhaps even the pay version.This is not good.
__label__0 this was a real fail! its almost impossible to win and its really difficult to use!!! I don't even understand why I got it. it was immediately uninstalled.
__label__0 won't even let me open it. its up for like 3 seconds and then closes. I want out. I don't even know how to uninstall this. I'm not very happy at all.
__label__1 I love it at first its a little hard until u know what u r doing but once u r hood and know what u r doing its great
__label__0 I could not play this it was too boring and confusing I'm going to delete it of my kindle right after this, I wouldn't recommend getting this app
__label__1 If youlook at teh other reviews you will notice people like this game when it works.  It's free so you might as well give it a shot.
__label__1 Great game unless you are stupid enough to download an app that doesnt work on your device, hence all the 1 star reviews.
__label__1 Majesty is a very fun and adicting game.  i tried the trial version first and then bought the full game.  Trial version allows you to play several locations to give a taste of the game.  Purchasing the game opens up more content. i hope the devs will be 
__label__0 First off the controls for this app are stupid because you can't control the heroes that you hire. they just walk where ever they want to go and the graphics are terrible. got this for my kindle fire and it wasn't even worth downloading for 5 minutes. wo
__label__0 I do not like this one I liked the one on my old Kindle better it was bore fun and challenging to play
__label__0 Got it and was not pleased. Had to delete it. Thought it would be better but fell short. I am sure I will find one that measures up at another time. Sorry this wasn't it.
__label__1 I allways like to play Black Jack,Even when I went to Las Vagus. But found this game to be A Good Teacher so when I go to Vagus Agin I will know A little more About the Game to win this time.
__label__1 this is the most amazing alarm i have ever even heard of!!!!!!! it is so easy to work, has the best alarm options, i could go on and on and on!! LOVE THIS APP!!!!!!
__label__1 This app is so good & easy to use I actually purchased the full version (& I don't purchase many Apps because I don't mind the advertisements). It is a must have App.  I use the clock, quick alarm & have many recurring alarms set.  You can silence your p
__label__0 I set this alarm twice and it never went off...I'm not really sure why. Maybe I will try again at a later time but this didn't work at all for me on the Fire HD.
__label__1 i owned this app for probably three months. i've never had a problem i couldn't solve. the customizability is endless, i especially love being able to wake up to a different song in music library everyday. great stuff!
__label__1 I got this app as the free app of the day a while ago, I liked it so much I went over to the android market and paid for it!  I use this every morning and enjoy awakening to the nature sounds.
__label__1 This alarm clock is fantastic. I haven't got the full version but when I do I look forward to it. I have this app for my kindle fire and it works great. It has features that allow you to pick what song or melody to wake up to, do math problems before you
__label__1 Best alarm I have found.So many settings!  It is overwhelming at first, but once you get it dialed in, it is amazing.I have mine start 5 mins before I want to wake up, it begins with tiny trickles of water and slowly gets louder over the 5 mins (the scre
__label__1 I love the app....if only you could buy regular mode for less. sometimes I need an alarm Wednesday but you can always have more than 1 app...the regular version is better
__label__0 Repeatedly crashes on my Kindle Fire after asking if I want to install an add on. Maybe next version will be more compatible as this appears to be just what I want for sn alarm clock app.
__label__1 Amazing alarm. There is something about it ringing gently minutes before the main loud alarm that makes you feel refreshed. I have not had a headache or felt groggy since I started using this alarm.
__label__1 yes its Bejeweled but with enough of a twist to keep it interesting. runs perfectly on both my Samsung galexy prevail and my Acer iconia tab A500 with nice HD graphics on the tablet.
__label__1 This one is fun and after each match 3 or more puzzle you get to buy pieces that help you in the puzzle. You don't spend any real money except for the cost of the game.
__label__1 If you like matching games, this one is well worth the money. Very polished graphics and gameplay, nothing like the tons of laggy, buggy free match games onthe market. Enough to keep my attention and want to keep playing.
__label__1 I love this game! it plays just fine on my Acer a500 tablet. I played several levels and it ran smooth with no glitches. I will be playing this a lot. Thanks Amazon!
__label__1 Well done matching game that has great graphics on both my DroidX phone and Toshiba Thrive tablet.  I was given the choice to upload scores or not, as I wished.  The app can be moved to the sd card, too, which is something I like in an app.
__label__1 This is a jewel matching game.  Nice graphics and sound effects.  Satisfying game play. For those who have the Pandigital Novel, it works great on the 7" screen. Also works great on my  Android phone.
__label__1 I hesitated to download this because of the review of a tablet. I took a chance and it runs great on my rooted flashback 7.1, honeycomb viewsonic gtab.  Runs great, good graphics, good game.
__label__1 This is a great &quot;bejewled&quot; type of game. The graphics are great and the combos keep things interesting. Unlike a lot of other match 3 games, the game feels like it is progressing and going somewhere, which I really liked. There are a bunch of l
__label__1 Works fine on my Dell Streak 7 tablet. I've always liked matching games and this one has a lot more to offer than just matching tiles. Very colorful and works very smooth. I highly recommend it. You can also transfer it to your SD card.
__label__1 I got this game as the FAOTD. I can't say that I would have paid $1.99 for it, maybe $.99. The game is fun and addictive, but once it starts going fast and you get in the groove, the game is over. Don't get me wrong, there are a lot of levels, but there 
__label__1 The graphics are great, and it runs really smooth on my HTC Incredible. Really fun and addictive! A must have game. Kudos to the dev.
__label__1 This game is a lot of fun and designed perfectly for touch screen gameplay. It has great graphics and music and lots of levels to keep you entertained. I definitely recommend it.
__label__1 it's a great free game. very fun. even if it's a bejeweled clone, it's a good one with new gameplay features.
__label__1 I really enjoy this game! I downloaded 2 and 3 because they are so much fun. Even my 8 yr old daughter has fun with these. I would recommend them to anyone who enjoys the match 3 games..
__label__1 I love this game, and its sequel, Treasures of Montezuma 3. They are kind of the elite of match-three games. The difficulty level increases appropriately as you get more skilled, and the bonus effects that help you increase your point-earning abilities a
__label__1 This is a great bejeweled clone, I started playing it and soon realized I just wasted a hour and a half playing this. A good mix in difficulty with enough variety to keep you playing.
__label__1 This game is really really fun and addictive. It has a ton of the stages. This not your basic match 3 game. Each stage has a goal and unlock new powerups the further you get. You have to get rid of a certain amount of special gems per stage and your on a
__label__1 This is a bejeweled clone with lots of added features thats sure to keep you occupied. It's a well thought out match 3 game with puzzles to boot. An achievement badge system. Well worth the $2 after the FAOTD.Fast paced game on the Optimus V
__label__0 Was able to play one game. Now application won't open on device. it is lost in cyberspace never never land.
__label__1 Great game to play when you're bored, waiting for the plane/train, in between TV shows, just before bed, or anytime, really!  The higher the level, the more difficult it is to get Montezuma to smile.  But you don't want to put it down until you do!!!
__label__1 Have spent hours playing this one on HTC EVO. One of the most fun games I have downloaded. It appears to now work on Kindle Fire as well.Watch out for May 2013 update! Looks like all it does is push advertisements to the game menu screen (where previousl
__label__1 I got totally addicted to this game and completed all levels.  Great way to pass the time.  Kids play it too.
__label__1 I don't play to many games on my cell but I love this game!! The biggest problem is that its too darn addictive, I can't put it down once I start!!!!
__label__0 Honestly this is a genre that we don't need to continue producing. It's lame. Doesn't anyone have any originality? Barf.
__label__1 Yes,  this is another jewel game!  BUT it is by far the best!!  Runs great on my droid2.  Thanks amazon! and much thanks to the developer!
__label__1 I've had this game on my phone for a year now.  Amazingly I still find it the most entertaining Android game I've owned.  I buy them, play a couple of times, get bored, delete them.  This one is a keeper.  Perfect for waiting around in Dr.'s offices or a
__label__1 Out of all the &quot;match 3&quot; games, this one is my favorite. It DOES work kn the Kindle Fire, contrary to someone else's review. It always has, and that's how I've played since I bought mine in December.The game has a ton of levels, and lots of pow
__label__1 I like the totems and bonuses. They make the game sort of unpredictable and ultimately more fun. I also like the puzzle mode. They took the gem game concept to another level with this app. Really great. Really fun.
__label__1 Works perfect on samsung galaxy.  Fun game, enough story to keep you interested, and nice clean graphics. 18 19 20
__label__1 Thought this would be another Bejeweled knockoff, but the added features are great. Was free app of the day months ago. Still enjoying it, and would buy it, if I ever needed to.
__label__1 I downloaded the free one at first, and I ended up downloading this one. It's always better to get the games you have to pay for, because the free ones, you end of having to pay in the long run anyway. I played one fast game on the free game, and I ended
__label__1 A fun game and long play time.  Worked well with Samsung Tab2.0, Pandigital Planet and would hang sometime with Pandigital Novel.
__label__1 I really like how this game involves unlocking features such as bomb tiles and special abuilities like getting two tripplets in a row of the same color can grant you some special bonus power.  Power ups clustered in a match three game works.
__label__1 I picked it up as the deal of the day from Amazon, so I couldn't go wrong.  I don't know that I would have paid for it, but for a free game, it holds entertainment value.  It is very similar to all the other gem type games out there, but it is VERY addic
__label__1 This is a wonderful game! Those who have compared it to Bejeweled are only correct in that you match the types to clear the board. But.... There is a LOT more to this game! You have to build buildings  with gold you earn by playing and earn tokens to hel
__label__1 I tried this game and I am glad I did. I was looking for Jewel Quest for my kindle, did not find the one I wanted, so I tried this game.It is another matching game, but the graphics are different. Tri it, I am pretty sure you will like it.
__label__0 was on third level in adventure mode and for soe unknown reason, progress lost, so started new file and quit after four screens. started game and no previous player data here.  registered a player name, but that didn't help either. uninstalled.
__label__1 I've played the predecessor of this game on the iPad. A lot! It is probably the game I've played the most. I played the trial on the iPad and had the get the entire version.For the most part, this is exactly like the first one, but the adventure mode is 
__label__1 Basically bejeweled Aztec style, that being said it's a fun game would def recommend. This is probably why it's been up for 2 days as AFAOTD.
__label__1 I told her about this game being the FAOTD yesterday.  5 hours later she still hadn't set her phone down.  That allowed me to watch Breaking Bad and Storm Chasers. (both are shows she doesn't like)Auto 5 stars!
__label__1 Extremely fast paced and alot of fun. This game will probably replace my chuzzle addiction. If you cant get into it, delete it. dont give it a bad review. This game os pretty much excellent.
__label__1 makes time fly fly away. couldn't believe the hours passed  by so far. would recommend to anyone who enjoys having fun.
__label__1 I have been playing this game non stop for weeks. A very addictive variant of the classic match 3 game style. Works great on the Toshiba Thrive tablet.
__label__1 Awesome sound, color and over all feel.  Easy to play, great time killer, overall a great bejewled type of game. A few extra factors separate it from bejewled like earning points to buy some needed items. You won't be disappointed as long as you like col
__label__1 love this game so far, been playing it off and on all day, and its free! makes the 'match 3' game more entertaining.
__label__1 help! help! little Timmy is stuck in the well! What do we care? he has not signed his will! maybe if we
__label__1 great job.  it's fun and has long and repeated playability. keep up the good work! love it a lot and play it often.
__label__1 This game is great. I spend hours of playing. So far,  I've collected all the statues to build the city. Now I just have to complete the levels. I'm looking forward to getting number 3.
__label__1 I find myself opening this app more often than just about any other game I have installed on my phone, and whenever I upgrade my phone, it's one of the first games to get reinstalled.There aren't any in app purchase requirements, a huge plus in my book! 
__label__1 I'm hooked on this game! The ability to get upgrades to the various blocks and idols keeps me wanting to keep playing. I've actually chose this game over playing my Xbox 360 a couple times.
__label__1 I loved this game on the computer when I played it a few years ago and its still a great game!
__label__1 I'm impressed by how well this works and runs on the Motorola Xoom (WiFi). It's addicting, and really attractive. A pleasure to play.Has become one of my favorite games in just a a day.
__label__1 This is just like so many games where you match three items... but it is a fun updated version with power ups and levels. Not exactly my type of game but it can keep you entertained for a while. Works well on my Motorola Atrix 4g.
__label__1 I never played the first one but I love this one.  It is challenging yet easy to learn.  I like the graphics and there are plenty of levels to keep you busy.  A great time killer and just plain fun.
__label__1 This game is fun and addictive. If you don't like this I don't think you could like ANY kind of app. Once again I LOVE THIS APP.:)
__label__1 This is a fun puzzle game, although it's very difficult to get top marks on the levels. The trick is to wait until you have some new enhancements (totems), and then go back to the older levels.
__label__1 i really like to read reviews before buying a game, no matter how much it costs and with Kindle Fire, it costs quite a bit less than the same game on computer version.First of all I really enjoy Match3 games and different graphics many times makes the di
__label__1 I don't like many matching games at all. In fact, I think they're mind numbingly boring. The ONLY other two that I liked were Super Puzzle Fighter II and to an extent, Dr Mario. Thank goodness for App of the Day, or else I wouldn't have found this little
__label__1 I played this on the PC and was pleased when I came across this for the android. Match 3 with lots of bells and whistles. Played a bunch of levels of the adventure mode and had no problems whatsoever with my Kindle Fire. Highly recommended if you like ma
__label__1 Hopefully solving video game puzzles is good for your brain, because this is another good entry.  I can spend hours playing.  Good graphics, sounds, and colors.  If you enjoy this kind of thing, give it a try.
__label__1 I have several match 3 type games and this is by far my favorite!  a few new spins makes it more interesting!
__label__1 This game is incredibly addictive. I play it every chance I get.  It is a very interesting and entertaining twist on Bejeweled and the graphics are fabulous.  Love it!
__label__1 New variation to an old idea makes it enjoyable. Nice graphics. It's the kind of game you can pick up and play when you really don't want to be stressing the grey matter. I play it for a break from work.
__label__1 EVO 4gWorks  extremely well so far. Great fun, no glitches or hangs. Easy to learn. Loads fast. Looks professional.
__label__1 If you like bejeweled, you'll love this game. If not, you'll complain about amazon giving us too many free bejeweled games.Either way, it's free, so no complaints.
__label__1 I know it is a good app when I can't stop playing it. it has more to it than just the jewel game.
__label__1 Finally some polish! This game is fun, beautiful, smooth, and substantial. Yes it's a  Bejeweled clone at heart, but that's not really a problem unless you didn't like Bejeweled. And this one has lots of fun extras. The professional design is so nice, as
__label__1 This is the best game out there on Android right now as far as gem swapping is concerned. I play it all the time. It has some features that separate it from other games of its type such as power ups from landing 2 or 3 of the same type of matches in a ro
__label__1 Got this when it was the free app but would definately be worth the $1.99.  I found this 3-in-a-row match game a lot better than others because you have a progress and can buy totems/upgrades plus you can compare your progressiom online vs other players.
__label__0 I have had this game on my Toshiba Thrive for well over a year and it is my favorite go to game. At least it was until it started requiring internet access to run. Now it won't open when I travel. This is a single player game, there is NO GOOD reason it 
__label__1 my wife and I pretty much played this days and nights. this is one of the best of its kind!
__label__1 Another great game for grown ups. Anyone who rates this game poorly is a kid. Excellent matching game for multitaskers. Well done!My only issue is that it ends, need more levels.
__label__1 very addictive, reminiscent of bejewelled play style.  has a gradually increasing difficulty level with unlockable special powers. graphics and interface are nice on the fire
__label__1 Love the look of this game and the music is ok too. Very addictive. Find that this is becoming one of my most played apps.
__label__1 This is a game of hours of fun and many challenges that I have enjoyed conquering.  I think you will enjoy it just as much as I do.
__label__1 Great game. Just cant put it down. i have it on my Droid, Asus tablet and my Kindel Fire. Very addicting.
__label__1 What seems like another boring old gemswap game is definitely something more. You have to swap the gems with inner gems to complete the round. You also have to collect coins to buy little trophies that will help you through the levels. I think the only r
__label__1 Totally love it!  Very challenging, awesome graphics and very much worth the purchase of the game.  Can't put down the game even though each level becomes more and more challenging. I wanted a game that was fun and problem solving thought.  I got it.  Ya
__label__1 I am a fan of this game. Challenges you to think ahead. Loads of fun. It's a good one to download, and hard to stop playing!!
__label__1 If you are the type of person who likes to race against the clock this is a game for you. Wonderful graphics and lots of levels. It's addicting for sure.
__label__1 Original review: Good graphics, sounds and music make this my favourite jewel-matching game.  The fact that various match-ups and combinations give bonuses and time credits is a plus, but the sparkling jewels and other "eggs" (like ones that blow up surr
__label__1 Really like it.  Runs very well and is addictive to play.  Nice professional looking graphics.  Like how you can get your game ranked.
__label__1 I play this game every night before bed. It takes my mind off of my worries and relaxes me so I can sleep like a baby!  I love this game!
__label__1 I am rating the game. Not Amazons choice for FAOTD or the fact that the developer chose to make a game of this type. There are channels for that. Amazon customer service and developer feedback. It is so immature and irresponsible to leave a low rating fo
__label__1 I am enjoying this game. I do really like the jewel type games and this one has a nice theme and is different than others I've played before. I am glad I downloaded it. it works well on HTC evo.
__label__1 This is a fun an addictive game in the style of Bejeweled. However it has its own unique touchs that completely separate it from bejeweled and will keep the game entertaining for hours. I've really come to respect Herocraft for creating quality apps whic
__label__1 This is a very fun game that looks like Bejeweled, but doesn't play like it. Plus, it has a great leveling system that also levels up the difficulty of the boards nicely.This is a "clear settings and start over" game for sure. I could play through it ove
__label__1 This is a very polished Match 3 game and well worth the download! Plenty of variety and reasons to keep playing!
__label__1 This game on PSN would retail for 15 bucks.  Same on XBox Live Arcade.  1200 MSP and all that.  You'd probably pay 20 bucks on Steam for this game.  The fact that this game only goes for a meager 2 bucks is almost sacrilege.  Simply put, this game is an

__label__0 Amazon ,get some real apps like modern combat 2 black pegasus,rayman,the settlers,ect....i love my galaxy tab but im still waiting for a better selection off apps ,not these trashy puzzles and word games.
__label__1 I got this app during the free promo yesterday, but it is definitely worth the normal price! definitely works better than a normal alarm and you feel better waking up with using the pre alarm feature.  love it!
__label__1 This app makes me wish I remove the stock alarm. Gentle Alarm has so many useful features, it makes me hate all others. I get things accomplished quickly with all of the intuitive settings, making the stock alarm worse than useless. Even if you don't nee

__label__1 Excellent alarm app, but why is Amazon so far behind on the updated version? Market is telling me there is an update but nothing on Amazon
__label__1 One of the few apps I bought for my G2 and I love it. Lots of options for alarms and the prealarm works like a charm.
__label__1 Worth every penny.  I've been using for a few weeks now, and it really works to wake you up refreshed and ready for the day.  How did I get along before hand?Only minor gripe (very minor) is the slide bars to edit volumes, etc. which are a little touchy 
__label__1 This apps wakes you up gently - and with the customizable profiles you can wake up just about any way you want to. Works perfectly on my Droid X. Highly recommended.
__label__1 Initially I had issues with this app, after a few mornings it would crash and recommend that I reinstall it. I must have done it a few times because I really like the concept. Well after a few updates with my system and I'm sure that Gentle Alarm went th
__label__1 This app actually makes you look forward to waking up to an alarm in the morning.Soothing and the sleep cycle thing is brilliant. great job dev!
__label__1 This app is powerful and easy to use. I use it as my primary alarm clock. I haven't quite gotten the pre-alarm to wake me up, but I probably don't go to bed early enough. On that front, the integration with the sleep bot sleep tracker is very nice.
__label__1 Great, life-changing app.  Love its customizability - fade-ins, captchas, decreasing snooze time, ability to set songs/ringtones, pre-alarms, etc.  If I paid for apps, this would be the first I'd spend money on.
__label__0 Bleh
__label__1 The concept of this alarm clock is very very simple.  It is also very very effective.  The pre-alarm feature makes this alarm clock what it is.  The basic alarm starts off at a low volume and amps up until you turn it off or after about an hour, which ev

__label__1 This is my alarm clock of choice and I have not even started to get into the advanced features.  It's snooze function is great for an alarm clock near the bed
__label__1 This app is great, use it everyday as my work alarm and it hasn't ever failed me.I love how you can set it to quietly play the songs then slowly it'll put the volume up, doesn't startle you with loud noises to wake you up.I've recommended this to all my 
__label__1 This app is simply the best! Customizable, easy to use. Highly recommend. One of my favorite apps, I use it every day. Glad it was free, but worth every penny if you purchase it.
__label__1 This is a great alarm app. It has several customization options, including being able to choose your own music as an alarm, quick alarms, and several profiles for each day. The user interface is nice as well. It is actually very pretty and easy to use. I
__label__1 Apps works as described and the gentle way of raising the alarm is so much better than the old way
__label__1 pre alarm, volume fade in, easy to skip next alarm, set by day of week, display brightness adjustment, turn phone over to snooze...really great custom features which allow you to set just about anything you want related to an alarm.  Highly recommend.
__label__1 I love the intuitive UI, love the night display mode, and I love the way it gently ramps up the volume at alarm time. It doesn't jar you awake, it's truly gentle.
__label__1 I am able to use very well on my kindle. At first i thought I had to leave it on all night but it will turn your kindle on for you when it goes off. I was able to put my own picture on the background and set multiple alarms through out the week.
__label__1 My fiance gets really irritated in the morning when my alarm goes off. I tried this alarm for the first time, this morning. I woke up while it was still super quiet, and it didn't wake him up and put him in a cranky mood! It is just awesome and so worth 
__label__1 Got it for free, but would have paid if I knew how well done it was. The dim night mode is nice. I like that it tells you duration till next alarm.
__label__1 I've had this app forever, and I've seen it progress from the beginning to where it is now. this is hands down the best alarm on the market. if you're a light sleeper, this app is a dream cum true.
__label__1 This appears to be a very nice app, with several features that my current (now past) alarm app is missing. As my alarm is one of my most-used apps, this will come in very handy.Edit: This is by far the best alarm app I have found for Android. I have trie

__label__1 This is an excellent alarm! I have used other alarms and this one is the most configurable. I like the way it slowly ramps up the volume to avoid a rude awakening. Others have complained about the permissions and they are fully explained when you look up
__label__1 This app has great features for someone trying to have something more than something just buzz at them or use the stock sounds to wake up.
__label__1 I.ve tried so many  alarm apps. Some looked great but didnt support playlists or vice versa. Some had some many setup functions you thought you were programming an alarm system more than alarm clock. This has the best of everything. Lots of features if y

__label__1 this is by far the best clock i've ever owned in my entire life. if a physical clock could what this clock does, i'd own it too. i've countless android clocks. this one works best in my opinion.

__label__1 The alarm clock that comes installed in most phones should be this one. Sound options, night modes, adjustable snooze. Perfect.
__label__1 Some mornings I don't need the extra motivation to get me out of bed, like when somebody is depending on me for something.  But when I try to get up for myself (like, to hit he gym) it is too easy for me to hit the alarm and think, "I'd rather have sleep

__label__1 The alarm clock rocks. It has all the features I have been looking for: deskclock mode, wake to mp3, random song selection based on genre, pre alarm to wake up ay the right point in the sleep cycle, and controllable fade in. This is a top notch app.
__label__1 You know I have found that the techniques that this app employs well. You can set alarm to start quiet and gradually get louder. Wakes you without startling you,  and I am impossible to wake.  Also you can set the dismiss to be a math problem,  what a pa
__label__1 I have been using this alarm for the last few days and it is awesome! I love the fact that I have not woken up groggy and that I am alert as soon as I wake up. Also, I have been much happier throughout the day as well.
__label__1 It does exactly what it says. I like the really gentle wake up as opposed to blaring alarm clock I used to have.
__label__0 Can you explain those permissions, please? Why do you need to read my phone id, and log files? No thanks! There are other options out there.
__label__1 I use this app every night. I cant believe it is free on amazon appatore today. Grab it while  you can!
__label__0 &quot;Error not logged in,&quot; when alarm goes off. I'm always logged in? so I have to wait 2 minutes to shut the alarm every time it goes off. Used to work well, now its total garbage.
__label__1 FYI: The creators of this app list the following permissions in the Android Market (I don't know why they're not listed on Amazon):PERMISSIONS: Gentle Alarm uses the following permissions...* RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED: So it can activate an alarm after you

__label__1 This is the most feature rich one I've used yet. Everything one needs. Love it. I've used a few, looking for that one that is perfect. This is that one!
__label__1 Simple, yet has tons of options, but the best is the ring/alarm starts out so quietly it almost sounds like it is coming from another room. No more jolting out of bed, because by the time the volume is louder I am ready to wake up. Love the widget, love 
__label__1 I've been using this app for months and love it.  Never have had a problem and its so much nicer waking up to the music gradually getting louder.  But this morning when I turned the alarm off I rcvd a msg that said if I do not upgrade in 30 days that my 
__label__1 It's pretty amazing how the pre-alarm works. However, there's an update in the Market, but not here? I'm seeing this more and more lately. What's up?
__label__1 has a lot of great qualities!!! I think it was VERY good app. Even the trial was great! The app worked great!!!
__label__0 Loved this alarm clock till it started forceclosing everyday. It works one time, then the next time you try to use it, it tells you to download it again from them Amazon app store.  Uninstall and reinstall and it works once and FC again. Vibrant tooted w
__label__1 Great app with many useful options. Use your own music, large display, love the large snooze and landscape options. Evo 4G

__label__1 I used to dread my alarm in the a.m. as I would awaken with a start and a thumping heart. No more, this clock is great and provides- just as the name says-a gentle awakening. Thanks!
__label__1 I&apos;ve tried a few different alarm apps, but I keep coming back to this one. It&apos;s smooth, low resources and has an available widget for faster access.
__label__1 Gentle alarm is truly the best alarm app on android. Who like being woken up with extremely loud sirens, or songs blaring. It definitely doesn't set the greatest tone for the remainder of the day. So starting off the day with a smile on my face, or at le
__label__1 So far great I love it. One ? Is there a way to take the icon off notifications or even move it by the time? I just dont like it where its at.
__label__1 Overall, it's THE BEST ALARM on Android or IOS!  There are just a few minor quibbles that I'll list later.  But, I've been using this for over a month and wanted to give the dev some props and credit for such a great app!
__label__1 Love how gently it wakes me up. No more being startled awake by an alarm. I love that I can set it for five days a week.
__label__1 I got this for free when Amazon offered it. It's not an Earth-shaking utility, but for what it is, it's terrific. I don't know what I'd change about it. I use it every day for something. I allows all the flexibility and options I'd ask for. It's well-tho
__label__1 This is my favorite app I have on my Incredible 2. I use it in multiple time zones for my travels, and it is great to pick the right alarm from a list. The quick alarm function is great for short naps or to remind me I need to be somewhere.the night mode
__label__1 I have had this app for months. It's fantastic. It performs all the functions of a regular alarm but also has this cool "gentle wake" system where it plays a sound very softly before the actual alarm to see if you are already waking up. Very cool. HIGHLY
__label__1 I have a habit of turning off the alarm in my sleep and swear there was something wrong with the alarm when I didn't wake up.  This alarm clock is so effective because the actual science of sleep has been factored into its design. Personally I think that
__label__1 I like the explanation for the pre-alarm. REM cycles.  I like how it can fade in my own music quietly, then it follows up with another louder alarm.
__label__1 This alarm app is everything you could ever want and more.  It's completely customizable and completely reliable.  I highly recommend.
__label__1 I got a notice when opening the app that I needed to upgrade (for free) but the Amazon store wanted to charge me. A note to the developer got me a very quick reply, and a workaround. Turns out it's an Amazon problem, not the program, but the developer go
__label__1 It is easy to use.  The pre alarm is interesting, as I tend to be a light sleeper.  Still it does the job.  I was surprised when I allowed the alarm to go and after 15 minutes, it have a loud buzz.  Great if you ignore the alarm.  Nicely thought out
__label__1 I've been using this for months. Worth every penny! Easy to set alarms. Used to do the puzzles but it'd take me too long to figure the puzzle out and it'd wake up the hubby.
__label__0 Seriously, Amazons version is old compared to the market version. Please give Amazon the same updates as market. Otherwise its a pretty good app.Will change my rating when I get a recent update from Amazon.8/23/11 Still outdated amazon market app compare
__label__1 [UPDATE: Increased from 4 to 5 stars.  I use this daily, and it is my go-to app for countdown alarms.  Two years later, this app has gotten better with every update. For me, this is now a "must have" app on my phone.]Up front, let me be clear: I am as se

__label__1 Best alarm I have ever used. No more headaches waking up. I highly recommend this alarm. So many options to wake up with. The ocean is my favorite.
__label__1 I sleep like the dead and this alarm had not failed me yet. There are enough options for power users, yet its simple enough for noobs.
__label__1 This is by far the best alarm available.  Tried them all and no one compares.  Allowing it to gently play at a set time prior to the real alarm is awesome in getting a full rem cycle in and not disrupting you when you are in deep sleep. Awesome app,  it 
__label__1 While it's great that people actually take the time to review the permissions required by an application, please research WHY they're needed before giving an application a bad review. The author has published an extensive list of why the application need
__label__1 The multitude of settings / options can seem daunting at first, but once you understand it all, you'll wonder why you ever used a regular alarm clock. I will never go back!
__label__1 Better than any other alarm clock on market including the one that comes on your phone I would definitely recommend this app
__label__0 The recent update made major changes to this app. They might have been nice, if they had not made the alarm unreliable. I am writing this review at 3:58 am because the alarm went off at 3:30 am for no reason.The app is now telling me that my next alarm i

__label__1 I have been using this app for a long time. The developer every few months has kept on adding very useful features. This has become my only alarm clock that I really on to wake up in the morning.
__label__1 I like the options in this app - changing the snooze time and lead in time are great. I also like the desk clock functionality and customization.
__label__0 another App that doesn't need it but reads your log, reads your phone identity and uses Internet connection.. can you tell me why an alarm clock needs it? I rate any app like that with one star, don't install it and call you to do the same. stop SPYING!
__label__1 I downloaded this app on free day and have loved it since.  Multiple alarms with different fade ins are great.  I really like the way you can have it force you to solve a math problem before snoozing or stopping the alarm.  Would definitely recommend.
__label__1 This App is awesome. It has very customizable alarm settings for when it goes off, frequency and number of snoozes, what sound is played, etc.The pre-alarm is brilliant. It is soft enough to take you out of a deep sleep and put you in a light one for whe
__label__1 The developer really put a lot of thought into this application.  Features are jam packed.  So glad I downloaded this on free day, although I would have certainly paid for it! Has to be the absolute best alarm clock application out there for Android!

__label__1 This is a app made to look for fantastic/great food to eat in your area, or even out!. Read reviews before you even go, and make a review your self when done. Great for road trips, simply add the city your in and no need to call to make reservation, do i
__label__0 open table is a great concept, but in reality really sucks. looking for restaurants to make a reservation and there just like 3. Every time I type the name of a restaurant is not there.
__label__1 Ease of use is the first thing that comes to mind. This app helps you find the right place, book a table, and even confirms everything in a few taps of the screen. Love it, very well done.
__label__1 This app is fantastic for when you want to plan something or just can't find the right place for dinner.  I have used it and am totally satisified with it.
__label__1 Been using the computer platform for years and this mobile app is very useful. No, it doesn't have the full functionality of the full site, but I consider that a positive because more clutter would make it cumbersome to use on the fly. It has what you ne
__label__1 No more easy way to make a reservation...and if the place you want is full,you can find alternatives really easy and fast.
__label__1 VERY USABLE AND WELL DONE APP FOR DININGAND FINDING RESTAURANTS THAT MIGHT BE FUN TO CHECK OUT.PRICE IS RIGHT, TOO!
__label__1 This ap is easy to use and I use it often when making reservations especially when we travel.  I've never been disappointed with the information on site and the ability to make reservations way in advance is probably one of the best features.  Highly rec
__label__1 This app has complete information, photos, menus and reviews of restaurants everywhere and if you make a reservation, you can rest assured that it got to the restaurant!  There is a great follow-up system that reminds you of the reservation when the time
__label__1 Anyone who is looking to dine out at a restaurant within their own city or on a trip, this app allows you to find restaurants close to you and research their menu and reviews online before checking them out. I highly recommend this to anyone who likes to
__label__1 used this to book a restaurant for a group of 11 people, and it worked flawlessly.  Very handy and convenience.
__label__1 I like this app very much.  Have used it to make reservations at a restaurant that had a waiting line.  It is convenient and has a lot of the popular restaurants we would like to check out.
__label__1 This app helps make booking a reservation simple. Messaging for special occasions can be accomplished in just a few seconds.
__label__0 I couldn't get it to do anything, and the Help Menu was worthless. I can not recommend this thing? So I took it off may Kindle Fire.
__label__1 This is a very helpful app for your smart phone. Helps you find and make a reservation quickly AND you get money towards a nice dinner or an appetizer at your favorite place.
__label__0 This app didn't sync my account so I couldn't receive messages. It was a waste and set-up was confusing too
__label__0 The constant database corruption problem effectively renders this app completely useless.  Beware: you may not encounter the issue until after the trial expires and you've already spent your $20.  The developers have still not corrected it though it's be
__label__1 If you use Outlook for your corporate email, then this is a must have application.  It has some functions that are more powerful than Outlook 2010.  I've used it for ~2 years and give it my strongest recommendation.
__label__1 I bought this to help my Kindle Fire become an extension of my work computer. I usually get a ton if email every day, and most of it is categorized, and sorted into folders for action later. our companies webbased solution just threw them through the inb
__label__1 We have a corporate exchange server and we are required to use this App with ActiveSync on most Android phones to meet security concerns.It took quite a while to set it up properly, but once I finally figured it all out, it is working great.  I have zero
__label__0 If you're going to distribute a demo version, be honest enough to put "demo" in the name or primary description so people who aren't interested in buying don't waste their time downloading.
__label__0 Uninstalled this one due to the numerous crashes it caused on tablet it was installed for.  Actually went back to the default app.
__label__0 I don't appreciate the bait and switch. If NitroDesk was more upfront with the the 30-day limit I might have used it. I realize now that the demo part was mentioned in their blurbage, but still . . . it was NOT free.
__label__1 I use this daily for work. it is an essential tool for me as I rely on Microsoft outlook. I use the calender and email for everything.
__label__0 Very bad app had to dump it would not work... could not even get my mail setup... Bad... Bad........... Bad.... Bad.....
__label__1 This time for an update, the calendar got some love. It was needed and the improvements are absolutely spot on. The ability to see the month view and agenda or day view on split screen is genius. It's the subtle features like these that keep me from usin
__label__0 I had a hard time getting this set up. no support and difficult instructions. the web site does nothing to help. would have loved to have this app
__label__0 will not work on my fire for some reason was not able to get pass the sign in search I un installed it from my kindle. I had to go to other apps. I just think they need to avoid making an app a issue to download to your phone or device.
__label__0 The trial was not that great.  Got it to get my microsoft office e-mail and still could not access with this app.
__label__0 This did not work and did not have any tech support or help page that explained what we were doing wrong.
__label__0 I couldn't make it work.  I'd suggest something a bit easier to set up.  There's better apps available in short.  Find one of those and forget this one.
__label__1 I have been using it for two months.  Works without any problems with exchange 2010. Have not ran into any issues after installing the key.
__label__0 I don't know why, but I tried to install this program in my Kindle more than once and always had trouble.  Then, when I was finally successful installing it, it didn't work for connecting to my work email.  It could be something that I'm doing wrong, but
__label__1 I know its $20, I was reluctant at first at the cost, but all the other Exchange Apps just didn't get the job done for me.  The biggest plus is this app actually pulls and displays emails within all folders that you want to see.  I am an email rules/filt
__label__0 Summary:This is one of the buggiest, slowest, most frustrating pieces of computer software I've ever had the misfortune of using.  I had to manually open the app frequently whenever I expected an important work message to come in, because otherwise I'd m
__label__0 were in the world is the equal sign. how is this a speedcalc if it has no equal sign now i see why it is free. DONT GET IT!!!!!!!
__label__1 There is nothing i dislike about this calculator - amazon could take a few cues (with regards to the Kindle Fire) as to whata onscreen friendly input device should be like and work.
__label__0 I consider this a waste, Don't get this, this cannot calculate this problem (.9 divide==) ans is 1.111111111.  Only get a calculator that can  do this simple problem.
__label__0 Tried multiple times to set it up over a span of 4 days. Every single time it says there was a problem and to try again later. Tried SoundHound and it works perfectly.
__label__1 Although I don't have a whole lot of a use for this app it is really neat and very well done. Tested it in a loud Chili's bar and it worked flawlessly.
__label__1 I accidentally hit the button before I was ready for it to identify the song.  I quickly tapped for it to stop listening.  With one second worth of listening, it correctly identified the tv commercial that was playing in the background.  That is pretty g
__label__0 It tells me that I need to do the setup step, but I just get the same error message that it didn't work and I should try again later.  It's done this for a few days, so there is some permanent issue, but the app doesn't give any more details.  SoundHound
__label__0 same issues as others will not load past startup keeps asking to redownload from amazon appstore. Please fix with and update would Love to have the full version that would work past the startup
__label__1 The product works very well. Have had no issues with it since i downloaded it. Very nifty when i want to figure out what song i am hearing but have to clue what it is. Thanks!!!
__label__1 This is really great app.... I just watched a Korean movie n they were playing a Korean song.... well Shazam listened to the music n it picked the movie n Scene from the movie... wow!!
__label__1 great app to buy. music lovers must have this! free version great but limited. it identifies songs quickly. even songs in movies and tv shows! it is awesome. enjoy!
__label__0 Why does this app need to know my location?  Why does it load itself into the background even if I repeatedly kill the application with a force close?Shazam is yet another example of a PAID application that feels they can freely violate my privacy.  I'm 
__label__0 Shazam sucks, 1. it never loads quick enough and I don't get to record the song in time...2. needs lyrics(which SoundHound has).
__label__1 Have been using this for a long time and it works like a charm. Can't imagine why so many people are having problems with this.
__label__0 I hum or sing the same song the exact same way and soundhound is able to find it easily but shazam finds nothing! I have soundhound free andI am sticking with it. Shazam is very disappointing.
__label__1 Ever hear a song on radio but can't figure out the name of it or who sings it? Download this app and you won't have to feel that way anymore. You just have to hold the phone up to the music with this app open and press a button and BAM, it tells you ever
__label__1 I have never had any problems with this app, if you are having a hard time with this app, its probably cause your phone is outdated!
__label__0 Another crap app, that cant differentiate between and market and a damn OUT OF DATE amazon app. The market version is TWO REVISIONS higher than the Amazon Market.
__label__1 I have used this from when it first came out.  I am now a &#34;Music&#34; person just when I heard something it is nice to know what it is/was.
__label__0 Using a Nexus S, it works great but its a little slow, found a lot of songs I thought it would never find... Rage, Skindred, Gorillaz, and even Cage the Elephant
__label__1 This is my favorite music identification app! I cant believe it went on a free day!  This app can do so much! It is astonishing that it can get the lyrics, youtube, and buy the song
__label__0 It keeps giving me a connection error when trying to set up on Xoom. I have uninstall and even tried the free version from the Android Market... Still no luck.
__label__0 Well I got a notification that I need to update well it said new permissions required so I compared them to the previous release the previous one has 9 and this new one has 14 can anyone say overkill
__label__0 This app is not worth 5 bucks. And on top of that,  it won't even work any more.  It tells me to redownload from the amazon market.  And pay 5 bucks when I got it for free yesterday?!  No thanks.
__label__0 Needs update.  Everytime I try to use it, it force closes an says I need to re dl from the market.  Hope there is a fix to this problem soon.  It seems like everyone else is having the same problem.  Evo
__label__1 Great app for identifying music when you don't know the name or artist then you can download from an available music store.
__label__1 This is a great upgrade from the free version. Unlimited tagging is great plus all the other features you love are here. I got it as the free app of the day but it is worth the price tag.
__label__1 I just got this and when I tested it, perfect! I like the feature that it can show you the lyrics. Great app. Thanks for making this!
__label__1 It works great, finds the songs you need and is only second to Soundhound because you can't really hum songs into it.
__label__1 i only tried 2 tags. one on tv and another from a music clip in YouTube. it worked both times. only if i could have had this app years ago when i was recording instrumental music on cassette tapes. i has a few sings i need to know who they are.
__label__1 I recently bought a new truck and one of the features I miss most about my old one is that the radio does not display the name of the song on the radio.  Not the end of the world, but now I don't sweat it anymore thanks to Shazam.Shazam listens to a bit 
__label__1 For me I have had both sound hound and this app and for me this app was far better and faster at identifying songs especially in noisy conditions. sometimes identifying songs almost immediately after pushing the button. Blazing fast and highly recommende
__label__1 I have to start this review by saying I got this particular app free, when Amazon was giving it away in a daily special.  Otherwise, I wouldn't have bothered getting it, due to already having a free alternative, Soundhound, installed.Still, if you're int
__label__0 Tried this out, but it did not recognize anything I tried to use it on.  Not even a "Is this maybe what you want?" - just zero results every time.  I attempted several methods.  Using the phone's speaker normally and cupping it to give more sound to the 
__label__1 I don't know about the bad reviews. I've had this since day one and it has never let me down. I can't vouch for soundhound, don't feel I need to. Shazam never once missed a tag, from the 3 sec tv show or the car with the windows open.
__label__1 Hasn't missed a song yet. Even picking up some indie rock. And it automatically keeps a record so you can go back later and see which songs you listened to that day to download.
__label__1 This app has never ceased to amaze me when I'm trying to figure out a song and I have my phone handy. Great app!
__label__1 Works every time. Always gets the song right. Then I can watch it on youtube or share it on Facebook or buy the mp3 from Amazon. Pretty sick.
__label__1 if you can't get it to install, DON'T LEAVE A BAD RATING. that's more your problem than the developers. mine installed flawlessly. -Nexus S 2.3.3
__label__1 I've been using Shazam since I first got an Android phone (April 2010) and it's always been my go to app when I need music identified.  For the most part it's incredibly accurate, but once you start trying to identify more obscure artists you'll start hi
__label__1 What a great application! Works great on my EVO 4g and because I listen to music all the time this will come in extremely handy. Thanks amazon for the unlimited version for free.
__label__1 The future is now. It never got anything on the radio wrong. Even remixes. An app that can make my doctorate in DJ-ing and my masters in music recognition seem like a waste of time? It's the apocalypse alright.
__label__0 I was originally going to give this app 5 stars, but now that I keep getting the Amazon Appstore: unknown error message and it keeps force closing.. I have to igve it 1 star.. please fix this..
__label__0 One of the biggest features that they advertise is the 3D Lyrics. However, after I purchased the &quot;encore&quot; or paid version that feature was greyed out. I missed the opportunity to get Shazam Encore for free last year, and that is what this is wo
__label__1 I've been meaning to buy Shazam Encore for a while now. This version is ad-free and includes unlimited tagging. Don't forget that any app with ads can send certain information about you to advertisers.Shazam is a wonderfully useful app that you can whip 
__label__1 This it's a five star application, what I don't understand is how it's being given away free, momentarily anyways. It does what it should, quickly and easily with no complaints. A bit expensive normally though.
__label__1 Shazam is now more likely to provide quick and accurate results than SoundHound. This wasn't always the case. I've had this app since it was available free in March 2011. Initially, I preferred SoundHound because the earlier versions of Shazam performed 
__label__1 This app has found 98% of the songs that I&apos;ve searched for, including the ones playing in a crowded room. The youtube link also works well. Evo 4G.
__label__1 This is one of the best apps out there to know what music is playing from tv shows to movies
__label__1 This app is amazing! It works great and I love the ability to tag when there is no data connection. I use it almost everyday. Samsung Galaxy Tab.
__label__1 Have you ever heard a song on the radio, maybe even during a movie, and just couldn't remember the name of the song or who it was by? Well use this app to tell you! It's amazing just push the big button in the center of the app when it's loaded (It's a b
__label__1 Should you stumble accross this review and have the application complain that the application needs redownloaded, if you clear the data of the app from settings &gt; applications &gt; manage applications &gt; shazam, it should work. you may have to reins
__label__0 complete failure and soundhound is so much better get working on 3.0 asap you bunch of losers. Not even enough about this app to fill the word minimum.
__label__0 Was amazed when I went to start of a random reggae song and it guessed it from just the start of a melody. Impressive! And you can do so much from watch YouTube video or listen on Pandora from the results!
__label__1 Works great with my atrix( root). I haven't have any issues with the app. The app does an awesome job and is free. 25 word minimun really Amazon?
__label__1 are no longer a problem with this app.  I love shazam.  works like a charm.  have yet to find a song it did not recognize.
__label__1 im really happy that amazon made this app free for a day cuz I was really fed up with the free version. it works very well and I'm surprised it has only an average of 3 stars
__label__1 I also have a spotify account so it's nice that there's integration there.  Or I just get them from the amazon store.
__label__1 Great app for identifying music! UI is also very nice and simple to use.A definite &#34;must have&#34; for music lovers!
__label__1 if you are like me and you love music but don't always know the name of the song or the artist this is the perfect app.  it will tell you all you need to know about the song and how to get it.  Love this and use it all the time.
__label__0 It worked on my OLD Lenovo Tablet but not my NEW one, with a newer version of Android. A lot of apps on Amazon are failing to keep up compatibility with newer devices. Fix this and I'll raise the the stars!
__label__0 Tried this because it was free and very disappointed. Much slower to ID a song then SongHound. Uninstalling, rather deal with ads in SoundHound. HTC EVO 4G.
__label__1 I wish people would rate the apps and not the issues that their phones have.  I was a shazam user long before when the service was free. I upgraded from my HTC hero to the Evo and wasn't able to grandfather the free service so I had to deal with the 5 ta
__label__0 Amazon Appstore unknown erroropps...uninstalled and re downloaded and same thing...T-Mobile G1 (FroyoByLaszlo-5)
__label__0 I have had Shazam Encore and SoundHound Infinity for the past month or so and have tried them side by side using radio, Youtube, music streams, megavideos and Shazam has yet to identify a song for me.  However, SoundHound Infinity has worked every time, 
__label__1 A ringtone for everyone and every taste....spectacular wallpaper!
__label__1 Zedge carries many different and fun ring/message tones.  Had fun just listening to them.  I found the ones I liked and they were easy to install.
__label__1 I would like this app. But I do ln't have an iPhone or any other smart phone. But it is a good app
__label__1 I love this app, I use it for ring tones, wall papers and my search engine I run to each time I wish to customize my phone at all. Another plus, no annoying adds, really who likes those things?! Only issue I've found with this app is when I try to share 
__label__0 I downloaded zedge and it changes my ringtone. Plus I haven't been Able to use the ringtones.  It defaults to something else. I took it to the Verizon store twice and it still defaults to a different ringtone.
__label__0 Won't even try this.  Thanks to the reviews warning of the filth and foul language prevalent here.  Not going there.
__label__1 Great ace to find some very nice ringtones, wallpapers, and notifications sounds. I recommend this to anyone with an android device. No music ones but you always have ringdroid for that.
__label__1 This is a great ringtone app  Many specialty ringtones for all in family, friends, etc.  easy to download and attach to specific contacts
__label__1 Highly recommend.  It has worked great for the GS2 Skyrocket and I love it is free!  I have only used it for the ring tones.
__label__1 Good to have all the choices of ringtones, wallpaper you want and like

__label__1 You couldn't find any better ringtones unless you want to hear a complete song.  I think it's great and would like more from them.
__label__1 Make sure you clear the cache when you're done choosing a ringtone. There are so many ringtones, you could never go through them all. It has a handy way to listen to the ringtone before actually downloading it. There are ringtones from funny to serious o
__label__1 Lots of ringtones, wallpapers and alert sounds to choose from. Really let me personalize my phone. I recommended it to many people already.
__label__1 which since reviews are just opinions; this app is one of the best things since sliced bread! but that's my opinion. I enjoy it very much. yeah it couldn't include every song by every artist nor every wallpaper. its called umm life yeah it has a wide var

__label__1 If you like different ring tones and alerts and backgrounds this is the place to go have been there many times and love this site
__label__1 I use the Zedge website then found out about their app. It's got a good variety of notification and ringtones. Handy to use when you want to change your sounds.
__label__1 Still using zedge and its 3 phones later and my grand daughter just started using it thanks to the fact that its now i phone friendly
__label__1 Wonderful app for free ringtones and wallpaper. Would definitely recommend this app for anyone looking for a wide variety of ringtones.
__label__1 This is a great app for ringtones &amp; wall papers. There are a ton of choices. I haven't had any issues with it being slow, crashing, or force closing. (htc evo)
__label__1 yes the best ringtone appso now when someone wakes me at midnight from a nice sleepI can wake to are yoy lonesome tonight or even I shot the sheriff
__label__1 One of the things I do to yes, quite frankly avoid people, especially solicitors is give the people I talk to most frequently their own ring tone than I know how quickly run telephone, whether it's one of my children when the extended family or some part
__label__1 Love the variety of the wallpapers and tones. The new live wallpapers are great. Will recommend to anyone. It's nice that all these are in one app. It's real easy to download them and have never had a problem. The quality of the items are very good. Than
__label__1 Zedge is a wonderful app. I am very glad to have it on my phone, make having ring tones a lot of fun!
__label__1 I love that it has so many ringtones and wallpaper to chose from.  I will ALWAYS be able to find what I want on this app.
__label__1 I love this app because it has such a vast selection of wallpapers and ringtones.  I have had no problems with this app.
__label__1 Still have plenty of exploring to do, but am enjoying the experience of it.  Thanks for a interesting app to use.
__label__1 Love this free app.  You can filter the kinds of ringtones & notification sounds to listen 1st, add to a favorites list, download only the ones you want.  Got to put the Law & Order DaDUM sound for text alerts and lots of Big Bang Theory quotes also avai
__label__1 I had used Zedge for years with my old flip cell phone.  I just downloaded it onto my android smart phone and it still works great.  You can find just about any ringtone/notifications on this site.
__label__1 Great selection of wallpapers and ringtones I thought. Plus its FREE how the heck can you go wrong with that. Has a good selection of alarms, sounds, beats, etc. I would recommend for everyone to take a look at this...
__label__1 Great App! Easy to use. Incredible selection.
__label__1 I love this app. makes it so easy to be able to download ringtones and notifications sounds. Since finding this app i was able to get rid of a couple other that were not add good. Would highly recommend this app.
__label__1 What an amazing set of choices this app gives for ring tones, wall papers and alert tones!  Way more than anyone might need, but it covers from A to Z, so anyone can find what fits their style.
__label__1 I really like this app quite a bit, and after recently upgrading from a SGS2 to a Galaxy Nexus, I went to install it from the Android Market, and it was no longer available! So glad it was on here because all the others I've tried stink. I used to use Ya
__label__0 It simply STOPPED working &amp; there's absolutely NOTHING I could do to get it back. I've activated it four times!
__label__0 This was a fake, it promised so much and all I got was a green screen of them asking for money to have a private number. When I uninstalled it I lost my voice mail. All the caller gets now is a busy signal and I get a "no messages" on my voice mail. This
__label__0 This app worked intermittently at best. They sent unsolicited messages and I finally removed it from my android phone. I only had the free version. Maybe the additional fax and would be worth it to some people for a fee.
__label__0 I would delete twitter if I knew how to
__label__1 This app makes my tweeting a lot faster and easier.  I can tweet without dragging out the laptop.
__label__1 Since this app is made by the official team then it is the best choice. this is totally compatible with kindle fire and I enjoy using it. have fun
__label__1 I think this app is good for you and you can follow a bunch people!!! I love this app because you can talk to people who u have followed and who has followed you!!! This is a really good app. So get it!!! Also you can connect with friends near and far. S

__label__1 As long as you have WiFi, 3g, or 4g on your device you can access all up to date tweets from your family, friends, and everyone in between.
__label__1 If you do not like it you must be crazy .But if you don't ok that is your opinion. I did not like it until  my aunt so many y out should look up to your aunt for a better life
__label__1 I had no problem with this app....it works as expected...you get to view and use your twitter easier. Well designed app if you want to use your twitter on the Kindle Fire.
__label__1 yes, social media is an addiction for many and I am pretty guilty of my love for all things twitter, facebook etc...this is the regular twitter app and I'm very glad I have it on my kindle!
__label__1 In the beginning, I had my doubts on Twitter. But really, it's amazing! For those of you that cant gt updates, too bad so sad. Because when I got it, the twitter symbol was still the old one. It updated by itself, one day! So get it!
__label__1 I love using Twitter on my Kindle Fire! It is a great app. and it is really easy to use!
__label__1 amazing app love it better than facebook in every possible way I prefer this than having facebook already also great on my kindle fire
__label__1 It's free, it's easy-to-use, it's convenient. Got this app for my Kindle Fire and I don't regret it. Not much else to say
__label__1 Handy to have on my Kindle Fire HDX for those times when I'm too lazy to get onto my computer.  Works well and doesn't crash.

__label__1 I am a twitter junkie I love it on my kindle since it is bigger then my android phone I just wish i could customize tones
__label__1 I love to tweet! I'm glad that I can do this on my kindle and my phone!! When the phone is on he charger I get on with my kindle and it's bigger for me to read and follow what's going on!
__label__1 Easy to use app, exactly what you think it is. Just like the app on your phone or on your computer.
__label__1 Has a few quirks, but overall it is a very good app for keeping up with your Twitter account on the go. I use it quite often.
__label__1 This works perfectly on my Kindle fire HDX.  I use it every day. Been loving my Kindle fire HDX so much. I use it all the time.
__label__1 Twitter is my favorite social media app.  I love Twitter and I have met a ton of cool and inspiring folk on there. It is a good way to keep up with events too.
__label__1 There isn't much to say about Twitter that no one else understands.  I just love having Twitter on my Kindle.  It is very convenient.
__label__1 This app is great. You can actually use multiple accounts at once for those who have such things lol. I only say this as an author who wishes her personal and professional lives to be separate.
__label__1 Fine App, works well for this ever increasingly popular social networking service. Not buggy at all, good interface.  No problems as of yet and no problems equals a 5 star rating from this guy.
__label__1 With this app you can tweet, keep informed, send information - your thoughts - same as desktop version and even read full pages, too. I give this a far star, rave review.
__label__1 I love Twitter.  The app is the same as my smart phone.  Love being able to continue my social media accounts regardless of the device I am using.
__label__1 I like this app. It is very easy to navigate and I find my self using twitter more now then I ever have before.
__label__1 Great!!!!! So glad I put this on my Kindle. I use it much more now than I ever did on my iPhone.
__label__1 Of course Twitter is cool. I don't go to it as much as facebook but I still like it... .;)
__label__1 I love twitter,honestly it is freakin addicting 2 be on. Its a cool thing 2 be on. I love it.
__label__1 I love this app on the kindle fire it works well I love that u can see everything on the screen.Love twitter
__label__0 I have Twitter on my laptop so I thought I would put it on my Kindle Fire.  I don't like it.  It doesn't save my password and I don't see how to post.  I guess it is just not user friendly for me.  I can usually figure these apps out, but this one just i
__label__1 I would tell people to get it because there is a lot you can do with it and you can talk to famous people
__label__1 I use this to keep in touch with breaking news and also to communicate with some of the folks in power.
__label__1 It does what it's supposed to do. It's twitter and I can get in and do what I need to do with no issues &#34;yet&#34; I probably just jinxed myself now though...lol.
__label__1 Its just perfect it like the best app ever no complains at all its just perfect. This app is just amazing like I said no complains it is just perfect
__label__1 I haven't been on Twitter a whole lot since I got my kindle fire but so far it's just like the Twitter app I had on my phone and the app makes it easy to navigate around Twitter and its just a really easy, no problems app:)
__label__1 I like this more than Facebook. it is easy to use and just better. this is a really great app
__label__1 I like the Twitter app.  It's pretty user friendly and the feed is easy to read.  Just what you need to get a quick update and scroll through tweets.
__label__1 this app for my kindle works just as great as the app for my phone. I can do all the functions i do on my laptop
__label__1 I love it. I feel more involved with the world. It keeps me connected to the local news when I can't watch TV.
__label__1 I've used this application before and I still love it! It is simple but yet perfect for what I like!
__label__1 Very simple to use and am happy to have it available so easily on my kindle fire HD can't imagine not having it at my fingertips
__label__1 I downloaded this to my tablet, as my phone is out of space. Very easy to read the latest tweets that way
__label__1 at first when I got my twitter I couldn't tweet or even follow people but now I have a large social area with all of my friends.
__label__0 This app never works for me. On any of my devices. I must be either tech dumb or too savvy. I dont get it.
__label__1 This app is well-executed and intuitive.  The pictures load easily and it works beautifully with my hdx.  I definitely recommend it.
__label__1 It's Twitter, but on your phone or kindle or whatever. If you were expecting literally anything else you'll be disappointed, but otherwise you'll probably get what you wanted.
__label__1 follow who you want keep up on the news and be able to see when and where things around you are going on.
__label__1 Because I have great messages on it, and find it very rewarding to use. In my opinion it is excellent.
__label__1 Its twitter for my kindle! ! It has all the features you would find on a mobile phone or other device. Keep track of your favorite movie stars, singers, Tv shows, family ect. I don't know why its not rated higher as I believe it definitely deserves 5 sta
__label__0 I am definitely not a fan of the official Twitter app. All of the 3rd party apps are much better, even though Twitter is trying to kill them off.
__label__1 The app works great on my Kindle fire. I use it more so on my Iphone though. If you want it for your E-reader or tablet though, I would recommend it. I have had no problems using it on either.
__label__1 AWESOME app! A MUST have! Installs fast, and never has frozen, or needed to be stopped. Love it! Makes it easy and quick to post my tweets!
__label__1 When ever judgement try to get on the internet it blocks me out so this for the kindle was a great idea
__label__1 When i got this is i wasnt to sure because everyone had bad comments about it. It is great! I dont even have to sign in anymore, and whenever someone follows me or favs or retweets one of my  tweets it lets me know. I have it on my kindle fire, and it is
__label__1 it work's good on the kindle fire h d no promble . it works will.I like to check my message an my followers on here to see what's going on. it works will on kindlefire h d
__label__1 Lets me me use my twitter account on my kindle :) Works great! So yea you have to have so many words to submit a review!
__label__1 awesome cool mini word @share your opinion the reason I'm doing this just to rate twitter awesome fool nine strough
__label__1 The Twitter for Kindle app is very functional and enjoyable to use. I recommend it if you use Twitter and have a Kindle Fire.
__label__0 Worst part is the annoying pop-up that won't stop popping up. What happened? It was working perfectly. May have to remove until devs get it working again.
__label__1 I would recommend this to those of us that have Kindles to read from and everything, then we can share what we are doing with our followers!
__label__1 I am still getting used to the app, but so far it's organized, easy to use, and I never have any problems with it.
__label__1 I love it on my kindle. It will alert you when you get a notice and only shows the chatting page you are on. Some people like it some like the computer version with information on the side.
__label__0 I didn't like it, so I don't use it ..... I am used to Facebook, soooo, enough said, I guess
__label__1 Decided to join the 21st century crowd (although I still find another social media site to be a bit intrusive and creepy) and I like using Twitter a lot.  It is easy to keep up with breaking news etc.
__label__1 Finally, an official twitter app for the Kindle Fire! It's definitely an upgrade from the ridiculous mobile website shortcut. Works great. The only thing I don't like is it doesn't automatically refresh to the top of your timeline when you open the app.
__label__1 I read what others have posted but never post anything of my own!  I prefer checking Twitter on my desktop computer anyway.
__label__1 I'm trying to get the hang I think I do ,I like being on here it great I have a lot more friends then I did thanks....Works fantastic...
__label__1 Just the classic twitter like online or on an iPhone. Works perfectly good, no problems at all. I recommend it.
__label__1 what is not to love about twitter.Allows humans to publish their every move because it is so completely necessary.... lol not... but it is fun!
__label__1 I use it all the time to check my Twitter now. Works just like it would on desktop, if not slightly better. :)
__label__1 This is a very nice app to be able to send Tweets from my Kindle Fire tablet from anywhere there's wi-fi.
__label__1 This app does exactly what you expect it to do and does it perfectly. I don't know why you would choose any other.
__label__1 I am not changing the world through Twitter. I merely entertain myself here instead of chasing Angry Birds, etc... !
__label__1 We all know what Twitter is, this is just a handier, more practical way for me at least to use it. I love having it on my Kindle Fire!
__label__1 Wanted to link to Twitter on my Kindle - so I downloaded the app. Now I can link to Twitter on my Kindle.
__label__1 nice to keep in touch with friends and things going on in the world--would suggest trying it--be careful who you befriend
__label__1 I think that this is best Twitter app ever! I can easily check on all who I follow and posting is just as easy.
__label__1 Of course this a great app! Everyone twitters! Sign up today and get it on your phone, kindle and ipad!
__label__1 This one of the best twitter app!!  there is nothing wrong with the app!!!  Really fast too!!  I wish I could give the twitter app a 10 star ratting!
__label__1 It's Twitter for the Kindle! Works well and does what it's supposed to. Don't go on Twitter very often but when I do, it's on this app.
__label__1 I love reading tweets and responding to people that are watching the same shows as me.  Love the interactive feel of it.
__label__1 This really helps keep me connected to my social media which is amazing, and it updated quickly with a good WIFI connection
__label__1 Easy to sign in and not alot of people posting on my tweet. I like keeping up to date with the latest tweets for concerts and the current news.
__label__1 This app loads quick and remembers where I was last so I don't have to do much than scroll up to now to see what is going on or has gone on.  Lets me read tweets and the links are quick, nice little app.
__label__1 Fun to tweet.

__label__1 I have a twitter account for One Direction. if you love them, follow me @1Dhelper. we're an update account. :)
__label__1 now we need temple run and some of those other good games. please I am dying with these.boring. games. please
__label__1 This app you can not go wrong. It's great for kindle. I love having on my kindle.  I recommend other to use this mobile app.
__label__1 The twitter app is great when I'm on the go and I can keep up with my tweets and followers
__label__1 I love twitter and having it close to me.  it's so easy to use and it's a lot better than Facebook.
__label__1 works very well, nice to have notifications on kn my kindle fire now. still waiting for facebook to release an app here.
__label__1 OMG! I love this app twitter is literally amazing. it rarely loads.... GET THIS APP TRY IT OUT.! best part is its..FREE
__label__1 I love this on my kindle fire. Very easy to use and no technical problems, issues, or bugs so far.
__label__1 Love this app I can tweet anyone. Even movie stars. How you like them apples. I'm friends with Lisa Niemi Swayze.May God Bless Her and her Family and the Swayze Family.
__label__1 This is by far one of the best Twitter apps for Android! Great ui and great features. I would recommend this app to anyone! I wish more devs would incorporate the pull-to-refresh feature.
__label__1 Twitter is great to find all sorts of random facts, news and thoughts. I put Twitter on my KF as a way to keep up on news posts. It works wonderfully! I like using it on the Fire versus my cellphone.
__label__0 I  just do not get any of this system and all this garbage. I think it is time to forget all this andCall on a phone to communicate every . That is a lot easier than  this.
__label__0 The app freezes on launch, and I have to go to the notification bar.  I can't get to the tweet stream.  It worked the first time but never launches again.
__label__1 well dis is a cool app...cnt live w/out it!!! I mean tis twitter!!!!!! I cn even upload pics direct from my kindle fire!
__label__1 Great app for people who like to get their information on thy run. Works well with my iPod and Kindle Fire.
__label__1 If you're into Twitter this is a good app and for me I don't have data on my phone so this is a good option for me.
__label__1 I love having the Twitter app available. It makes it so much easier to twitter when watching TV. It's easy to access and I use it frequently. I use Twitter much more than Facebook.
__label__1 Has changed our society from a drab society into a instant communication group that tells the world when anyone has done something wrong or right.
__label__1 I LOVE THIS APPLICATION. IT HAS SO MANY FEATURES THAT EVEN THE OFFICIAL TWITTER DOESNT HAVE. AWEDOME APP!! Best Twitter App There Is!
__label__1 Love it. It's great on the kindles larger screen. It's the same as it is Ion my iPod and phone.
__label__1 works as expected. nothing fancy. updates properly. nice to read on a tablet instead of a small phone. use it all the time
__label__1 To be silently just tap an icon and go right to my Twitter account makes it so much easier. Signing in once is easier
__label__1 SO GLAD I HAVE TWITTER ON MY BRAND NEW TABLET. MAKES LIFE MUCH MORE CONVIENT WHEN I AM OUT & ABOUT
__label__1 I love twitter but I hate all the extra apps they have for it. The moment you fall in love with one app, they change it or it stops working. But this app is great!
__label__1 This app is just like the real thing on the computer. It doesn't lag, it's very repsonsive, and it posts tweets fast. You can't go wrong!
__label__1 I love twitter, and it works very well on the kindle. I really enjoy reading my tweets and looking at pictures.
__label__1 This app is very straight forward to use, and even though I don't tweet that much, I use it to keep track of where my favorite Food Trucks are! Good design, twitter!
__label__1 I like tht if ur not on the updated one u can save pic and I also like the followers part thts pretty cool to
__label__0 hate it cant log out and when you deinstal it you cant instal it again I would not recommend getting it if you aren't online
__label__1 It is way better than the online Twitter.First of all,you can take a picture of yourself and upload it to your image.Second of all,...It's awsome.So get it.5 Stars.
__label__1 good job on just keeping this app up to date and giving us what we feel in love with the first time
__label__1 I love Twitter! I've become addicted to it. Love getting breaking news and info in a flash. How did we live in this world without it?
__label__1 I tweet all the time. This app is the official twitter app from Twitter, and as far as I'm concerned, it's the best for twitter users.
__label__1 Not really sure how to use it. When I write a message to a follower I get mixed up on how to use it.
__label__1 I enjoy twitter very much. I get to keep up on the people I enjoy watching.It also gives info on sports games and concerts coming.
__label__1 I find information about upcoming books, new author's, contests, etc. Really great idea.Still new to tweeting but I'm getting the hang of it.
__label__1 I was surprised how well this works on my Kindle.  I have the app on my cell phone, but sometimes that screen is just too small.
__label__1 BUT I have to work on learning to use it!  Haven't had the time since surgery. Great tool .. yes!
__label__1 Before the last update the official twitter app was only a web app. That didn't cut it for me and many other people. The updated official twitter app is fast and gets the job done. It also doesn't look half bad. Bravo
__label__1 This app works well on my kindle as well as my Android!  If you want to keep up to date with your Twitter account download this app.
__label__1 meets my need allows alot of functions like on computer even though on cell or kindle good app great function
__label__1 I was using mobile updates for my Twitter updates, until I found this app.  I am so glad I found this app!  It is so easy to use and keeps you current!  I haven't had any issues with it and it has simplified my Twitter-life!
__label__1 I can write my thoughts witn many people. Besides I can follow people I like. It is one of the best apps I use everyday.
__label__1 I don't use Twitter often, but when I do on my Android devices, I use this app. It works great and is very easy to use. Isn't that what apps are supposed to do?
__label__1 Easy to download and configure.  You can use it anywhere.  I like it most for cheering for my teams, athletes during sports events.
__label__0 I thought I would try it.  I went on and checked all my interests and within the first hour I was inundated with a zillion emails from people and things that I had never heard of.  I didn't know that would happen.  I did not check that much, but boy did 
__label__1 This is a very fun app for me, I only follow like a handfull of people, but it is alot of fun to use. Very pleased.
__label__1 I love twitter.  It allows me to read about people that I have high regard for.  I sometimes send messages to others on twitter.
__label__1 This is a great app and I would highly recommend it to anyone who loves connecting with family and friends through social networking
__label__1 Just a beginner to tweeter having some difficulties trying to figure out the product it has so many features and I want to learn whatever I can. My family gave me the kindle H D for my birthday hoping I would enter the computer age. Well I have and never
__label__0 I hate it updated by itself and it wont let me loginhate they need to redo the app. because it doesn't work I and.now i hate the app . they need to fix it.  cant even go online. and go on twitter. I know my pass it wont let me sign in. at all don't get i
__label__1 It you are a twitter fanatic like me you will love this app. It makes it so easy to keep up on all the twitter news and makes it easy to post tweets.
__label__1 This is a great app. I never thought I would use Twitter but I love it. Had a fraction of bugs my Facebook app seems to. Really gets you the information you want right at your fingertips. Easy to follow and understand even for the complete newbie like me
__label__1 Works great and i did not experience any kind of bug.Highly recommended for all kindle fire twitter users.yeah.
__label__1 I love love love to see what everyone is doing.  Sometimes it is silly things like i ate a cookie but other times it is neat stuff people post
__label__0 Twitter is "okay," I guess. Not very user-friendly when compared to Facebook. I'd dump it in a New York minute if I wasn't following a famous relative.
__label__0 If you have to go on Twitter get it. But it is still in the new stage. Very confusing! .
__label__1 Love my Twitter App for my Kindle Fire! I can give a shout out to my blog followers to let them know about a new post and keep up on the latest with my favorite celebrities and sports teams. Thank you Amazon! :)
__label__1 What can I say? It's nice to have the Twitter app on my Kindle. I've had no issues with it, so I'm happy.
__label__1 It's access to Twitter. No more, and no less. I like it. It does what it is meant to do.
__label__1 I am admittedly addicted to twitter.  I love how it looks on my kindle fires screen. It's a great way to keep in touch with friends or cyber stalk your celebrity crush. Whichever you want to do.
__label__1 This is a great Kindle app for those of us that &#34;tweet&#34;.  I love the layout and the larger display.
__label__1 I love twitter, who doesnt? it works great on my Kindle, I like that I can keep up with twitter on many different devices
__label__1 An excellent app for quickly checking your tweets. I use this app on a daily basis and haven't had any trouble with it at all. Love the official Twitter app, nothing beats it.
__label__0 I haven't gotten around to figuring it out yet.  Who cares about what I have to say?  From what I understood people usually write things they regret later.
__label__1 Another wonderful and great app on amazon - Twitter, I use it like it looks great on my Kindle Fire HD. Nothing to think about just get it and it will get you! :D LOL
__label__1 Fun to be able to send out a message to anyone that would like to listen.  You reach more people than you possibly know.
__label__1 Love twitter as I use daily to blow off steam about stupid things Obama is doing to our country and how stupid a majority of us are to have voted him back into office.
__label__1 I love this application you are able to do twitter in your fingertips and keep in touch with you family. I love it.
__label__1 I was getting tired of Facebook, and wanted to give Twitter a try. This is a great app and very easy to use.
__label__0 And this doesn't work good on Kindle.It messed my viewing up.And signing in and just about everything.I hope this was free because I uninstalled it..
__label__1 is a very fast and effective teaching new things every day and excellent application for all the emails and see many more
__label__1 I first joined to keep up with a friend who was in one of my Yahoo! groups. Now I use it for what's going on the entertainment biz.
__label__0 i had this app and everything was fine until i found out that there were tweets i wasn't sending. they were about weight loss and i uninstalled this app and changed my password and it stopped. I'm still unsure but it may have hacked my twitter BIATCH
__label__1 I don't personally tweet a lot and that's mainly my fault because I haven't learned the system yet.  I do follow my family and it's a fun way to hear what my boys are up to.  They know I'm not adept at the system, but they leave messages for me to read b
__label__0 I got the app because when I tried to sign up in a browser it made me do those &quot;recapcha&quot; things and I can not read what they say, then when I try to sign up in the app it keeps saying &quot; sorry, we can not sign you up at this time&quot; WHA
__label__1 Let's be honest: almost everyone has a twitter account whether they admit to it or not. The Twitter app is great for reading through your feed, composing your own tweets, or creeping on celebrities. I recommend it without a doubt!
__label__1 Twitter is a bomb. A cool way to connect with all walks of life and share a word or two of encouragement or surprise.
__label__1 Now I do not have to carry my laptop around just to connect to Social Media.  I was glad to see this app.
__label__1 Twitter has become very popular lately among teens and adults alike.  I like to be able to retweet or favorite someone else's Tweet.
__label__1 this is just like the android version. very stable and fast! love the way it is cleanly done on this app.
__label__0 Not sure why I decided to join Twitter...I figure if I need to get in touch with someone or find an opinion, there are a lot more ways to do it.
__label__1 This app is great.  The twitter feed works properly and you can easily navigate through your Twitter account.  Some parts of Twitter are limited because it is the mobile version, similar to most other mobile versions.
__label__1 If you have a Kindle Fire and a Twitter account, you need this app. It works exactly how you would expect a Twitter app to work. No surprises or bugs I couldn't handle. I figure there will be more features as the software gets ironed out and the Twitter 
__label__1 Its so easy to use twitter on the kindle fire. I use it for the style me girl game :-)
__label__1 I love twitter a lot and this app came in handy. It was easy to use and to check every person I followed.
__label__1 Great app for twitter. It allows users to access and manage their Twitter account and that was what I was looking for. I recommend to anyone with a twitter account.
__label__1 Just like following my sports team and could do without the frills of other options. I hope the spam is kept down.
__label__1 Okay, it's like any other twitter on any other contraption that uses apps.  Why is it that you have to explain in so many words?
__label__1 This app is easy to use and has all the features of the site -- my only grievance is that it doesn't always update your information (new followers,  posts, etc.,)
__label__0 I HATE ALL THAT SOCIAL MEDIA CRAP,PEOPLE NEED TO SAY IT TO MY FACE,NOT HIDE BEHIND YOUR COMPUTER OR PHONE U SISSY.
__label__0 I did not like it at all, and found it to be boring... I guessI'm just not into the Tweet! However, I do like the design of theTwitter blue bird. And that's all I have to say about it.
__label__1 what more can i say, its Twitter!!!!! great app to have! use it every day to follow others and have others follow me!
__label__1 Why did I suffer so long using the Twitter mobile web site?  Their mobile site had all kinds of issues that this app doesn't have.  This app works great on my Kindle Fire (gen 1).  It loads the tweets quickly and reliably.
__label__1 Works wonderfully on my new Kindle Fire HD!!  Highly recommend the download!!  Just another great way to keep with the Jones!! :)
__label__1 Im glad Twitter finally has a real app out on the Kindle Fire now. Its so much better than going to the mobile web version.
__label__1 This app is great. Its a great short cut to twitter. I love this app.  I highly recommend getting this app.
__label__1 I am on twitter all the time. Whether if I am making tweets, or just looking at what everyone else posted; this app is beneficial because it makes it more efficient to navigate.
__label__1 This app is twitter. it works well and has no bugs as of yet. If you like twitter, this is twitter for your kindle fire
__label__1 It you are a twitter lover and user, this is the answer for your Kindle Fire HDX.  Could use a better help section for beginner Twitter users, otherwise, it has all the bells and whistles you need for fun tweeting.
__label__1 This is a fun and entertaining. Just started playing and will continue playing. I will share with my family and friends. Hope you enjoy.
__label__1 Love having it bigger than my phone, works so nice!! Thanks for having the app work so slick! Whoo hoo!
__label__1 My Kindle served as a tablet on a trip where I didn't want to haul a laptop. This app works fine and formats the tweets so you can read them easily. If you can't keep away from Twitter and want it on the Kindle, this works well. I had no glitches, and it
__label__1 I love twitter, it is a wonderful site, to communicate facts, feelings  and fiction! LOLYour followers keep an 'open mind' about details &/or personal feelings
__label__0 Way to complicated to understand. This would be great for someone who has the time to learn all the jargon.
__label__1 I Love it. I am keeping up with my shows even though I am at work. Helps pass a slow day in the office
__label__1 it is da best app ever get it.I like twitter. follow me on twitter I am nytinman1 its the best soical network you can get.
__label__1 Just like twitter, the app for twitter is made for the hand held device. Simple, Easy. Works perfectly with my Kindle Fire HDX 8.9.
__label__1 This app is very effective and it keeps you up to date on news and information on people and news that you follow.
__label__1 I like social apps that allow us to stay connected to friends and family on the go.  Twitter takes it a step further by letting you &#34;Follow&#34; your favorite news, sports and cultural blogs.  Since they are limited to 140 characters...you cannot get
__label__1 there is hardly a difference between this app and the real site. I can tap a tweet, read the article, share the article, return to the twitter app right where I left off. IDK what others are talking abt. (shrugs shoulders)
__label__1 This app does what I wanted. I just click on the little birdy and I am signed in reading tweets and easily can post and re-post etc.
__label__1 I love social networking and this app is so easy to use and works great on my kindle fire.  I use this everyday.
__label__1 I'm loving the Amazon Appstore. The Twitter app runs perfect on my Samsung Galaxy Tab. I love it, the user interface is amazing. Keep up the good work!
__label__1 If you don't already know what twitter is yet, you probably don't care to. But if you know, and have been using a third party app, I would encourage you to give their stock app another try. They have made a TON of improvements lately. The one that really
__label__1 Like the facebook app. everyone likely already has this app, and no one is actually going to read this review and decide to download it based on my review..... BUT IF YOU ARE &#34;THAT PERSON&#34; #downloadit
__label__1 i get to tweet my friends and find updates on tna and wwe plus i get to tweet my superstars
__label__1 deleted &uuml;bersocial for kindle fire for this.. much easier to use.. &uuml;.s. had tiiiiny icons hard to tap even on a tablet. twitter app is just much better all around.. I run two accounts on mine as well. BIG +!!
__label__1 i love this app because i can get on Twitter on my kindle fire. its great . with my recomendation you will want to get it. even better its free!!!
__label__1 It's just a more mobile friendly version of twitter than using the browser.  7 more words required... crap crap crap
__label__1 I have always used this app on kindle and it has served me well. There is a recent update that has thrown me off but I'm sure I'll adjust to the changes.
__label__1 I enjoy this app. It allows me to get on twitter and it is easy to navigate.Some times the feed is a little old but I think it might be my personal internet connection.
__label__0 I guess I am not the Twitter type of person. I gave it a try to follow some simple shows and the very next minute I was bombarded with all kinds of strange people and some very sick in the head individuals. I was threatened and felt so sick to my stomach
__label__1 Now I just use Twitter on my Kindle Fire and it is amazing. It is really easy to use and you can spend hours &#34;tweeting &#34;
__label__1 I use it to update my shop's twitter account with. It's really well laid out, but I still have my doubts about twitter itself.
__label__0 Edited: 3/23/2014: I FOUND A FIX!!! The Kindle HDX can easily handle the full Facebook and Twitter programs. I called my Mayday pals (aren't they WONDERFUL??) And we learned together that if, when you plug in either address and an M is embedded there som
__label__1 I got this app on my Kindle Fire so I could share quotes from Kindle books on Twitter. It works really well for that purpose and, best of all, this app is free! Highly recommended!
__label__1 I love twitter its sort of like instagram but insta gram is better al though they should have the real instagram for free
__label__0 I don't like Twitter at all.  Never been on it before.  And, likely, won't go to the site any more.
__label__1 I like to be able to access twitter now on my kindle, it makes it easier then logging in on the computer all of the time.
__label__1 Love being able to just hit my little bluebird of happiness and be there in the action when we are on the run.  So much easier than using my pc.  Great app!
__label__1 It's very nice to have on my kindle. It is easy to use and much better than the mobile version I was using.
__label__1 this app works amazingly!! loads super fast and alerts you when you get a new follower or message great app;)
__label__1 I love twitter and this app is the perfect setup for it. I don't have any complaints. I think twitter should be more popular than it is.
__label__1 I NEVER have problems with this app. Thank goodness because I check twitter about a billion times a day. And I love being able to access it from my Kindle Fire.
__label__0 You can't find S*** YOURLOOKING for its more like a children's app there is nothing of interest on this piece of S*** APP
__label__1 I havent had any issues with it. I think it works well and nicely mimics the mobile app for iphones.
__label__1 I just love Twitter. It's just another fun social media that we all can enjoy keeping in contact with others. I never have problems with the app and use it daily.
__label__1 I use this app for my One Direction page, and it's fast and reliable.  Much better than using the website on the internet.  P.S. if you're interested in following me on Twitter I am @niallscupcake
__label__0 the app it self just fails .... the updates don't help. please don't waste your time. unless you just have time to waste
__label__1 This is a perfect app. I love how simple it is. You can navigate the entire site with such ease.
__label__1 Works just like every other Twitter app with no issues and very RARE app crashes.  I highly recommend this app.
__label__0 on this app you get no update so you get no new messages and you cant do anything than its also boring. all you do is wait and sit around waiting for nothing to happen so I suggest don't get
__label__1 Its twitter! what is there not to love. I have never had any issues with the app and would defiantly  suggest it.
__label__1 Easy to use. Fast to load. Good way to keep in touch with peeps and the world. I enjoy the updates on life.

__label__1 I think it's because it's an App for my Kindle. That's OK, I don't use it as much as others, but for what it is, I have had no problems.
__label__1 I like that i can keep myself in the loop with friends and news on the books or shows I'm watching.

__label__0 I tried logging in so many times and it doesn't let me. It says incorrect password even though I have had the same password for 3 years now. I changed the password, the same thing. I finally made a new twitter and it does the same crap. I really wouldn't
__label__1 Found out my daughter uses Twitter more than Facebook so I decided to get an account. I'm still finding my way around, but it provides a ton of information in a short time.
__label__1 I love it it basically the same as the Apple version it is so easy to learn get Twitter on Android

__label__1 I'm new to the tablet world and was having trouble getting onto Twitter. I didn't know I needed an app but once I downloaded the app it took me to the sign on page and I've had no problems since.
__label__1 I like Twitter alot, but when you have alot of games, you like playing, you can get lost in a game and time runs out, and then it's time to take a shower, eat dinner, and off to bed, to start a new day, and find your lost in your games again.
__label__1 I enjoy following people that I admire and respect along with receiving updates about current events that might not make it to the regular media outlet.This is my first and only social media forum and I am loving it, Twitter can be tailored to your perso
__label__0 This does not have half of the features that twitter has to offer. I am uninstalling it and I might just delete my Twitter account while I am at it.
__label__1 I am not to sure in the day and time that one can do with Twitter.  Keep in touch with everyone/ or what is important in your life.  Keep it on an stay in-touch
__label__1 I ConSider Twitter wAs A Good System To Enjoy  To Enjoy It To The  End Of Time I Enjoy Twitter As I Love Breathing
__label__1 Finallllllly a version for Kindle Fire. :) I was using another app, that shows the photos without popping up. But even though I decided to use the official app.
__label__1 I like having this on my Kindle.  The hi is good and I haven't had any issues thus far. I would recommend.
__label__0 After update, pictures would not load. Use the Twitter app in the Dolphin Browser instead. Or don't update the Twitter app.
__label__0 It always crashes and never lets me post. I can't believe I even tried this again, such a waste  of time.
__label__1 Twitter is almost on top when it comes to social media,  I love that you don't have the profile b.s. that Facebook asks for and you no who is real and who isn't. Facebook catfish and people making fake profiles is destroying many people's lives. Twitter 
__label__1 Works like it should.No complaints. Everything (except change twitter settings, not app settings) you can do on the computer you can do on your phone :)
__label__0 I wish I could remove my name from twitter. I don't like it and since I signed up I've gotten a constant stream of new web sites.  I remove one and another pops up.  Coincident? Maybe.  Iwont reccommend

__label__0 I have had a lot of trouble with this version of Twitter perhaps I up loaded the wrong version. I can not post from my kindle and it is just confusing. I use Twitter on my computer on my computer with out problems. I think I will be deleting it and try a
__label__1 I've used lots of different twitter apps on my iPhone. This one on my Kindle Fire HD 8.9&#34; tablet really is the best. I find it so simple. It's much easier than using my browser on my desktop or laptop. This Kindle app works seamlessly.
__label__1 liked it ,it is interesting because it is instant . easy to use install ed easy no problems on my kindle
__label__1 I have had no issues with Twitter use on my kindle fire HD. Updates on my correspondences, flowers, tweets that have been favorited, and ease of maneuverability is fantastic. The application makes personalizing your Twitter page a breeze as well. Going b
__label__1 I like it because when I don't have my laptop at hand, I can still tweet about how my friends and I just saw the most funny movie ever!
__label__1 I love it. Last night on 'Dance Moms' , it was a wonderful experience connecting with other people about the show and being able to express my feelings to the show and all the others watching and tweeting. A most have!.

__label__1 This is definately an awesome app, It is very easy to use. I Love to use my kindle for twitter!
__label__1 The app downloaded quickly and works as expected.  I've had no issues with this app since installed.  Very pleased with ease of use.
__label__1 I have not yet learned how to use this app or ignore it either as it keeps coming up on my tablet when I don't ask for it. I may have to remove it soon as it does annoy me. The 5 stars are because it looks as if it will work well for some folks.
__label__0 My Gawd what a bunch of krapp! Millions of morons bitching at millions of other morons. I couldn't get away fast enough.........
__label__0 hard to access at busy times of the day. hard to navigate pages, many enjoyed features not available...ie pdq. The days the paper is delivered it is confusing and difficult to find stories and puzzles
__label__1 I'm glad I've got an App for Tweeter. I used to tweet on my browser. Now, Tweeter is just a tap away. Go get it, Kindle lovers!
__label__1 If I could rate this 10, I would! It's great, my friends had one and I wanted one too, it's great. You can even import your followers and the people you follow to your contacts!!!

__label__0 when I try to vet into twitter is always says that the username ir password is incorrect. so I try to fix it and it doesn't work. and when I think it is going to work it loads forever. PLEASE FIX IT
__label__1 Nice app for the novice user. I don't know all there is to know about twitter, but it works for everything I need it for.
__label__0 it Keep sending me Emails, Wont connect right, Dumb, and other things. 1 Reason why not to purchase is because Freezes and Crashes on My Kindle fire.#1 Amazon Customer
__label__1 Can't do without it--- Me and my Peeps are always tweeting about something or other or just keeping up with the Kardashians
__label__1 It works like a charm, just like the other Twitter apps which we weren't expecting since some of the Kindle apps are full bugs. Pleasantly surprised.
__label__1 It's a little different format from the one used in iOS. I actually prefer this one over the iOS version. It just feels cleaner and faster. I can easily navigate between sections and it doesn't take much time at all to load new tweets.
__label__1 get it get it get it if u have a twitter it is awesome and it works great I think everyone that has a kindle should get one!!
__label__1 works great
__label__1 Love this and have used alot.  I'm able to sit on the couch and read & write about current events.
__label__1 @namesping.  New to it but learning.  I would have never used it but entered a contest on The Ellen show with it and won so guess what. I use Twitter now.
__label__0 This service is for people with egos so large that they feel the need to make every thought and action public and the people who love them.
__label__1 love this app its better then fb anyday so everyone take this advice its foshow with a warrenty and love lol jk
__label__1 Probably great but I am already following too many people and have even picked up a few followers.  Now if I could figure out how to really use Twitter in my daily life (other than following ISS crews and that sort of thing) it might prove useful.  I got
__label__1 This app works really well for the kindle fire hd 8.9 inch tablet :) i love to tweet bout a new book while i read
__label__1 This is easy to use. Easy to update with just a tug on the screen. I prefer to use it over the one in my browser.
__label__1 Twitter is fabulous. How are people even allowed to rate this? Everyone knows that its a good app. I was happy I was able to get it on my kindle.
__label__1 Interesting way to follow people you respect and know.Easy way to stay in touch with people's activities and thoughts.
__label__1 doesn't everyone like to tweet and check what everyone else is tweeting? I don't like it as much as Face book but it's fun
__label__1 Amazon is a company that still remembers what customer service is and also that the customer is always right.  I've done plenty of business with Amazon and it's always a positive experience. A few times I've run into a glitch and contacted customer servi
__label__0 i dont know what has happened to society with this social media crap, stay private people and dont get this
__label__1 I love seeing twitter in such a great app! i love on my kindle fire how on the app the bird looks so clean!
__label__1 It is everything it was advertised it to be. An app for Twitter. It hasn't froze once. And for me that is a big deal.
__label__1 I use it all the time, but you must choose your friends wisely, then again you must do that everywhere. If your friends are letting you know every time they brush their teeth, you've got the wrong damned friends! The inane and insane should be left alone
__label__1 Okay, so if you wanna follow a celebrity or comedian, or anyone, you need this app to see their tweets.Don't you hate it when a celeb pays someone to tweet for them?
__label__0 Good app... recommended to all... Downloaded app to personal cell phone as well.Twitter twitter twitter twitter Twitter twitter twitter twitter Twitter twitter twitter twitterWill use again
__label__1 if i could give it 4 and half stars i would but the only problem with this is that it could run.a.little bit faster
__label__1 I love Twitter, use it all the time, it runs fine on my new Kindle.  Still working out the kinks of the keyboard mode on my new Kindle, but other than that, Twitter runs great on it.
__label__1 Just like the Twitter I use on the laptop. Works fine and I can easily see what I want and get to where I want easily.
__label__1 Like Facebook, Twitter is a great way to keep in touch with everyone who is important to you.  I want it on all my computers, tablets and smartphones.
__label__1 Again, don't know why I need to rate this product as it is a free download and not comming from Amazon.  Hmmm oh well, I highly recommend this product if you have a twitter account and into on line social media conversations.
__label__1 What can I say it coincides with everything else in my life and social media.  Works well with the tablet and responses are immediate.
__label__1 I have never had a problem with this app on my tablet. Great for tweeting while I am in my bed watching my favorite shows.
__label__1 This app is great.  I love that it connects you fast and you can  start tweeting fast.  Load it you will love it.
__label__1 Love the Twitter.  Love following all those fabulous people.  Such a great medium for social media.  This download has worked great, and no bugs that I've found.
__label__1 I&apos;m surprised this had three stars... it&apos;s indispensable for Twitter users - even power users like myself. Still has some bugs but generally pretty good quality.
__label__1 This app I love word well with kindle fire.  It is a good way to keep up. Is easy to use
__label__1 I use this more than the website because it's easier to scroll through the feed than on my computer.  The feed stays where I left it, and since I follow a lot of people, it's very helpful in keeping track of what I've seen.  This app is also fully functi
__label__1 easy to access. Excellent App. Easy to use and access is rapid. Links are supported with no problem. One of the best apps to date.
__label__1 If you use Twitter than you almost have to get it for any mobile device you own. It's nice to have a front row seat into the lives of people you may never get to meet.
__label__1 works great and i have encountered NO problems.  i only wish i would have gotten this app sooner; that's my regret.
__label__1 The twitter app work great on all my devices.I can say honestly I would recommend this app to anyone that uses Twitter.
__label__1 Everyone uses Twitter, so here is where I got to experience it.  I had tried to use twitter on my other computers, but this app is so easy.  Makes you want to tweet all the time.
__label__1 I know people have a lot of different preferences when it comes to Twitter apps, but I feel this app works the best.  The interface is clean, and itbis easy to use.  Never had any issues on my 1st Gen Fire.
__label__0 It looked like it could be fun, but when the app comes with so many intrusions into everything on the tablet I think it is a bit much. Of course, I knew FaceBook was an information gathering tool for the gov long before Snowden said so and no I don't car
__label__1 I love this program. I have it on my computer and IPod, and now on my Kindle. Love it Love It
__label__1 This is a great way to stay in touch with your friends as well follow your favorite stars, businesses, etc.
__label__1 I like reading my tweets on my kindle fire, I read more than I write them myself.  It is fun to read my favorite celebrities tweets!  Sometimes I reply to their tweets, but I usually don't create too many of my own.  I don't really desire to have lots of
__label__1 I have been a Twitter fan for quite a few years & this app is great to keep up with my contacts & keep tweeting
__label__1 It's twitter what more can I say?!Great app works perfect I can't complain!I love this app and I would recommend it!
__label__1 I haven't really tried it yet but I'm sure I'll enjoy it that is y I'm giving it this rating
__label__1 Who doesn't love twitter? (: Works pretty nicely and I love twitter. I haven't had a problem with it at all.
__label__1 Does exactly what i want it to do which is take me to twitter so that I can check it
__label__1 love this app. it works great on my kindle fire hd. much better then checking my twitter on my phone. a must have it you use twitter
__label__1 I am definitely tweeting more since I downloaded this app!! That's saying something because I thought Twitter was ridiculous now I m tweeting away. Chirp, chirp.
__label__0 I don't really use Twitter but my nieces really like to use it so for that reason I will give it 1 star!
__label__1 I have a few people I like and I follow them and enjoy reading what's going on in their world sometimes.
__label__0 but generally a waste of time.  I find little of relevance to my daily life and I'm discerning in who/what I follow.  Bothered by intrusions from those in whom I have NO interest.
__label__1 I like twitter and this app is easy to use and helpful. Easy to keep up with things in life
__label__1 Have no complaints with this application so far. This is the social media I prefer to use so I am hoping the smooth operating continues.
__label__1 Works wonderfully. It is way better than any other Twitter app I've seen to date. It's smooth and easy to use. Love it.
__label__1 It's twitter. It does what it's supposed to, and it does it surprisingly well. the new updates were a little buggy, but it works
__label__1 Love this app and its very easy to use. Pretty much self explanatory and the coolest part is I have actually gotten several responces from real celebrities from official accounts!
__label__1 Makes it even easier to get up and check my twitter. I haven't checked twitter in a little while since #TWD is done right now, but I know I can check it anytime I want now.
__label__0 No idea how to interact with this.  I read the posts of a few famous people but that is all.
__label__1 heyo dis site iz so awsome cuz u can lik follow peepl and wen they tweet or post a message it goes rite on your page and u can send tweets to celebrities and its just a lot of fun!
__label__1 I am new to Twitter.  I don't know how to use the features yet.  I like reading the tweets. Time will tell.
__label__1 The twitter app is just as good as any facebook, fantasy football, pinterest, email, etc. apps. You can do whatever you need to for your twitter account, updates, and followings.
__label__1 I dont know how anyone can not like this site lol I use it on my laptop, kindle and my cell phone. Love it!!
__label__1 I like the quick responses that reflects back in minutes and  the great conversation with people from all over the world.
__label__1 I love it!!! I tweet alot and it always works. It's like I'm on my computer because has all the features!
__label__0 I'm just not into Twitter, so I deleted it.  I already spend too much time with Facebook!  Maybe I'll use it later??
__label__0 I could never sign in after I set up my account and posted my first tweet.  It kept sending me to the browser to sign in because it said that my account was suspended.  I tried to sign in in the browser but the security words that it wants you to type in
__label__1 I read it everyday and have no problem with it at all.  But haven't read any for awhile due to lack of time but will resume it soon.  But it is really great to have it on Kindle Fire and easier than iPhone which is much smaller and sometimes hard to read
__label__1 This app is great. You get to share your news with people, without the intrusive privacy invasions that facebook has recently become. A+ app.
__label__1 This is a well-built app - they anticipated how best to get news and tweets out on the fly. And it's easy to use!
__label__1 I love twitter I have met many new bands and have met many new directioners a I get updates on yours and just about everything
__label__1 Love to use this app. 140 characters or less to state your option. Good to talk about many issues from Breakfast to Immigration. Can even use it ti share pictures of your food.
__label__1 Twitter good ole Twitter it's got everything it's just Twitter on your kindle you get what you expect. If you like Twitter get this app
__label__1 Twitter is awesome and it works especially great on the kindle fire. I'm on it all the time &amp; sometimes it freezes up but I think that's just my Kindle, not the app. I say get it!!!!!
__label__0 this app does not work well for me. It can barley function and when ever I press on one thing-  it does the opposite.  honestly I do not think you should get this app.
__label__1 I'm using this to save all of my dates. I always have my Kindle with me, so it's readily available. I like that I can just write with my finger or an electronic stylus rather than typing with the little pop-up qwerty. Less typo's and auto-corrects that w
__label__1 This app helps me when I cannot find a pen...I can just jot down it on here and transfer to my calendar when I get home!!
__label__1 I love this app.  IT the easiest calendar to use. thank you.  ICan easily check it everyday and not miss anymore appointments.
__label__1 Well I was optimistic but I really like it. You can write notes and make it your own. All you have to do is swipe to your right to go to the next month and swipe up to go to the next year over all I love it. they could add more Colors but it's a good app
__label__1 I have never been the kinda of guy that really ever needed an organizer.  But I started using this app and I like it.All you have to do is click on a day, then add your event.  You just write the event with your finger.  You can choose different colors f
__label__0 I was looking for a simple calendar, not this. I deleted it because I didn't like how complicated it seemed.
__label__0 Oh, dear, this is the second calendar app I have tried and I can't figure this one out either. Nothing seems to happen despite my attempts.
__label__1 you wake up and have your day's plan at the tip of your fingers. You will find this app at as a very good planner.
__label__1 I like this app but too much porn ads.I'm a child knowing about porn .it said porn on the ad.
__label__0 This app is pretty much as basic as it gets. I downloaded it for my fire. You can add memos but not much else. I'll keep it until I find one with better functionality.
__label__0 It's not easy to since with email. I would like to use it but since it will not since with my email I can't.
__label__1 i have been searching for a plain calendar app for free and not one was good. this one is perfect, and simple for my kindle fire.
__label__1 Have several and like them all for various reasons and they are so handy to have right at your fingertips.
__label__1 This app is awesome. It helps me soo much for my daily planning and memos. It helps me get really organized! I would recommend this app. You should get it. I hope my review helped. :)
__label__0 This was confusing to use and I simply deleted it rather than fight with it. Often it wouldn't load at all.
__label__1 I like this calendar app.  It is easy to use with the keyboard or handwriting.  Great app to have handy.
__label__1 This program works excellent on my Kindle Fire, and "syncs" nicely with my Google Calendar.  Don't waste your time on the free ones!
__label__0 too hard to use. it was fun to play with but I need to get the business done when shopping
__label__1 After I figured how to use it with the icons and reminders it was great. Its the only calender I use now.
__label__0 I thought this app would be great, but heck no!!! its so cofuzing and you cant type anything, I wouldn't ever tell a friend about this!!!:( disappointing
__label__0 It was free.  What more can I say, there are others that are much better.  Needless to say I use another calender now.
__label__0 Installed and uninstalled.  Needs a lot of work and fixs. Hope the developer will take the time to improve on a good base of a program.
__label__1 This is a great app to become more organized. It was really a huge help during high school soccer season and will be more helpful during cheer season! YaY!!!
__label__1 I like this app a lot and its free.  I like to jot down notes sometime to remind to do stuff. It works well with my stylus pen and Kindle Fire. I would recommend this app to others.
__label__0 I downloaded this calendar to my Kindle Fire. You use your finger to write memos to the calendar after touching the applicable date on the calendar. To go to the next month, slide your finger across the screen. However, I could not find a way to type a d
__label__0 Hated it downloaded because its free deleted it just as fast dont waste your time there are better apps out there.
__label__1 Ads aren't too bad. That quick finger note is not very accurate but works well. Nice quick finger note. Short learning curve - but you need to test.
__label__1 never buy another ringtone again! this app uses the songs already on your phone to allow you to make a custom ringtone from any part of any song. i always hate how the ringtones you buy cut off at weird spots or they never have the best part of the song.
__label__1 This music maker is very simple to work.  You just need music on smart phone or maybe any cell phone and it will make a ringtone a couple of simple move.
__label__0 That was total junk. Never even ended up using it and I sure wouldn't recommend it. Nothing but a waste of time for me.
__label__1 You can click on any music in your music file on your SD carrd, and pull it into the ringtone maker program. Cut it where you want and then save it as your main ringtone or attach it as the ringtone for a friend. Perfect!
__label__1 Lots of fun making my own ringtones from favorite songs that I have downloaded to my new Galaxy II S. Not hard figuring out the controls. I esp. like being able to clip any part of a song and choosing how many seconds it runs for. You can be very precise
__label__1 I first tried mp3 cutter and ringtone maker!! and was unable to make a single ringtone because it continuously crashed. Then I tried Ringtone Maker and it worked perfectly. It is very easy to use and very fun making and assigning ringtones. LG Optimus G 
__label__1 Best ringtone creator/assigner I've managed to find yet. Does almost everything I need it to. Assigning individual txt tones would be nice...
__label__0 Why would this app need permission to access protected storage areas of memory,  read and modify contacts,  check network connections.  Way too much access for a simple utility program,  no way I'm installing this app.
__label__0 I don't know if it was me or the app, but lets just say for posterity's sake, it's not you its me.
__label__1 I really like this app  Like many apps, it will not let you choose the directory or what you want to do with it.  If it is in the alert directory, then it must be an alert right?So, it works well and I have had a lot of fun with it.  Would love to be abl
__label__1 This the best ringtone maker/ editor  on Android.Easy functions for cutting /saving/ assigning your preffered tone.Did i mention it is free?.Works with Samsung Galaxy S2 and Ramos w12 tablet.Also tones can be shared by email,bluetooth ,gmail,facebook,etc
__label__1 I recorded and made personalized ringtones in SECONDS for all my individual idiot coworkers. A shotgun blast for one, Wilhelm Scream for another....LOVE THIS APP!!!
__label__0 For some reason, only about 1/4 of my songs on my SD card actually show up in the search. I also wasn't able to get it to make one I did find into a ringtone. It did the preview, but never saved it as a ringtone. I have an LG spectrum. It did work for so
__label__1 I love this easy to use app that helps you customize your ring tone.  I get frustrated when I really like a song, and there is a long musical intro at the beginning of the song. Traditionally on most phones you have to use the ring tone from the beginnin
__label__1 This app is absolutely fantastic. The app does exactly what I want it to do without any lagging or crashing. Honestly I thought this was going to be another piece of junk, but it works perfectly. I really didn't like the notifications my Kindle Fire came
__label__1 There's always a question of function when related to the Kindle Fire HD. I was pleased to find there are no issues here. This application delivers what it claims. There doesn't seem to be any bugs as I've ran it. It does sport ads, but they're tolerable
__label__1 I have a lot of fun creating my ringtones from music on my phone with this app. I can make my ringtone as long or short as I want. I can pick just a chorus or verse from a song or a spot in a classical music sequence. Love this app
__label__1 Really easy to use and understand.  Doesn't take a brainiac to make your own ringtones out of any downloaded music.  Quick too.
__label__1 Knowing that I have a phone that cannot register multiple touches that well (and most other ringtone maker apps rely on it), I love it to death. Does exactly what it says and does it well. Keep up the great work!
__label__0 I got this so that I could use my music on my sd card for alarms and ringtones on new phone.  It didn't work for me.  No instructions and I couldn't get my rings off file. Glad it was free.
__label__1 This app is easy and fun...make clips of music so that its the part of the song that you want by dragging the bars...simple and fun.
__label__1 So so so easy to use to make your own ringtones or other notifications.  Once I got started I ended up making more ringtones than I needed just because it was so fun to use my own music and clip out the snippets I wanted.
__label__1 Start and stop your ringtone melody wherever you want, then save it. Magnifying the waveform helps pinpoint the exact place you want at the beginning and end. Other reviewers give more details, so I'll just add that I like this app and give it 5 stars.
__label__1 Love this app w what ever song you have on your phone it will tack and you tell it where you want your ringer to start and stop in the song I have get this for 2 phones and would g stir agin
__label__1 This is by far the best app I have downloaded yet. It says what it does and it performs great. It is easy to operate and best of all you can make any sound file your ringtone and edit any song to exactly the ringtone you want!
__label__1 I love that I can take any song and choose any part of the song to cut for my ringtone. You simply play the song of your choice thru this app and take the bars on either side and slide them to what you want to be the beginning and end of your ring tone. 
__label__0 dumb...pointless...and the girls arent even hot. just sticks and bones...at least it was free.( word limit word limit word limit word limit word limit)
__label__1 Love it this is a really fun app a good time killer!  The ladies are good looking! Blah blah blah blah blah blah blahblah blah blah blah blah
__label__0 Junk. Doesn't let you see the image but a second. Gameplay of ok though. Image updates would be nice too.
__label__1 Trap balls in a box and reveal the pic beneath. I have played a lot of versions of this game going back to the late 80's and love them. Glad to see the classics don't die. The sexy pics are a plus.
__label__1 To the idiot that can't read and thought this was a golf game and then gave the app a 1 star because of your failure to read. Pay attention to app descriptions before you download, or don't leave feedback!!
__label__1 Works perfectly on my DroidX.  Used it on my local course which was listed on the courses available (that surprised my a little).
__label__0 I've had this app for over a year at this version. Their web site says they are at version 1.8 (or 2.0..... Hard to tell). I sent an inquiry asking how to upgrade and they told me to buy it from the play store since they can't update it on Amazon. How's 
__label__1 I've used this app mainly for distances to greens as well as some stats (driving distances, etc.) It is accurate and i was able to get through an entire 18 holes without draining the battery. Most people I've talked to that use a smartphone GPS app for g
__label__0 I live in Peoria, il and there are no courses available in the area.  This is a major city and for the app to have no courses available without mapping them yourself is ridiculous.  If the devs are charging for this, they really need to be adding some ma
__label__1 I don't play golf but there is always a chance I'll take it up some day. Its nice to know that I'll have an app waiting for me when the time comes.Some actual useful review information: it installed and runs fine on my Moto Defy (Android 2.1). UI looks e
__label__1 Worked on the course next to the house. Found out I was 167 yards from the pin. Pointless to use if your not a golfer, but the app works great if you are.
__label__1 Been wanting to try this still for a while.  I have not played a round of golf with it yet but the features and layout look good.I usually use free caddie pro which seems to have more features, but it also costs ten bucks. This app is a steal at the pric
__label__1 Don't bother even downloading unless you're a golfer. It does nothing useful off the course. That being said, I can't wait to try this nifty little app out next time I get time to play a few holes!
__label__0 Actually bought this from Google market expecting it to be better than Free Caddie. Almost no courses in Michigan have I found. Stunning considering the number of golf courses per acre here. The web interface to map your own is horrible. It won't use you
__label__0 Im not going to do your job and map it all for you im sure the price will go up as we do the leg work filling all your maps.It was a nice try getting it as a one day free app get a lot of people out there on a nice day walking the course so you can get p
__label__0 I can't believe this is a paid app.. This basically google searches local directions to golf clubs... This app sucks hard.. Shame on you whoever made this!
__label__1 To those IDIOTS who rate this poorly because they &quot;thought it was a game&quot; ... if you are too stupid to read the description then you should be blocked from reviewing. Rate based on the apps performance, not your mistakes.
__label__1 I was fortunate to grab this app with Amazon's FREE app of the day. I have used Sky Droid Golf GPS for five rounds of golf so far. Each round, I compared each holes readings to my Sonocaddie V100 Golf GPS unit, all the reading are spot on accurate. Sky D
__label__1 I  use this app on my Kindle  to  keep myself  well informed and  up to date on the Security ,  Microsoft and Internet Media  news pages on Cnet.com.  If  you real  like  the site cnet.com,  then I would  recommend this app on  any cell phone or tablet
__label__1 I have installed this app on both my Ipad, Iphone and Kindle Fire.  If you want to keep abreast of what is happening in the technical world this is a must have. The news is up-to-date and will list the current reviews.  There is a variety of news on all 
__label__1 Info is up to the second current with all the latest geeky stuff.  I tend to rely on it exclusively for information regarding use and suitability of current electronics/net/entertainment.  Followed their reccos to get my HTC-One which is really a superio
__label__1 THIS IS A GOOD APP IF YOU WANT TO KEEP UP WITH CNET. SMOOTH AND HASNT CRASHED (YET) LOL. RECOMMENDED.
__label__0 I use this app occasionally but only with occasional results. More often than not it takes an eternity to load and is very sluggish once it does.
__label__1 CNET News has allot of great news and great articles now compared to when it first came out. Tested at 100%, and after I got started reading, I couldn't stop to do the new review. Allot of Tech and News with many things to choose on the sliding menu. CNE
__label__1 When you are trying to learn that piece of info that will help you to spend money on any electronic gadget Cnet is the site to go to read reviews and get that info you need. I do not read only cnet but the people that give reviews are pretty helpful and 
__label__0 Installed this app on my kindle fire hdx and it runs so slow and takes way to long to load content. It doesn't always play video.The app runs much better on my Nexus 7 first gen that has lower specs. Please fix!
__label__1 Cnet is a trusted site for product reviews if your going to make a purchase and you need to find the best model or brand for the price.
__label__1 I read C|net daily.  App works great.  I find lots of great reviews and recommendations on C|net.  If you like tech, you need this app.
__label__1 When it comes to staying on top of trends and product reviews I go to CNet first and foremost enjoy.!!
__label__1 Cnet been around for some time now and it owned by Discover CBS. You'll get all the up to date in the tech world from some of the best tech personality's in the industry of tech.
__label__0 Figures competing from a sub par review cite we get a bad app. Poor design and most times ads make the app impossible to view. Deleting. The verge is much better  to go to anyway.
__label__1 The CNET news app is a must have for those who wish to keep up with everything happening in the high tech world. I have to monitor my time spent with this app as it's easy to blow 20 minutes reading the articles.EXCELLENT PRODUCT!
__label__1 CNET is my go to site for reviews of electronics I:m considering for purchase.  Very detailed reviews and good information.
__label__1 I am also a tech info nut, i love to see what is coming and this Cnet app helps to keep me updated. You can watch videos and read articles about tech (of course) The videos work very well and you can choose the quality to watch them in. It is just so inf
__label__1 Since I am home disabled I still try to stay informed in the IT community that I worked in for 13 years and CNET offers me that opportunity. It has product reviews and current news what more can a geek ask for.
__label__1 Great App for checking reviews of all manner of products, It is just one more tool in the chest to help evaluate the many products that are on the market and on line where you don't have hands on experience.
__label__1 Good app and well made.
__label__1 A good go to resource with currnt apps, etc. described in detail.  The down side is Goole's strangle-hold on apps distribution through them.
__label__1 I am a big fan of CNET. I like how they review pretty much anything in the tech world. They have very trustworthy reviews. Now I can access all that information off of my Kindle Fire!
__label__1 i really feel sorry for those of you who gave a low rating because it is too hard.It's a fun concept, and it works.  Those who like World of Goo will like this i think.edit: Just wanted to update.  I downloaded this game, and found it to be a wonderful w
__label__0 Application (amazon app?) forced close while trying to install in samsung galaxy s phone.  Amazon, you need to be sure you app will work.  Disappointed.
__label__1 Add speed control or frame by frame fwd/backwd or pause/go so we can closely see/pinpoint stress and failure sequence. Provide more creative twists to game. Absolutely love it.
__label__1 Great game. It doesn't stay easy for long and it works great on my tablet.  Can't wait to see all the levels.  Would recommend to friends.
__label__0 game was poorly designed and executed. The interface was horrible because you have to point where you want to build, but the problem is that your finger is in the way. I spent half the time correcting errors in placement. There was an option to use a cur
__label__0 Sadly, it force crashes before I even get a chance to do much of anything. Using gTablet with stock OS.And now I have to type some nonsense because my review was as quick as the game play on my Droid.
__label__1 For me this game thankfully picked up where Spaghetti Marshmallow dropped the ball a few months ago (when Spaghetti Marshmallow, previously one of the best android games, stopped updating). I love this game! It's so challenging... Though hinged concrete 
__label__1 Excellent game.  The physics are a bit dubious, but seem a reasonable approximation.  Some of the solutions remind me of the wonky third world bridges I've seen.And as a bridge builder myself, I find I have to throw out a lot of &quot;tried and true&quot
__label__1 A simple enough concept, build a bridge across a chasm.  Except you're never given quite enough girders to make an obviously safe bridge, so you have to improvise and cut corners.  Sometimes the bridge holds up and the train passes safely.  Sometimes the
__label__1 I have been playing this game all weekend, and I think it's great. It gets very challenging and really makes you think about how to not kill these people in the trains lol
__label__1 I feel badly I've derailed so many trains trying to learn how to build bridges lol Seriously having a good time with this one.. thanks for making me think!
__label__1 Love everything about it. Challenging, fun, and an excellent way to shrug off bouts of boredom. New graphics are wonderfully whimsical and compliment the gameplay nicely. Overall a worthy buy for anyone who enjoys these types of building games.
__label__1 This game is original and very challenging.  I wish the tutorial was a little more thorough,  but I suppose that would make it too easy.
__label__1 The game is extremely fun and challenging, I have been stuck awhile. I do have an issue with it force closing when I try to open it once in awhile though. It shows promise!
__label__1 I got the game from the Android Market, but I wanted to review it on here anyways just to support a great game. This game makes you think out what you have to do, has great and colorful animations, and, this is my favorite, give you a giggle or two every
__label__0 Runs very slow on Evo, and has issues in game.  It likes to get stuck at the tutorial and the only way out is to close the game and start it up again.  After that it works ok.
__label__1 Ignore the angry 2 start review. This game is great! I originally got this from the android market, but I wanted to review here too. Great concept (not like world of goo) and executed well. Used the free version but upgraded to paid.
__label__1 I got this game when it was free so haha suckers. anyway this game is very detailed andy extremely fun to play and actually takes quite a bit of thought to complete
__label__1 goo ever looking like a train.  Either way, this is a fun &amp; challenging game.  I'm only on level 4 and it really makes you think about all the details and analyze everything.
__label__1 This reminds me of a bridge builder game that I had with my students. I recommend this game for anyone who likes structural engineering. Good that it also the free app of the day.
__label__0 this game is first of all hard to use and the pieces never go where you want. secondly you can't beat the levels with properly engineered structures but must rely on a hodgepodge of webs and strange constructions. uninstalled. samsung galaxy x
__label__1 Great physics game that has developer support. Updates are released often including new materials, higher difficulties, and sandbox mode. The only downside is that it's a little light on levels.
__label__1 I've had this game on my tablet for a while, but never got around to downloading it to my phone until I noticed it was the App of the Day.I have to say this is a really great physics based game.  I really enjoy building the bridges...but honestly, what I
__label__1 THIS GAME IS SO FUN AND ADDICTING I would reccomend getting this game nowif you don't then you are missing out on a lot of fun.
__label__1 Loved the free version and wanted the paid version, and now thanks to amazon, I finally have it. Gonna be wasting a lot of time on this.
__label__1 I love X Construction it is a challenging game that takes the time away $1.49 is a good price because you also get the sanbox levels.
__label__1 X Construction is extremely addictive. It does a good job simulating stress. Most solutions are possible in the real world, but some break and still work. Like I said, you have no idea how many hundreds of hours you will spend on it!
__label__0 I tried this game when it was free and a few times after updates and I must say this game has the worst physics I have ever seen. You are REQUIRED to use the set up focal points marked in white for every level.  You cannot make your own. If you try to, t
__label__1 Runs so smooth on my evo 4g. Makes you think about what really goes on in bridge building! Ha. Love the sound effects.
__label__1 I like the game. the physics are completely off but that makes it very challenging. you'll spend a lot of trying to find the right combination.
__label__1 This game is a lot of fun. I highly recommend it. Try out the free version first, but the pro adds much functionality. runs pretty smoothly on my DInc
__label__0 What's worse, now that I've uninstalled it, Amazon won't remove it from my list, a constant reminder that I should never have downloaded this app.
__label__1 Runs flawlessly on my MT3GS running CM7.Great app of the day choice, but knowing what i know now, i would pay the $1.49 the dev asks. It looks like this app would provide a great repeat challenge as you try to top your personal bests. The sound effects r
__label__1 Very fun and challenging game. The new levels and unlimited playground modes are well worth the upgrade. Dev is responsive to suggestions as proof by the added  construction materials.
__label__1 Had the free version from android market and loved it. Now I get the full version for free.Very addicting and fun. Love the screaming passengers when bridge fails.
__label__1 gets hard later and need more levels but it will keep u entertained for hours and I have to make this 25 words so it will let me post it that six on amazon part
__label__0 Played the first level, then locked up, time to hit the delete button. Really need to correct this, then send me an update.
__label__1 This game brings out the creativity in you. it makes you think more and helps in critical thinking. you will realize that a lot of time already passed by
__label__0 I have a kindle fire, and this game still doesn't work. It is also extremely difficult to play. I can't get passed level two, and I am pretty good at most games. It is very glitchy, and I highly reccomend NOT GETTING IT!!!!! I uninstaled after I quit lev
__label__0 I hats this game with a passion. It is impossible to complete the second level. I spent an hour trying to do it and then gave it to my friends to try. It needs to be easier!
__label__1 There was an old game called Bridge It that started it all.  They have even remade it for PC in 3D now.  Others took off different routes like World of Goo, etc.  It is always good to find someone continuing the tradition, and this one did pretty well fo
__label__1 I was pleasantly surprised by this game; the puzzles are fun and make you think and the graphics and music are really nice. Recommended for those who enjoy realxing puzzle games!
__label__0 i do not reme mber play ing this game but that is ok i guess. here is a review to get this s***e off my feed stuffs
__label__1 Test device - Samsung EpicGameplay - Kind of like good old Snake, but you have to cover every square inch of the place, one block at a time.  While you can take your time to plot your course out, time is being kept and can affect your score.  If you need
__label__1 gotta use your thinking skills on this one for a good score or the clock runs down and its a zero you can still play but its no score
__label__1 very addicting and there are so many levels or puzzles. it is a great mind game. play oftencan be a challenge.
__label__1 I bought the game to get rid of the ads because this is one of those games that challenge your mind in a good way.  The objective is to get from point A to point B by using every square once, you cannot cross your path twice.  It's a good one to keep on 
__label__1 The infamous XDADevelopers forums on your phone. The premium app differs from the free version by including access to legacy device forums and the ability to set your preference for going to either first, last or last read post(s). I highly recommend the
__label__1 This app is a must have for XDA users! It has a matching theme that matches the XDA website. This app has tons of features and supports a great mobile development website!
__label__1 This app allows me to easily follow development news for keeping my tablets up to date.  XDA runs very smooth on my Sprint Galaxy Tab.  I use it daily.
__label__1 Still doesnt have the latest update. i was worried about amazon being able to keep up. its frustrating when the android market keeps reminding you of an update that you have to download here.
__label__0 Makes more sense to buy tapatalk and have access to all your forums rather than getting this buggy piece of work and only being able to access their site.
__label__0 If Amazon would update their apps as quickly as the market with Android does.Tired of the apps not being updated through Amazon
__label__1 Good app. No problems to speak of and it can be fairly challenging. Music is peaceful and can be very relaxing.
__label__1 Great little puzzle game.  I saw another review that didn't care for the music but I love the soundtrack.  It is running flawlessly on both my Droid X and Toshiba Thrive table.
__label__1 like the music, graphics &amp; the whole concept of the game. Worth buying it definitely becaise is entertaining, but i got it as a faotd so thats awesome. Thanks!
__label__1 Incredibly well done. Very brain straining and fascinating puzzle game. Many many levels and they just keep getting harder. New favorite.
__label__1 love this game. fun and challenging. Music is relaxing and helps with the mood of the game. Flowers when you win is a cute touch.
__label__1 I like the game. Graphic are all right. Pretty challenging at times. Definitely recommend this app to people who like puzzles. HTC Incredible MIUI.
__label__1 I'm so tired of trying to read reviews about an app, games, etc,  and seeing reviews that have nothing to do with the product! For every good review, there are twenty tools that think it's the dev and rate it down. That's followed by more people rating u

__label__1 Nicely done puzzle game. Makes you think. It reminds me of the palm pilot games I uses to play.Works perfectly on my HTC Aria.
__label__1 This is one of my favorite games that I have downloaded from the Amazon App Store. It's nice looking, has great music and makes for a fun challenge.
__label__1 I love this game!  Puzzle games are a funny thing...they can either be too easy or too hard, in which case you will lose interest quickly and delete it off your system.  But sometimes puzzle games hit the mark just right, and BAM! you got an awesome game
__label__1 Really enjoyable casual game, with beautiful graphics and a nice soundtrack. Well worth the price... but even better for free!
__label__1 Works great on samsung contiuum and Asus transformer. Easy yet fun. Even my toddler loves it.  Nice easy on the eyes graphics.
__label__1 One word.. ..says it all.. ..InfeCCtious! HandyGames has created a great looking game that started challenging me right out of the gate. It plays and looks incredible on my Asus Transformer (10.1 tablet running Honeycomb 3.1). One of the features I enjoy
__label__1 The game is clearly a puzzle game and puzzle games rarely have a back story or lots of action. It's free, so find something new to complain about.The game is somewhat challenging. It's not overbearing and is a moderately decent time waster.The game funct
__label__1 I loved this game.  one of the few I have actually played all the way to the end before deleting.
__label__1 At first it didn't seem like much but after awhile of playing the game its actually not bad and does get abit difficult...although it can get repetitive after long playing periods but none the less DOWNLOAD it
__label__1 This is one of those games that require you to think outside the box in order to solve its puzzles. It can get frustrating on some levels, just don't give up!! The graphics are decent and the sound is tolerable. But the replayability is one of the highes
__label__1 very good game. there are a ton of levels, and each one takes no more than two minutes, so great distraction that is always near a stopping point. simple concept that can make you think. smooth controls. well done
__label__1 I always love a good puzzle game and this one is pretty well done. The graphics are good and simple enough, music is good, and gameplay is exciting enough. Recommended
__label__1 I've played quite a few levels of InfeCCt, and I find it to be a pretty fun puzzle game.Some of the later levels can get pretty challenging, but they are never frustrating.Overall, a very enjoyable puzzle game for Android.
__label__1 I have the free version of this game with ads and I like it very much. good puzzling wait time boredom buster... nice to have the ad free version... that's good riddance of those annoying ads... but yea... get this game... this is a quality app.
__label__1 this seems to be the perfect game for when you're in the bathroom each level takes about 2 to 5 minutes and is a tremendous amount of fun. all of them are very creative and I feel excellent after figuring out how to solve it
__label__0 Infecct crashed my android. Had to call the phone company to see if they could help me and they could not save my phone from crashing, so had to wipe my phone clean!! Not a good app!
__label__1 I've really enjoyed playing this game. It makes you think and play ahead. I like that I can do each level over and over until I get it right, even if I don't get full points, because the point to me is to solve the puzzle.
__label__1 This game is a fun puzzle game that gets more challenging as you go. Easy to use and understand. Great game
__label__1 Fun puzzle game. If you like a game that requires thinking instead of killing everything on the screen you'll enjoy this game.
__label__1 The first person to truly say that they would not rate there own app(or have friends rate it) can then worry about whether or not the dev rated there game. And that stands across the board, great game nice graphics, solid gameplay, what more do you want 
__label__1 We don't all like the same kind of games. If you like apps that aren't too fast paced and/or frustrating, you'll probably like this. It's actually sort of soothing to play.The game plays well...no glitches, or freezes on my galaxy tab p-1000. I like it.
__label__1 hours of entertainment... totally worth $4... good graphics and good game play! can't wait to see what is next up.
__label__0 this app does not work on the galaxy nexus. It freezes on the screen that has 2 panels. Please fix this.
__label__1 good game to get your brain working. this is my go to game when I have a few minutes to spare. I like that it has multiple profiles and saves you place when you exit.  overall a fun, challenging game!
__label__1 The overall concept of the game seems simple - start at one point, draw a line connecting all squares to a logical endpoint.  And it does have to be to a "logical endpoint," which means a) the game doesn't have a big blinking arrow saying "end line here!
__label__1 The game is somewhat challenging. I'm still in the early stages and I know it will get more difficult. Most complain that they can't go back and improve their score once they know the solution. I'm glad you can't. If it's that big of a deal create a new 
__label__1 great bathroom game, if you gave it less than 3 stars, you obviously lack the mental capabilities to play games like this
__label__0 Does not even load the main page. And that also shows that this is nothing more than a glorified bookmark. Pointless and broken.
__label__0 This app is hard to read on the Kindle Fire HD. Tiny white on black text is unreadable! I sent them feedback; hopefully they will fix that in the future. I look forward to trying this program again. They need to allow us to change the background colors a
__label__0 Whoever made this app didn't even bother to check if it worked before putting it up on the appstore. They obviously don't care either.  Just download the OTHER  TMZ app. It is also free, and IT actually works!!REALLY AWFUL APP!!!
__label__0 I fiound this less then useful for my android tablet. It may work with other devices but it's not for the tablet.
__label__1 First off, I love Adobe Connect. I teach online classes for a living and I think it is great. I have been jealous for months of students with iPads being able to sign into my connect classes from their tablets. Well, now I can do the same from my Android
__label__1 All the features of Adobe Connect on my laptop, but on a tablet.  A great app for a great product.
__label__0 I downloaded this app to my Kindle Fire and realized too late that the Fire already has it.  I just hadn't turned it on.  Bad purchase for me.
__label__1 My little brother loves this app.all these talking tom haters are a bunch of bufoons.when I saw this app was free I downloaded it instantly.
__label__0 I got this app as part of the appstores' free daily download. Normally the apps are amazing.. But it looks like Amazon has run out of good apps to giveaway. Not worth paying for unless you have a child you want to entertain with the phone and have really
__label__1 It's a talking cat, what more do you expect? This Talking Tom Cat is just a fun little app to play around with for the kids. It works great on my phone and makes me laugh.
__label__0 I got this thinking that it would be awesome and fun, but I was way off. You have to talk really loud for the cat to even hear you, and the actions are too minimal and kind of lame.
__label__0 Unfortunately one star is lowest I can give. What a waste of an app.  No real value,  not the slightest bit entertaining except to those who are 2 years old. With Amazon's special offer to get this for free in feel I spent too much.
__label__0 They say it's a good app for children but it's not I let my son play it right they hacked it and asked him like where's your school where's your home and he told them our adress so they might be coming right now so watch your children playing this app.
__label__1 Had this app last year when we went to Montana on AmTrak.  Had a lot of fun with it when kids were around. Some haters on here just don't get it!  Chill!!
__label__0 If talking to inadamint objects is your thing this app is for you. Slightly more entertaining than watching paint dry. How this app is so popular on market is beyond me.
__label__1 My 5 year old love these apps. It does exactly what the review states. Obviously the people who gave this 1 star didn't read the review and don't have kids. You can also try out the free version to see whether or not you want to buy this app.
__label__1 Spent a couple of hours with my Great Granddaughter playing with &#34;Talking Tom:&#34; love it!!!When I visit she looks forward to taling to &#34;TOM&#34;
__label__1 Fun little app to play with. You can upload or save the videos you make. They also have other characters.
__label__1 Grandchild liked the free version so had to have the full version. there was just no reason not to get it, and now even my 8 month old grandbaby likes it. :)
__label__1 My six year old and her friends love this. The first words out of her mouth when we're leaving (and the next twenty) are, &quot;can I have taking tom?&quot; I've had to plug my phone in so she can keep playing. People, if you say that your kids love it, 
__label__0 This game is so boring!  I cannot believe people would sell this for 99&cent;.  This isn't worth at all.  So stupid!  Total rip-off; DO NOT BUY(talking Tom is hazardous to your health LOL).
__label__0 love the app when it was free from google. this paid app only has tom, the google paid app had 3 different animals to choose from.
__label__1 People should stop being so anal when rating this app. Its a kids app, that's why kids love it, so If you think the app is stupid there is the reason, rate the app on what the little kids think, my little sisters love this app
__label__0 All it does is repeat what you say to it with a different voice. You can also punch and slap the cat around. So if you have anger issues or you are 2yrs old then this app might be for you.Not hating on just this app. Any app like this one is just as bad.
__label__1 This is the cutest little guy.  He mimics you and purrs, and a few other cute things.  What a pet, no veterinary bills and no grocery bills.  This little buddy is a great companion anytime.
__label__0 Stupid. Don't waste you're time. This app is not worth a dime. Almost insulting that they charge for this garbage. Not even worth it for free.
__label__1 makes me laugh.  had been wondering about this app for a while.  thanks Amazon .  does what's stated.  works well.  can get annoying but it isn't a game that makes someone want to break their phone in frustration.  good game to make kids laugh.  sat and 
__label__1 Lighten up you old fogeys. It's something for kids, not rocket scientists. Calm down, breath and read the description. The application does what out promises, nothing more, nothing less. Wow...
__label__0 No wonder if was popular on iPhone, goes to prove the point that iPhones are popular among kids,  soccer moms and celebutards.  This app is for the under 5 crowd or mental equivalent. I'd be upset if I had paid for it.
__label__1 This is not going to engage an adult,  but I don't think that's the design of this application. The reviews on Amazon were livid, enough so that I temporarily agreed in solidarity to not download such a terrible title on FAotD. However I remember seeing 
__label__0 it's not even remotely entertaining.  it does very little and there's no variety.  just the same lame thing over and over again. lame, lame, lame.
__label__1 This app is good clean fun. love the copy cat feature. great fun for all ages. people that left negative reviews need to lighten up and live life a little.
__label__1 works great on my droid x. very simple app. glad it was free today. it repeats what you say amd does a few other things like fall fown when you punch him and purr when you pet him.
__label__0 This app us stupid. Piss poor graphics, no real entertainment value, takes up space that could be better utilized for other things, and that's just on the outside... Very limited on interactions with the &quot;cat&quot;, recording is spotty at best, and 
__label__1 This game is hours of fun for my 3 year old son.  He loves this app! He's a big fan of hitting the cat,  and the bird that bites him.
__label__0 Stupid.  Girls And boys hate This app.  HE does not repeat whatI say.  HE does nothing.  If I could give This app less then 1 star I would.  I hate Talking Tom.
__label__1 Before you rate this app, make sure to use it for a few weeks first. It has garnered many laughs from a lot of people, not including my children. The kids will love it! If you have kids under 10 years old they will get a big kick from it. I was lucky eno
__label__1 I don't think this app deserves all of the negative reviews it has received. It's a simple app that keeps my son entertained for quite a while. It would be nice to have a few more options of what the cat does, but it's still a fun little app.
__label__1 It's hoot.  Cat's Meow!  Hours and hours of fun and entertainment!  Amuse your friends and relatives and strangers too. A msut have to go along with talking puppy.
__label__1 This is a fun app, even got me to laugh a couple times. How can this have 4.5 stars in the market but only 2 here? Come on people, this app deserves more than that.
__label__0 This application will not install on my motorola Atrix for some reason. I tried to download it a few times, I even tried to clear up memory on the phone but I still get the same error. &quot;this application did not install&quot;
__label__1 At first, I thought this would be an app enjoyed most by a young audience. Much to my surprise, I am finding adults are having as much, if not more, fun with Tom's antics as children do. This app is fun for all and brings many a smile and quite a few chu
__label__0 If all this cat does is repeat back what you say to it, why would the app need read/write  access to my SD card, phone records, have full internet access, and more?
__label__0 The 'My Talking Tom' game gives more to offer, and you always have something new to look forward to. This game gives nothing but a voice emulator that doesn't work unless your device has a recorder. In addition, the graphics are just freaky and unappeali
__label__0 I don't see how punching a cat in the face is funny. I would never pay for this apps I just checked it out since it was free. only small children would find this app funny.
__label__1 According to some reviewers I don't know how to raise my kids because I let them have a little fun with this app.  Damn, there goes my father of the year award!  It really is only a 3 star app, but you know... 5 stars for justice.
__label__0 how is this such a popular application on android market and now a deal of the day on Amazon? I have gotten some great apps on amazons deal of the day and will certainly buy apps later from a number of those developers but this is just a waste of space, 
__label__1 Have had this for months. Kids love it. You get from this what you expect. It is a toy.  There are some annoying bits, but there are in all apps.  Oh, you can turn the violence off also, which is what we do.Lots of hate in these reviews. If you want real
__label__0 This takes up 16 megs of space and is not fun, has no point and is basically just a handful of repetitive animations.  Avoid. An app this shoddy is probably just a Trojan for harvesting your Facebook data.
__label__1 I am an adult ? :-)  Just find this funny and in this busy, crazy world we live in - I get away from it all and relax for the moment.  Makes me smile.  Maybe you have to be a cat lover but I don't think so.  Can I say try it - you will like it. What have
__label__1 OMG!!!!! You have got to get this app!! It is totally awesome and fun for children!!  My 6 year old boy loves it!  You can record messages and play them (ie: Happy Birthday) and the cat in his cute cartoon voice, says it back!! AWESOME! :)
__label__0 I don't understand why anyone would buy this app.  It's almost a waste of my phone's memory. Poke and speak to the cat which will repeat in an odd voice. Fun for 10 seconds.
__label__1 Anyone who thinks this is a pointless app obviously does not have a 4 year old. My son loves this and laughs hysterically at it. It gets old after awhile but is worth it while it lasts. Of all the talking-something apps, this one is the best. Large file 
__label__1 And I can't stop laughing. Totally adorable and I can't get my phone back down everyone wants to play with it.To those who hate on this where is your sense of humor?
__label__0 the fart works, but it does not repeat anything i say.  sucks real bad.  deleted 5 minutes after downloading the free paid version.not worth it for free, so do not buy.
__label__0 I really don't understand the point of this app. For something that costs money it should have a lot more functionality. There's a definite lack of creativity.
__label__1 What's up with all the haters? Can't read the description and not download? All of the entitled snowflakes who want to complain about something meant for toddlers and then complain when it can't figure out einsteins theory..  Maybe you should be complain
__label__0 I dislike this app for kids due to the fact that Tom does some disgusting things - sure older kids love the fact that you can beat up the cat, but I find it inappropriate for my children.
__label__1 This  is entertaining, lots of fun for the grandkids.  They really like it.  He is cute and funny.  Love him.
__label__0 For a paid version, there are a lot of permissions that look like an ad-based version. And they are not explained. Free or not, this is a lose and uninstall. Now I just need Amazon to forget I ever looked at this application.
__label__1 This app is great fun! It's greatly entertaining and makes me laugh all the time. I give two thumbs up! AAAA!!!!++++++!!!!
__label__1 Tom the Talking cat he is very cool my grandkids love playing with him and the things he can do
__label__0 I didn't even bother to download this app because the reviews were so poor. Come on Amazon. I look forward to the free apps you're offering and now I have to wait another day for the next one which will hopefully not let me down like this one. Thanks.
__label__0 Many people are telling those how rate this app poorly to lighten up. But childish and immature attempts humor aside, the graphics on this are terrible. Its a 3d model prerendered to a series of videos that initiate when clicked.This method helps it run 
__label__1 No ads and although lacking in content,  keeps the kids entertained. Given the amour of time this has been on the market,  it not surprisingly works without lag or problems on my sgs vibrant.
__label__1 Talking Tom,Liked so much,I'm thinking of collecting all the &#34;talkers&#34;. Really great when you need a little &#34;pickup&#34; on a down day.
__label__1 One of the first apps I dl for my phone!  This app is awesome!  No,  I would not have made it a free app of the day but this is funny as heck! Stop ur hating!  Talking Tom rules!
__label__0 yes this app doesn't really worth a penny and I don't know why there is over 250k people downloaded it on android market. what is the point of having some more animation with this paid version?
__label__1 My kids have loved Tom and many of his friends who have similar apps for months. I think a lot of the negative reviews are coming from people who are upset that the free app of the day is targeted towards little kids. It's not the app's fault that Amazon
__label__0 not for me
__label__1 Why Don't you post what the update is for every app I have there's an update tab when it needs to be updated but it never says what the update is, why don't you put a tab on there to show what the update is
__label__0 I dont get it, one app i had dowload, requires this adobe air, but wess wat, it does not soported by the software of the kindle... i realy dont understand, hope you have better expirence of this
__label__0 I have found it very annoying to find so many Android products likeAdobe AIRthat are not compatible with Kindle, even though the Kindle can run a large number of Android apps.  It would be VERY helpful if you (Amazon) would take the time to CLEARLY state
__label__0 Therefore I can't play any of the games that require it on my new tablet. I'll fix the rating when there's support updates.
__label__0 Wont download.  Not only that I cant get rid of that annoying Amazon icon at the top of the screen.  I have tried just about everything to either download it or get rid of it including clearing the ram.  It disappears then the next time I look its back a
__label__0 like i said, won't open. i wasted money on an app that needs this to work properly and it doesn't work.
__label__1 Most negative reviews are based of anti-flash, Steve job worshipping blogs. AIR allows developers to distribute their app on multiple devices such as Android, iOS, Desktop and TV. This not lazy but efficient development.
__label__1 What can you say about Adobe Air except that it is required to view some things and I had to download it.
__label__1 Adobe Air is not really an app but, rather, an operating environment kinda like Flash or Java or a number of different requirements. It does what it is supposed to do: allow Air apps to operate on your Android.  Cool!!
__label__1 Works very well with Huawei Ascend II. Adobe is a well recognized name & always delivers top quality products that you can depend on. Very satisfied.
__label__0 I just deleted this once I got it.  Did not like it or understand it also.  It is up to you to decide what you want to do with it.
__label__1 Why are people hating on Adobe?  I'd like to see more use of AIR.  It does it's job, just like JRE.  iPhone users are just jealous...
__label__1 I like adobe and have used it many times. It's good for so many of the apps you have installed.  It loaded great for me and you definitely need it.
__label__0 I have this on my phone because other apps won't work without it... and why is *that* again? The app does nothing, on it's own, but consume valuable space.
__label__0 I am uninstalling this app. Adobe wants to not support flash for Android 4.0. That is fine. I will not support Adobe. I have a un-rooted Motorola Xoom running Jelly Bean and the Samsung Galaxy S3 which is running ICS. I can't view any websites that have 
__label__1 in order to play some games and apps I had to download this add-on it works doesn't lock up my phone, and I guess it just does what it needs to do.
__label__1 I have Adobe Air on my pc at home and my tablet.  It has never crashed on me but keeps things running smooth.
__label__0 I have tried several times to install/reinstall this app on my Cruz T301 tablet...it will download, but will not install.  Have used chat and verbal assistance with Amazon staffers to no avail.  Was able to download some apps from Applanet that are not d
__label__0 Doesn't work. Keeps telling me, sorry the app store has closed. Tried u install and re-installed. Didn't work. But it is making the puzzle games i d/l it for, work.
__label__0 As soon as I installed it on my phone all my other apps starting acting buggy. I'm not sure what this app does but I thought it would make my Flash dependent apps work better. No so! I uninstalled very quickly to restore the stableness of my phone.
__label__0 This app would not function properly on my Ainol Novo 7 tablet with Android 4.01 (Ice Cream Sandwich). I know the ranking of this particular company's software would have made it nice to have been able to install. Time will get them there.
__label__1 I find this one of many applications that are needed to play and run your games and apps, both on my tablet and my computers.
__label__0 Take Note:  If you own an LG Optimus V, this app will not install even if it says it is compatible on the product page.  I was very disappointed.  You would think this would have been ironed out by now.
__label__1 The wife couldn't figure this out at first but it's an easy download (in my opinion) and was required to view her books. She loves it now.
__label__0 Unfortunately, this app is not compatible with the Kindle Fire. What's worse is that, instead of explaining why it is not compatible, you are not even able to view any system requirements that Adobe AIR needs to run. Also, the 3.5 Beta does not complete 
__label__0 any app that does not work on my phone gets a one star rating, make this app compatible with optimus. I hate apps that are incompatible with my phone
__label__1 What company in their right mind wants to pay multiple times to have their apps developed on multiple native platforms. When they can write their sin Flex/Flash once and have them run on all the platforms. Let Adobe do the work of figuring out all the di
__label__1 JUST GOT THIS 2COMBINE WITH OTHER APP,BUT WAS PLEASANTLY SURPRISED WITH HOW GREAT IT WORKS! KEEP UP THE GREAT WORK!
__label__1 Makes apps that use it smaller and a faster download. I wish more apps used this, so my internal storage would be smaller!
__label__1 From what I understand, this is sort of an operating system.  I had to install this before another Android app would work.  I've not had any problems with it.
__label__0 I understand the benefits of developing apps with air from a developer's standpoint, but on a mobile device with limited space, it's ridiculous to require users to eat up extra storage so you can be lazy enough to not code a native version of your app.
__label__1 I did not order this item from here.  I have no experience with it but I need to get it off my Reviews page so I'm writing this review.  I don't know what this item does, but maybe I need it for my iPhone?
__label__1 Be it flash or PDF or anything adobe this app brings it to your Android device. You need this so Get it
__label__0 Does not work.  Won't open.  Have apps that say you have to have this app too but it does not work.  If you require this for another app to work just delete the app.
__label__0 Hey All,Just a note that this app cannot install on a Velocity Micro T-301.Cheers!Dave Cooke
__label__0 Will not load on my kindle hdx and it is required for one of the games I loaded. I cannot play a game I paid for due to this problem.
__label__0 I cannot use this on my kindle fire.  I purchased the New York times Crossword Puzzle and I can't use it as it requires adobe air and it won't work with my kindle fire.  I am very disappointed.
__label__1 Had a lot of fun playing games with this app. It helped me with my games. Great, great, great app.
__label__1 As always Adobe works great, easy to use. Havent had any problems at all. Thanks .. What else can I say ?
__label__1 I love this app it makes possible for two of my other apps to word flawlessly. Trouble without it. thanks.
__label__0 ok i like adobe and i whont to get this for my kindle fire hd so amazon needs to get to it so i can get it
__label__1 Great app! Needed it to run my Flames Live wallpaper. It worked for that. Not sure what else it is helping, but it got the Flames going!
__label__0 If I understood this, I would probably give it a four.  With some purchases, you need to be very cautious.
__label__1 performs beautifully on both my HTC Thunderbolt and Motorola Xoom. Adobe is consistently updating the framework to add features. It&apos;s one of the options that makes Android openness superior to Apple&apos;s closed, pay for everything system.
__label__1 I utilze this icon on a constant basis. I would definitely be lost without it. It has proving to be very beneficial and useful at the same time. It have me to be able to processed and use things effectively.
__label__0 Adobe AIR is a pain in the butt. A necessary evil sometimes. But not what I would like to have installed.
__label__0 I have no use for it even though it says I do. What exactly does it do on Coby Tablet? I haven't been able to find out why it doesn't work. I will delete it very soon. Please find out how it helps the mobile equipment work.
__label__1 All you iSheep flash haters out there quit complaining about it burning battery life.  Update your 1.0 install to the latest version that uses hardware acceleration, and battery life issues go away. Or you can sit around and complain about it (for anothe
__label__1 I would recommend Adobe products as I find them to be most useful and do the things I need to do.
__label__1 works very well, gives access to all sorts of stuff. I've used this on all my phones/tablets since it became available. there are many reasons not to buy inferior LG or other low end hardware, this is one of them.
__label__0 Another bloated and insecure piece of software from Adobe. It's huge. The performance was lackluster. Fortunately I can remove this Post completely. I wish the same was true of Flash.
__label__1 need this to play certain games and other systems. It works pretty good and takes no time to download for use.
__label__0 would not down load so I did not like it at all it sucks a lot and i am out of words
__label__0 This uses Flash, which performs terribly, is insecure and chews through the batteries. It&apos;s only used by lazy developers anyway so send them a message by using native apps.
__label__1 all Adobe products have been great for me. as usual its works great. I have been an Adobe user sense its launch, best way to download and transfer large files.
__label__0 Don't bother if you're using Virgin Mobile's LG Optimus V, it will not install. Adobe seems lost, the app is a hefty 16mb but does not work on all Android smartphones. Brute force programming, obviously.
__label__0 I couldn't use it on my android for some reason.... For some reason my android was so stubborn on what I could use on that stupid thing....
__label__0 I would not have bothered downloading this application, but it was required for an application I purchased with real money. I wouldn't be so bothered if I could recieve a refund or if their existed a work around that wouldn't void my warranty, but as it 
__label__1 definately worth getting if you are into flash. you guys with cheap optimus v phones need to stop complaining that your phones cant do anything. rate the app... not your cheap throw away phones
__label__1 Good for my Kindle Fire to view PDFs on them and hey its Adobe how could you go wrong!  Didn't take up much space and a clean install.
__label__1 I don't use this app at all, but my grandson loves it and plays with it quite often. Was thinking about deleting but he plays with it too often.
__label__1 I downloaded this talking cat because it was a free app. Although silly, most people can't get enough of him. My 5 year old Granddaughter had fun with it for about a half hour, and people I work with get a great laugh when touching his tail for feet. Thi
__label__0 When I downloaded this app all you could do is pet the cat and hit the cat it didn't do any of the other things it was meant to do.
__label__1 Once again my grandson LOVES this one!  He could not wait to show this one to his daddy! when my grandson laughs it is magical with this it is often!
__label__1 This is actually a hit with my kids. I bought tablets for my 10 year old son, 7 year old son, and 2 year old daughter for Christmas, and this is one of the things I pre-loaded prior to opening Christmas morning. It was adorable watching them play with it
__label__0 I cast my vote for one of the most useless Apps for 2011!  The quickest app that I have uninstalled from my device for being a waste of time downloading and space on my device.  Did I mention this is a useless app?  1 star as there is nothing lower to gi
__label__0 My boy friend downloaded this for the kids and all the kids do is slap the cat until his falls. qnd the noise gets so annoying geez!
__label__0 I downloaded this app so I could play with it with my young niece and nephew. Once I opened it, I quickly realized that in order to use the app, add-ons had to be purchase. Not cool.
__label__1 This game is so cute and fun I love singing into it and playing. I also have found my cats love it when I meow into it and then he mocks it back. They will come running to where I am. Great idea! 5 stars. No flaws really for what it is.
__label__1 I think this is so cute and perfect for stress relieve! It is adorable. Everyone loves playing with this and the voice is super sweet!
__label__1 Ok I was putting my kindle next to the speaker of my Tv then Tom started to repeat what the characters in CHOWDER are saying
__label__1 But he can be a pain, I don't know who's schedule he is on but it is not mine. Really cute and fun to play with. Getting the points was kind of hard till I got someone to show me to press on everything and I do mean everything.
__label__1 this one kept my grandchildren ages 4, 2 and 1 entertained for about an hour and us all laughing when he talked back at us.
__label__1 I love knocking the cat down and making it say funny things, and recording them for later. I think you would like it too.
__label__1 Fun & silly.  Good when you need a laugh.  Very cute and a good way to make someone laugh when they need a good laugh.
__label__0 This is the old version of Talking Tom! You need to put on all of the other talking friends apps on the Amazon App Store. For example Talking Tom 2, or Talking Been, or Tom & Been News. Thoes are my favorite apps on my mom's iPad, but I want them on my K
__label__1 This is a fun app for kids, if you want to hear them laugh from the bottom if their hummus, this is the app!
__label__1 we love the cute graphics and the way it imitates.the next one w/ the iphone is even cuter - they go back and forth!!
__label__1 My 5 and 3 year old kid loves this app. They love hearing Tom repeats everything they say and copy their laughs as they play with this app. It is a good time killer for the kids.
__label__1 Had to buy the full version because my grand daughter loved this one so much. it's a must have here.
__label__1 YOU WILL LOVE THIS APP.  SO MUCH FUN YOU WILL LAUGH ALL DAY LONG.  BIG FUN YOUNG AND OLD. BIG FUN.
__label__0 my nephew downloaded this game He played around with it for a while but I felt the image a bit too weird to tolerate it.  a cyber pet.. Hell no.
__label__1 I got this for my 3& 1/2 yr old granddaughter and she absolutely LOVES it!!! She loves these types of things on the Kindle.
__label__1 oh yeah--lot of fun creating your own messages to people and having to act out and record in his voice what you say. then email to friends for them to enjoy.  a must have for tablet or mobile. hilarious what you can get this cat to do and say.
__label__1 Got this for my grand son and what surprise when it began to talk .  He had no idea that it would do that .  Laughed and Laughed
__label__1 I just love this app...... puts a smile on your face because it is so crazy, my grandson just LOVES IT!!!!!
__label__0 Stupid game. Waste of time. Wish would never down loaded it. absolutely the worst I ever down loaded What were you thinking?
__label__1 I can trust time more then I can trust any of my other friends. He does not ask to borrow money and not pay it back. He does not borrow things and not bring it back. Last but not least he won't talk shut about you behind your back
__label__1 My youngest daughter absolutely loves this!!!  Keeps her occupied for a really long time.  It's funny listening to this and the kids will certainly be entertained.
__label__1 My great granddaughter learned to call her grandmother Me Maw , I kept repeating it to Tom and she would smile and say it after he did .
__label__1 A lot of laughs.  I love his little face, so expressive.  Kids love this app and it is free, a big plus!
__label__0 I afraid this product didn't work for me. I tried it multiple times, but ended up uninstalling it. I hope others have better luck!
__label__0 It seems that anytime I order an app online with Amazon, I never receive them in the cloud as promised.  Talking Tom Cat is one of those apps.  When I search for the app on my kindle, it is not available.  Fortunately, it's free.
__label__1 Talking tom is one of the highlight of my day and I love when whenever I say something he says it in a much higher pitch
__label__0 It doesn't work but if it did it would still be dumb. Did not like at all don't buy !!!!!!
__label__0 I bought this app, thinking it would be fun but really, it just makes u buy stuff to do &#34;funner&#34; things with Tom...
__label__1 I got this app for my son who as soon has it on his iPod.  Their actions are funny and cute!
__label__0 This will NOT work on a Kindle Fire!  The Kindle Fire doesn't have a Microphone, therefore you can't talk to Tom, which means he can't repeat anything you say!  It would have been nice if Amazon had mentioned that this game is only for Cellphones (with M
__label__0 This is definitely for pre-school age kids. It is so silly that I am sure the little folks will giggle. For anyone age seven and above, I think they will find it pure silliness. However it was free and easy to delete.
__label__1 This app is great for keeping your grandchildren entertained for short periods of time, especially when they are 2 years old.
__label__0 Do not get this app. It is really bad for children! I showed this to my daughter thinking she would like this but later that night she told me that she was having nightmares about it! I would give it zero stars if I could because this ruined my poor daug
__label__1 my daughter loves this game it is alot of fun, and I enjoy it too! Thank you, it is funny as well.
__label__1 Please get this game please it is a really good game(I got this for my kids I have 3 all 3 love it get it) if my picky kids like in so well yours.If you do like this game look for the other talking Tom apps
__label__0 It's a good thing that this app was free because I had zero guilt in removing it from my Kindle Fire HD. It froze and force closed from the get go and the voice creeped out my little girl ( and me too, for that matter). Just weird and non-functional and 
__label__1 I like to play with this app and my kids do to.Great fun for the price and hey I haven't deleted it so it must be good enough.
__label__0 i thought this would be fun, but i could not get him to do what the description said he would do, and it was just dumb.
__label__1 My children love this app, the kids interact with the cat. You can feed the cat milk, it purrs when petted, you can hit it on the head, and it falls over. The cat listens and mimics what you say, my children think it is hilarious.
__label__1 This is something we had to get. Saw it on my sister's ipad a few years ago, and luckily it works the same way on my son's new Kindle.
__label__0 This game is a waste! I thought that it would be fun cause my friend has this app and it was so fun! But this game is not for any kindle! First of all....it does t even repeat what I say! And when I try to do an action I apparently have to pay for more f
__label__0 There is a new hacker and Tom says where do up live and he records your every move. Stay safe and don't get this app and if you have kids who play it DELETE IT NOW!!!
__label__0 .... weird. It wants me to buy Stuff. Don't get this app unless you want to buy things for 99 cents like food.  The only things you can do is Give Tom milk and a few more boreing things.  Sweat talking puppy funny dog is way better.  I give this app 1 st
__label__0 doe snot work well with all products...can be a real prob if you dont know that. works good on phone and stuff...not so much on my tablet
__label__0 My husband has this app on his I-phone, and we both really like it.  So, when I saw I could get the same app for my kindle Fire HD, I was thrilled....only to be disappointed majorly!  I found the app's pictures to be blurry, and I don't think it really w
__label__0 I've played this before on my phone but it wouldnt work on my Kindle. I'm sure I done it right. Wished it worked,
__label__1 THIS IS AWESOME IT IS THE BEST GAME IN THE WHOLE TIRE WORLD OH MY GODNESS BABY 'M NNN MMMMMMMJDJD

__label__1 Brought this out at a party for my kids, and it was a HIT!  The kids all loved it!  Recommended for kids!!
__label__0 I downloaded this for my grandkids and thought it would be fun for them. But frankly, I found it difficult to figure out and when I did get some response from it, it was just plain dumb. I wouldn't waste the memory space on my Kindle with this.
__label__0 If you like someone repeating everyone of your words, or thoughts. How about a talking animated character doing it. Why not. Why not fill the quiet times with, an animated talking fat alley walking, lack of dignity, cat. What could be more fun out on a d
__label__1 My grandkids just love slapping this poor cat and instead of crying for my phone and running the battery down I let them have the kindle until they get tired or the cat just doesn't get back up.  LOL
__label__0 My kids convinced me to let them download this app and we were very disappointed. It doesn't offer anything unless you choose to pay for additional options. I will be removing this app.
__label__1 What a cute sad little face.  However, it is fun to play with little kitty during a break at work. If you give it a name the fun is even greater.
__label__1 even the free version is really cute and the kids enjoy it. i purchased the full version since my kids enjoy the free version so much. fun and worth it
__label__1 If you're having a bad day, just fire up Tom and he'll have you laughing again. I love his sqeaky voice and being able to record the videos and upload them to fb or send them via email. If you try to talk too fast it doesn't grab all of the words. My dau
__label__1 Laughter is the best medicine and it makes me laugh when he repeats my words.  Sometimes he might miss some though.
__label__0 you need to download so many different things to play this game its not that great really you r wasting your time with this one
__label__1 who could ask for more?  This is a silly app and I don't really understand it but everyone in my house thinks it's so funny.  I see everyone (including the adults) playing with it.
__label__0 This might entertain a three year old for a few minutes but even that's pushing it. The 'free' version is crippled beyond belief.  You're expected to pay for almost every feature. Don't waste your time.
__label__1 I love when u talk to him and he's like a translator so please please please buy talking Tom the cat
__label__1 this is kinda funny to play with. what more can be said download it play it if you don't like it erase it (got to love free things)
__label__1 My granddaughter loves this cat. We play together, wish there was more free stuff that you don't have to buy in order to get things for Tom cat.... :(
__label__0 DON'T LIKE IT AT ALL, IT ONLY DOES A FEW THINGS IF YOU WANT MORE YOU HAVE TO PAY FOR IT
__label__0 There aren't enough nice things that you can do with this cat. You can make it purr a little but mostly its geared toward punching and hurting the cat. The interaction is too violent and promotes laughing at hurting an animal. Disgusting.
__label__0 I got this app thinking that it would be fun,but Tom wouldn't repeat anything! Pointless putting it on the Amazon store if it doesn't work for kindle!
__label__0 This was a horrible app for the kindle Fire!it froze up my kindle Fire  and he would not even talk!if u r looking for this app for the kindle Fire,don't buy it!
__label__1 My great niece loves Tom....not as much as Ben...I don't know why....kids. they like what they like and that's all it is.
__label__1 Fun for the whole family.It's a fun App, love the copy cat voice, the kids love playing with it
__label__1 I love this game it is so fun I luv making it fall down its so funny Andy some people think that it's a wast of time but it's not it is awesome for kids my whole family Luca it (Thanks Tom)
__label__0 Just a way to sell you add-ons. I suppose it could be considered cute, (Ben the dog is better)But it is a thinly disguised vending machine for in-app purchases.
__label__1 This is so much fun the whole family can enjoy. The kids get the most out of it when he repeats what they say.
__label__1 I love my talking Tom cat. My son has it & i found it very funny. Lots of laughs & lots of fun!
__label__1 I love this cat! He has the cutest voice! I use this app to wake my son up in the morning. Just talk into your kindle and tom repeats whatever u say but in a way cuter voice.
__label__0 This application was very laggy and very slow. The cat would move it's mouth with a delay of a few seconds for any words.
__label__1 I play this with my grandkids and I don.t know who enjoys it more! It just makes you laugh. There is no thinking required.
__label__1 This is such a cute app.  I could hardly get my phone out of my grandson's hands because he had so much fun with it.  It's fun for adults too.
__label__0 This  app  is  the  worst  I've  ever  downloaded  it  stinks. It  is  so  boring  all  you  can  do is  tap  things.
__label__0 Doesn't work that great on my Kindle fire. What a bummer as my young kids get a laugh out of it.
__label__1 When u need to break tension or make the kids laugh this is great, really like it when children smile and laugh
__label__1 Tom cat is very funny & entertaining. You will keep the attention of any crowd. This can be used for all ages.
__label__1 Talking Tom is better than the other apps. He's been a brilliant idea of a game. This free download has  hilarious cat.
__label__0 Not worth the time loading....can't do anything but make the cat purr and knock him out. I would recommend you pay for this one so he will do more than two things. I was disappointed.
__label__0 I have seen other people have this and it's as funny as can be.. but it didn't work on my KindleFire HD.. nothing! at least it was free.
__label__1 It's great what I really like is how you can make videos and upload it to anything I uploaded my first one
__label__1 I love the app but I am not sure if I like the original one or the 2nd one! So please comment me on witch one you think is better!
__label__0 TALKING TOM WILL NOT DOWNLOAD ON MY KINDLE FIRE DEVICE. MY DAUGHTER HAS IT ON HER I PHONE AND I THOUGHT IT TO BE VERY FUNNY.
__label__0 it works on my kindle fire but it DOES NOT FREAKING TALK TO ME!talking ginger is better. U HAVE TO BUY STUFF TO HAVE MORE FUNthis app sucks so much!!!!!!!!!!do not download!!!!!
__label__0 doesn't do that much...amusing for the first minute or so.  I will probably delete this app in another week or so.
__label__1 My kid still plays with this app from time to time. She loves the noises reactions, and the way Tom Cat repeats everything she says. Great app for kids.
__label__1 So funny, we love it all of us do.  This little cat is so funny! We tell everyone about this funny tom cat all of us play with this cat all the time!
__label__0 GAME NEVER WORKED CORRECTLY ON MY D2 PAD.  HAD TO DELETE IT... ... ... .... ... .... ... ... ...
__label__1 My grand children love this app and play it a lot. I am very happy with it would recommend it.
__label__0 When I talk to Tom he just sits there doing nothing not good for the kindle fire THIS APP SUCKS
__label__1 Just a fun app to play around with and pass time - it is just fun and funny-I like it
__label__1 Fun and cute for my daughter! Good for young ages! I believe K thru 2nd graders would love this Tom Cat!
__label__1 Always fun to go back to this guy once in awhile.  Him and his friend apps are always there for a silly laugh with friends from time to time.
__label__1 My two year old loves this! It doesn't get old for her and we share lots of laughs over it. It does just what is described. She loves knocking the cat down. It is helping her learn to talk as well!
__label__1 It's fun, grandkids love it.  He s cute, like all the different things he does.  Entertaining and they get a good laugh out of him.
__label__1 This app is for my granddaughter and she loves to play with and really make her laugh when she is playing with it.
__label__1 it's very fun and good. super fun to record and play with when bored. this is super great love it!!
__label__1 It is so much fun to see this cat talking and complaining when you touch it is great.  It gives the impression that is real.
__label__0 I have an iPhone and loaded the talking Dodo bird on it because my 3 year old lives it. I got tired of him constantly getting my phone, so I bought him an Android Tablet for Christmas so he had his own device and could play with it anytime he wanted. Yes
__label__0 This download was the worst one yet. What on Earth is the fun in tapping a screen to punch a cat? Sure, I hate cats, too, but someone spent time on this? Try turning the hatred towards pesky felines into something more productive. &quot;Cat Drop Soup&quo
__label__0 Amazon should mention that this app will not talk on the Kindle Fire.  I looked like an idiot talking to my Kindle expecting a response.  I will be deleting this app.
__label__0 Most annoying app ever.  I can't believe I actually even downloaded this.  As soon as I opened it and used it once I deleted it.
__label__1 It is hilarious!  My grandkids and nieces love it! Very entertaining!I would recommend this app to anyone with small or not so small kids!
__label__0 Said I'd have to reload, but we were able to get Tom 2 instead. I'm not sure if the reason it didn't load is my fault or not.
__label__1 Enjoy myself and great for grandchildren who thoroughly enjoy it!
__label__0 When we're talking about this game, anything is better! I downloaded it for my daughter. I failed to see any warning sign that this would be a depressive game that requires you to torture the animal to get responses. I found it cruel and hateful. I wasn'
__label__1 This app works great!  I use it to entertain my three yr old.  He loves it!  He has even figured out how to make videos with it.
__label__0 I didn't feel it was appropriate for my children. Some of the things were ok but others werent. I have deleted it.
__label__1 this app is cute and funny. all my friend's laugh and thought it was cute. it's a good conversation app to get.
__label__1 How cute this is.  This cat talks to you and he is funny.  He purrs and does all kind of funny things.  Nice when you need a cute laugh.  Easy to operate and has a kids mode and adult mode.
__label__1 Love showing my friends and family this app. Just like me they all got a kick out of it. Especially when I came across buying a lifelike talking Tom through Avon, as an Avon rep.
__label__1 I just got the Talking Tom Cat app.  This is the cutest little cat and when he repeats what I said to him, my real life cats come running over if I say their name and then he repeats it!
__label__1 what can I say....another talking adorable animal and this one is my favorite for sure...You talk and he repeats what you say in a funny voice...he's HILARIUS...My favorite..
__label__1 fun for the whole family. The cat repeats everything you say and the hubby & kids have a blast with this app
__label__1 I think it's great so much fun. My mom has it on her phone too. I have so much fun on it. It is fun for everyone.
__label__1 Bests kids app ever a little annoying but F-U-N fun you need to buy this app I love it tom ( the cat ) is so funny he says what you say you can step on his toe punch him pull his tail and much much more he makes me LOL best:)
__label__1 I'm an animal lover so I love this app because it sends little messages at top of the phone like &#34; hey come play with me&#34; lol but it's boring at times . I wish they could make it where Tom does more than being in the house
__label__1 this app is too funny. having lots of fun with it and other people. everyone needs to laugh. buy this app for some laughs.
__label__1 This game is entertaining! My cousin (2 yrs old) loves to play it and is obsessed with the kitty :3 good for kids and up.
__label__1 This is my favorite app to use for navigating and editing files on my Android phone. I highly recommend this app to anyone who appreciates good utilities made with integrity. I have not found 1 bug while heavily using this app for many years.
__label__1 This is certainly the gold standard for an effective app.  The UI is not beautiful, but it is not clunky and cluttered either.If the dev was aiming for an uber-functional and flawless app that simply does what it should and does it perfectly, he hit his 
__label__1 This handy app really gets to the Root of the issue especially if you have bloated apps that take up valuable resource and space. Bear in mind you do need to be Root to benefit from this app!
__label__1 Excellent file manager app! Even the free version is great, and all you need if not rooted!
__label__1 Must have, only way to truly customize your phone and use all of the accessible storage space on the internal memory.Best money I hand spent on a app
__label__1 very good so much
__label__1 Awesome app. I use it a lot. Root is very useful and this app can be used for so many things. Even if u aren't rooted yet this is a good file manager to use. In most cases you can browse the root of your phone and even copy from but not delete the files 
__label__1 This is the very best root file manager with a very clean ui and tons of essential features, i would recommend this app to anyone. I also recommend getting this devs app &quot;SQLite&quot;, its another must have app:)
__label__0 How can you rate something that won't download!!won' t even let you rate it  I want my money back! what else do I have to say expect that it does not even rate one star if you can't even down load it. oh did i say i tried about twenty times over the cour
__label__1 Very versatile and fast - the best for Android I've seen so far. A strong recommendation for gettings this app if your device is rooted and you need a solid file manager.
__label__1 This is the best application for navigating, modifying, and organizing your rooted Android device. Solid performance with a familiar interface.
__label__1 If you want access to the file system on your android device this is it.  I am using it on my kindle and it is awesome.
__label__1 I have this tool on both my Nook Color &amp; Galaxy Tab.  You need this for all those little tweets to keep your rooted device running smooth.  I found that there is a small learning curve, but once learned you can&apos;t live without it.
__label__1 I needed this to install the supposedly pre-installed Google Store/Google Play that my tablet shipped with.  Works well and has yet to disappoint.
__label__1 Having this app already, I must say that this app should come with every Android phone. Easy to use interface and straight to the point. 5/5 stars!
__label__1 Anyone with a rooted phone will find this is the most awesome file manager out there. You can even see and edit the contents of a database file. Keep up the good work!
__label__1 I use this on my Kindle to get around Amazon's stupid restrictions. It works really great and has allowed me to access the Google Play Store and actually get some good apps (unlike Amazon's... yikes).
__label__1 Most useful app I've purchased so far. If you want to get the most out of your Android phone then this is a must have after you obtain root for your phone. Simple and intuitive to use. Thanks to the dev for putting this up on Amazon. Saves us Google Apps
__label__1 A must have for root users, AND for those who choose not to root as well. By far the very best file explorer! More options and flexibility than all others available, and I have tried them all over the last 6 years of using and rooting Android phones and 
__label__0 I read the info and its said it worked with my android Samsung phone.however it doesn't!tech support says call my cell phone provider, they say call amazon...yadda yadda.do not recommend!
__label__1 I recently acquired this app, and find i can't do without it, if only for the write capability into system files...but i have a specific reason for writing this review.In this review thread, i'm noticing a lot of friction concerning the speed of, or the 
__label__1 I cannot recommend this enough.  It simplifies file organization with powerful features that make having a rooted phone worthwhile.That said, I can also recommend this to users who have not taken the root plunge, as a phenomenal file explorer.  A steal f
__label__0 I guess it's for a more experienced user, but I couldn't figure out how to even make the drop box work.  I deleted the app after some frustration.
__label__0 I'm sorry, but I think this app is leaving out the part ROOT which is in its stupid NAME!!!! At least I THINK that rooting isn't possible on this app, but personally, I think you need to be rocket scientist to figure out how yo work this app.Well, that's
__label__1 This is a very good file manager. This is probably one of a kind wrt handling of viewing and editing DB entries directly.
__label__1 I used this to help move files from my computer to my bionic. I ran into some problems after uninstalling yahoo from my phone, which I found is required for contacts to work. I used root explorer to help put those files back where I needed them to be. Ph
__label__0 I installed this app specifically because it supports Google drive but none of my files populate. Drop box works fine but Google drive Stays blank. Very disappointed.
__label__1 This is easily one of my favorite Apps on my phone, I use it just about every day, I don&apos;t know what I would do without it...
__label__1 This may not be the best UI file manager, but when I try other tools I always come back. I've used it forever across different devices and several versions of Android OS. It always worked well, and had the fleibility to do whatever I needed. If you are n
__label__1 Having my phone flashed with CyanogenMod, I bought this app. With it, I'm able to write sound files to the internal memory for ringtones. Sure you can do it on the SD card, but when the SD card is mounted, the sound files cannot be read for obvious reaso
__label__1 I don&apos;t know what that guy was talking about, but both products on the market are the same version. And how can you NOT purchase this! Get it if you&apos;re root. Great sale.
__label__1 Fun in the car!
__label__0 It purchased my money I paid for and it never downloaded!!!!! DO NOT PURCHASE IT STOLE MY MONEY!!:/ :( I hope everybody reads this before purchasing.
__label__1 this game is great. I can't stop playing this game. you play and unlock stuff it is so fun. and you can play with friends by the web or just a game where you pass the device I love it.
__label__1 It is so fun I love it I could play it all day but on a rainey day I would.
__label__0 I can only believe that the reason ANYONE could possibly give this more than one star is because they have never played the Android or iPhone and even iPad version, which has been available for over 5 years now on iPhone. To label this as HD is false adv
__label__1 this game is so worth the money the graphics are out of this world GREAT!!!!The only thing that is bad is that when u do bets or some thing it is so confusing. :/
__label__1 I do enjoy playing uno and it works great! I have played it a number of times and no problems.
__label__1 you need to make new rules like quit 7 and jump in on the same color or same number k.
__label__1 this app is just like the card game. I love it. you can get it for your I pad or I pod too. I am reviewing the kindle fire version. it gets 5 stars!
__label__0 it says it is under 5MB Data then after you buy it it says you need to download another 80MB that's just crazy! wasted my. .99 on this!
__label__1 It's just like the real game! You can play alone or with other people. It makes you follow the rules to a &#34;T.&#34;
__label__1 I've loved uni since I was a kid. My family used to play together all the time. This version has got great graphics, easy flowing gameplay, and different modes to play. I had never heard of the penalties, jump-in, and 7-0 versions of play until I bought 
__label__1 This is a great game that I can play with my 10 yr old grandson.  We really enjoy it, and this way he can't lose the cards again !!
__label__1 Who doesn't love a good game of UNO?  Its just like I remember as a kid!  So fun and easy to play that my 3yo plays it and has beaten me a couple of times!
__label__0 I paid 5 bucks for this app that takes an hour to download the extra space it needs just for the stupid thing to crash.  I love the real game, but this app is a total waste of time and money.  If I could rate it below 1 star I would.  Be warned.  It is n
__label__1 I bought it and love it.  It is addicting and time consuming.  Brings back memories of playing as a kid.
__label__1 Reminng oe's cldood,  remember this game was fun! Playing with cosins, siblings, and friends and even my mom and dad got into it. t ia fun game - n electronic gme wl ever replace the feeling of playing with a group, an ceaply, to. Great gmes for all ages
__label__1 Who doesn't love UNO? Fun for everyone at home or one the go, and the best part is you don't have to shuffle cards!
__label__1 I love this game! If you love Uno like I love Uno you will enjoy this game. It's like playing in a game with people without the cards. I highly recommend this.
__label__1 This version of Uno has you set up in a kind of progressive game. You start out with just you against 1 computer opponent with all the basic rules. As you win against the computer and get further and further into the game, they throw in a few variations.
__label__1 I bought this for my Kindle fire and love it! I only had to pay .99 for it. I'm addicted to uno.
__label__1 has been a source of lots of fun, can;t always get folks together for a game so this takes the place pretty well!
__label__0 I start up uno and it says all rights are BLAH BLAH BLAH and then it goes off----SERiously? Also I have a kindle fire so
__label__1 I don't understand the other negative reviews either.  This game plays beautifully on my Kindle Fire.  Lots of fun!  Highly recommended!
__label__1 Very addicting game. Cant stop playing this game , its one of my favorites, It is so worth the download
__label__1 Grandkids really enjoy playing the game with each other an friends too.  I thank you for having good games to play.
__label__1 good app if (please heed the last word) ya love uno. The game keeps me occupied if im sitting at the eye doctor for 2 hours. Then there is the fact that the game opponents STINK on normal. Ugh. But other than that, great game!
__label__1 This app is a pretty good app, I have a great time when I play this.  Don't listen to the bad reviews because they are off of previous versions of the game.  I have a kindle fire, so this game is meant for it.  For all those people complaining about how 
__label__1 best ele uno game I've played have to figure out how to play on line with my friends and family got to get them to buy it
__label__1 When I got my new Kindle Fire, I wanted to check out the games, and apps.  I saw the UNO game and downloaded it right away, the only problem I have with the UNO game is once I start playing - I don't want to stop!!  You get so many styles of this game to
__label__0 this game took my money I downloaded it then every time I truer to play it it keept saying FORCE CLOSE I wish I could give it zero stars
__label__1 One of the classic game to play; UNO. It's such a great game. No loading issues for me, it's awesome that you also don't need to be online to play.
__label__1 We played Uno a lot when my son was younger.  Sometimes my husband and I play.  It's nice to play even against the computer.
__label__1 This program runs smoothly and is fun to play.  I like the options the game offers.  I highly recommend this program.
__label__1 Uno is fun because it's like the real life version, but it's for Kindle Fire.  There are added sound effects so it could look awesome.  This game is recommended for people who play the real life version.  I hope this game is recommended for you.  You wil
__label__0 It offers single player game but doesn't work. Had to download something else for it to work on my Fire. Too confusing, like the original board game much better. I uninstalled it, glad it was free.
__label__1 Don`t start this game if you have to go to work cause it`s so addictive that you`ll call in sick to stay home just to continue playing!!  Get the free Kindle version, which offers single player game style tournament or multiplayer online plays with many 
__label__1 another good game, however, have to figure out how I can use it without being connected to internet..I think you have to download it...
__label__1 Kept the kids busy for hours when traveling. Easy for children to learn to play. Good to burn time when waiting in airports.
__label__1 get this game no matter what but make sure you get it for the kindle fire the multi-player is incredible
__label__1 As a child, Uno was one of my favorite games. Our deck had seen a lot of abuse - cards were bent, stained red from cherry koolaid, corners were torn away. I miss that deck - the cards were soft from use and felt great to handle.This is a fun version of t
__label__1 Very pleased with this game on my Kindle Fire.  Its got different options on how to play.  I've used it several times
__label__1 Come on who does not love uno. It is old school. It is a fun game and passes time a must have game.
__label__0 I did not like because it required additional steps to download.  Something that was not stated up front. I was very disappointed.
__label__1 This game has great graphics, nice ability to customize how you want to play.  I have to wait 4 hours at an activity for my son - this made the time fly.
__label__1 Lots of variations/options to play so it isn't boring.  Can play as single or multiple players.  I'm really enjoying it.
__label__1 I find this game is fun for everyone.  It's like I start playing and I can't put the dog gone thing down.  I'm 54 years old & I'm getting called to supper.
__label__0 I CAN'T RATE THIS BECAUSE I DIDN'T ORDER OR INSTALL THIS ITEM.I WOULD LIKE TO TRY IT IF IT DOESN'T COST TOO MUCH.
__label__1 This game on the kindle is fantastic,I would recommend this game for all uno lovers &lt;3 It's very fun ^_^
__label__1 oh wait...draw four. Uno. (I hate when people do that). This game is fun and addictive, and works well on the Kindle Fire
__label__1 This game is fun and entertaining. I play it when I want to relax or just pass the time. enjoyable
__label__1 UNO is one of my favorite childhood games. My 9 yr old grandson loves this game and sometimes wehn he starts playing it on my kindle fire I can't get him to stop.
__label__1 I really enjoy playing this game. Love the set up and graphics. Its really fun and enjoyable... easy to use!
__label__1 this is one of the best games created for kindle fire you can't even lose the cards I am so about to play it you will not regret getting this I say 5 stars
__label__1 I love to play uno!  This is easy because I play against 3 other player and always have a good time!
__label__0 bought this app for $.49 and its terrible. Did the registration and it won't recognize me. Music is loud and annoying. Can't do anything except play the game alone. Deleted it and gave $.49 to chatity.
__label__0 I know how to play unowned, but what is with these random chalanges and jump-in crap? If you know what it all is then good for you! I'm not happy with this :(
__label__1 This was great.  I was looking for some games for the kindle and I have to admit this one was addictive.  Kudos for all that were involved in this app.  I would recommend this to anyone.  Good job.  I will look for more apps from Gameloft.
__label__1 The paid version is the same as the free version, with the exception of there are no banners or adds that will slow down the game play.  Other than that both versions play the same
__label__1 What a fun game.  It had options to the game that I had never played with people.  It also changed up the game and had variations to the mini games and tournaments which keep it very interesting.  Would recommend it to a friend.
__label__1 I PLAY THIS GAME EVERY DAY AND WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO EVERYONE WHO LIKES THIS TYPE OF GAME BECAUSE IT PLAYS EASY
__label__1 I Love to play UNO and it helps pass the time on the road when we are traveling to and from our jobs.
__label__1 Pretty addictive game. I've played this on the Xbox and became pleased to see I can enjoy it on my Kindle as well. The app works very well every time.
__label__1 i like all the different options when playing, like against another player or being able to play online or against the computer.
__label__1 The reason that it won't download the extra info is because you have bad Internet but I have good Internet .
__label__1 I like playing this game.  i play and beating my mom when we play & pass.  I can play by myself or with someone.
__label__0 , If i would. If If I could give this app zero stars it never loads it takes up A LOT of room and it is just plain stupid save your money
__label__1 sometimes...you want a card game and no one will be available to play....this can be played by just one person and it is so much fun.  and you can actually win...LOL...It can also be played by more than one player.  So of the rules are new to us, but we 
__label__1 I loved this game. It was user friendly and format follows the actual game. It is goo for adults or kids!
__label__1 IF YOU HAVE EVER PLAYED UNO YOU WILL LIKE THIS ONE...EASY TO PLAY AND A LOT OF FUN.  KIDS WOULD LOVE IT I WOULD THINK...THE WHOLE FAMILY TOGETHER.
__label__1 I play this card game all of the time. I've had no glitches with it and no other problems either.
__label__1 UNO has been a favourite of mine since the early '80's. It's great to be able to play it against 3 (cpu) people, or against 1 (cpu) player whenever the mood strikes.It's a card game, so don't expect mind-blowing graphics. The graphics are perfectly suffi
__label__1 Since getting my kindle fire I have downloaded countless apps but this by far my favorite!!! I play it every single day and it never gets old...tournament mode is awesome!!!
__label__1 Works great for me! On my Kindle Fire it's never had any problems. I haven't had any of the issues other reviewers mentioned. The cost of 99&cent; seems really cheap for how much fun I've had.
__label__1 My son loves the game and plays it often.  Sometimes the sound disappears so we have to shut down the Ipad and restart and the sound comes back
__label__1 i like to play this with the kids so i got it to entertain my self it is fun. and will kill some time if you need to
__label__1 My grandson play this game all of the time. It's helping him learn rule of the game and is teaching him colors.
__label__1 I love this game because it is like the real card game but you don't have to play with family
__label__1 I love this one because I love the game growing up and would like to have more friends with kindles play it so I could have someone to play against
__label__1 I loved playing this game. It was very easy to play and I would recommend the game to everyone.It's a condensed version of the card game.
__label__0 I paid for nothing on this because I can't get past typing in my name. Its like the touch screen wont work. very disappointed! I went back and started over and it let.me pick color ...but would not let me pick Icon. So I went back and started over. Then 
__label__1 I don't think this game deserves the review it has right now. 2.5 stars is ridiculously low rating. great game, fun and good graphics.
__label__1 If you like UNO and don't have anyone to play with this is a good app to keep your fingers busy.
__label__1 this game is incredible. definitely worth $0.99! it is a good time killer and not hard to use. there are so many different ways to play. get it!!!!
__label__1 This is a computer game it is not as fun as the real card game, but it is fun when you have no one around to play the card game with you.
__label__1 One of my favorite personal apps.  I usually play this while I'm watching TV because its fun but still easy to play with out giving it my full attention.
__label__1 I will always love this family classic. It's especially fun to play with the new rules in the tournament mode.
__label__1 This app is so much fun. There are few things that the original uno does not have. I highly recommend getting this app. You should get this app.
__label__1 Alway s a favorite played uno sinvce I was a kid.  Fun to take it anywhere and not have to have anyone to play with
__label__1 GOOD GRAPHICS layout WOULD RECOMMEND TO OTHERS very user friendly can choose number of players to play with playable from device

__label__1 I was so delighted when I saw this title was available for my new Coby MID7015 tablet! It's so much fun I'd rather play this then watch TV! Lots of levels and the computer plays very well. I get my butt kicked on the "normal" level! Great sound effects, 
__label__1 This game is like the original uno and is loads of fun for everyone. I would recommend this game for any one who likes the original uno! Good for all ages that can play cards.
__label__1 Gameplay on the Kindle Fire HD is very smooth and flawless, even with online opponents.  Well made app.  Great job!
__label__1 Nice to be able to play one of my favorite games even when no one is around to play it with me.
__label__1 My daughter loves UNO. My daughter loves to cheat at UNO. With the electronic version she has to beat me fair and square, which she frequently does. I'm just glad to finally have a level playing field.
__label__1 I grew up playing uno. This computer game app is wonderful to play and I can spend hours engrossed trying to beat it.  I especially like the tournament mode.  Although the application gives you the impression you are playing with others, nothing beats a 
__label__1 We play uno all the time,  mostly for real with our friends, we have uno nights,  but when I can't get out a game on my kindle is almost as good
__label__1 I have no idea why people are leaving bad reviews, I love it! It runs great and I've had no problems with it on my Kindle Fire. The graphics look wonderful on the larger screen!
__label__1 I love this game. Some of the rules, I wish I could alter which game or rules I would like to play, but I love it anyway. The kids love it also. It is fun.
__label__1 she loved it and is 7 keeps her busy when she needs something to entertain her i highly recommend it.
__label__0 I bought this game thinking  about how much I LOVE the game uno, But you pretty much  play the computer which always wins. Know fun twist to the game,  Nothing to win or no fun little prizes you could win! I am not a big fan
__label__1 This game is alot of fun but I thought it was hard to figure our right away, Fun to play!
__label__1 I love this card game.  Where your playing with two players or four.  A good pass time.  I recommend this game.
__label__1 When I first got the game and started playing their things were happening that I had never seen before in playing this game.  I changed things back to standard play without the crazy rule changes on some of the editions.
__label__1 I got this app for me,but my kids play it way more than I do. It works great and has no glitches!!
__label__0 Super irritated right now! Purchased this app and it boots up just to crash! I want my $2.99 back!!!!ahhhhh!
__label__1 I love uno. I like the way it looks on my kindle fire. This is a good pass time when you are bored. The virtual guests that I play against is fun. I win everytime.
__label__1 I had no problem with this app. My daughter and I cannot get enough of the game on my kindle. I recommend this app to anyone. It's a great past time.
__label__1 not sure what other reviewers are talking about...this game is great.  I play it and my six year old.  we love it.
__label__1 A old family game that I love and continue to love and play. Each game is unique and you never know if your going to win or lose
__label__1 I find it entertaining. The game gets long at times but you can pause it. It is like the card game!
__label__1 totally suggest you try this. its just like when you were a kid but with a twist and you don't have to beg your brothers and sisters to play. it is so Great!! oh and it has yet to crash on me. Whoot Whoot!!!!!!!
__label__0 disgusting.  if u want this app, I recommend you play with the paper not this stupid app. it takes too long to load.
__label__1 Fun passes the time. Good purchase. No wifi needed. I reccommend this app. Don't know why its low rates. Awesome
__label__1 I think this game is very well done. I haven't had any problems with it. it's just like playing the card version only you don't have to wait or find somebody to play with. you can play whenever you feel like.
__label__1 If you love the card game you will love the kindle version.  Greast twist on different versions of the UNO game.  Addicting once you start playing
__label__1 i love love love this game.. its awsome fun. you ll like it too. give it a try. great way to trick your little ones into learning thier colors & numbers lol
__label__1 This was one of the first games downloaded when I got my Kindle. I had hours of fun with it. I would recommend it to anyone.
__label__0 The action on this game is inexcusable. No wonder it us selling at a reduced price right now! Transitions are slow, selecting your card is a pain, &amp; countering an opponent with the same card is even worse. All of this takes one of my favorite games o
__label__0 I downloaded this for my Kindle Fire and it didn't work at all. Had to delete it. Was very disappointed because Uno is one of my favorite card games
__label__0 If you have a kindle fire this game wont download! Ive gotten three gameloft games and they all don't work!
__label__1 If you love Uno you will love this game. It also learned a lot of the rules I did not know. Now I am kicking butt in regular on online UNO
__label__1 Good game. freezes some times but I still play it and it's easy to play all the the time great

__label__1 Love it! Have always loved this app & really appreciate it on my Kindle Fire!!! Fantastic & loads of Fun!!
__label__1 This classic board game brought to life on the tablet is a lot of fun and very well done. The free version that I orginally had only workd on the older Kindle Fires and not on the HD Kindle which I was not happy about. However, the paid version was only 
__label__0 I have no idea why, but this game requires a lot of memory.  After I installed the game, another screen pops up and says it needs an additional 98 mb of memory, do I want to proceed with download.  Well, I didn't and just ended up deleting this.  Anyone 
__label__1 I enjoy playing this game now just as I did as a kid. The only dislike I have is that now I can't play it anymore unless I have WiFi. I think this problem should be fixed. This started happening after I completed the game.
__label__1 I love using this game when I need some mommy veg out time its easy but very fun also. Caution can be addictive :)
__label__0 Spent my .99 for the game (love Uno) Only to discover I couldn't get it on my fire, because of the 80 mgb it requires! What a waste of a buck! :( Now know I will avoid any and all apps from Gameloft!
__label__0 Doesn't work on my kindle....memory storage not large enough...should be in bold letters before purchase...wasted money on this, very unhappy....
__label__1 UNO (Kindle Tablet Edition) is a great andfunny game to have on your kindle fire. I enjoy it a lot.
__label__1 Uno!!! I love this game, i have the iphone version but it is so much better on a bigger screen.
__label__1 ok its avery fun app works great achievements for gameloft live working but on uni live my gameloft live ant open so some major bugs but fun app
__label__1 A lot of apps on the app store are underrated, and this is no execption. This is a fun and easy to use app! I used to have the uno app on my Android and it looked too small but on the Kindle Fire it looks great and its easy to use. Last night I even play
__label__1 just like the card game. Great way to be able to play uno on your own when there is no one else around to play with you.
__label__1 I've been playing this version on UNO for weeks now and loved it, EXCEPT.  I cannot find any way within the app, nor online or at facebook to be able to change things in my "account", like adding picture, reviewing and adding friends.  NOW, for a couple 
__label__1 i love beating my friends & family playing this old time favorite. Its really fun to play. Its great to play a childhood game again.
__label__1 I love playing traditional UNO and so it follows that I would enjoy playing this version when I don't  have other people to play with the traditional way.  I would definitely recommend this game for any UNO lovers!
__label__1 I have always loved uno have play at home.  It is so much fun.  If you like card games you love this game
__label__1 If you remember laying this card game when you were a kid than you are going to love this game. The app loads just fine and in no time at all.
__label__1 I love it. I love it. Spoiler Alert! I love it. This game is so much fun! I play all the time. If i didn't suck at it so much this game would be perfect
__label__1 I downloaded this for my kindle fire and it works perfectly. The game is very addicting. It adds some very fun twists to the classic Uno game.
__label__1 This is one of my favorite games that I have downloaded so far. So worth $.99The only problem I have came across is that I sometime have problems pressing the buttons. But if I turn my kindle off and then on again it works just fine.I am so addicted to t
__label__0 stupidest app ever why is it in the amazon app store if its not compatible for the kindle fire unless you whant to give up80 mega bytes stupid I shan't my money back or amazon could get rid of the 80 mega bytes
__label__1 I have it on my ipod and I play it a lot so I gave it a on my kindle fire and I loved it is better on my fire.  great 5stars
__label__1 Everyone knows the game of UNO and this version for the Kindle Fire takes it to a whole new level.  You get to enter tournaments which have different rules for the cards which makes it more challenging to play and as you play you are able to unlock vario
__label__0 It's nothing like when you play with you family! Just play real UNO! Don't get this app! If you get this app I will find you and uninstall every single app you own! Just kiddin'. But seriously don't get this app.
__label__0 Though it doesn't mention it anywhere on the page or technical details, this app requires an additional 80mb download once you've "installed" it.  This is not noted anywhere.  Customers are not warned about this.  The Size of the file under Technical Spe
__label__1 If you grew up enjoying UNO then you'll enjoy the time it takes to play the game. It's sort of like Monopoly; it's not over very quickly! But, like I said, stick to it and have some good times. When you get tired of all the copy-cat games, fall back to U
__label__0 &quot;game requires additional data start download now&quot;  am sorry I paid for this.  I won't download anything more for this and I can't use it unless I do.  I guess I uninstall.  so long hard earned money.
__label__1 This app is very fun cause u don't need inherent to use it!!  There is a tourement mode and quick play and multiplayer and single mode!!!!!  On multilayer u can do local or one dievce or random ppl! Hope u enjoy this apply if u do get it I reccomend jump
__label__1 I wanted to take a moment and leave this review since this app has a ridiculously low rating. The app works fast, fine and beautifully on my kindle fire.Not only that but as soon as you launch it, it will require an additional 80megs of space for the HD 
__label__1 another excellent card game on the kindle HD. highly recommend to all the card players.  an older game that keeps coming back for more.
__label__1 When you get a plus 4 wild card I am never sure whether to challenge or not -- what is it that makes the challenge successful as opposed to failing and having to take 6 cards!
__label__0 I purchaced this app as a family game to find it needed extra memory than what it needed at installation. Very disappointed with this app. I don't recommend installing.
__label__1 my 9 year old and 6 year old like to play this on the kindle fire. my 6 yr old likes it more. glad i purchased it. tons of fun.
__label__0 Do not get this on kindle fire. I just got it and it downloaded. it will not open.it said that it is not compatible. DO NOT GET THIS APP. I WANT A REFUND NOW!
__label__1 I loved this app as it is exactly like the card game in real life.  Challaging and yet fun.  All ages as they is an easy and challaging version.
__label__1 I love playing UNO on my ipad, it is very different than playing with real people.I have it on my kindle fire also so others in my family can play.
__label__1 I was worried about dowloading this after some of the reviews but I'm so happy I did. The graphics are sharp and the game play is fast. I've had zero problems running it on my Fire. Yes you do have to have a chunk of space available,  and it sucks that t
__label__0 glitches, LOST the app, DISAPPEARED from cloud,CUSTOMER SERVICE NOT WILLING TO LISTEN HELP OR RESOLVE, FORCED TO PAY FOR SOMETHING I ALREADY PURCHASED PREVIOUSLY!!
__label__0 It required more download to operate. I dont want something that is going to eat up more of my Kindle memory.
__label__1 It's what it should be. Saw that this app has a low review and was surprised and curious as it has always worked fine for me and I've had it since last Christmas. If you like uno and you have a dollar then it's not a bad buy!
__label__1 I've been enjoying playing Uno on my Kindle, it's fun! Playing uno helps relieve my stress! I really like it
__label__0 I have to admit I have not played because it took so much space to download, I stopped the download.
__label__0 One of the worst games I've ever downloaded.  Don't waste money.  Sluggish, hard to control cards, poor selection of options.
__label__1 I really enjoy playing UNO and always have.  I was pleased to learn that you could play a two player game on the Kindle with this edition of UNO.  Thanks for making it that way.
__label__1 How can you go wrong with Uno?? Love this game! Always have! Love playing it on my Kindle! It's very realistic, like you're playing with your crew!
__label__1 I just got this on my daughter's kindle fire that I am giving her for Christmas, but I had to play it to see...it was very fun and I know she will love it!
__label__1 UNO is a fun game to play on my kindle. UNO is not a difficult game. Children and adults can play UNO.
__label__0 So I got this app on my kindle fire,and does not even work. Every time I try to download the extra information it does not work!!!
__label__1 I;ve akways enjoyed playing UNO (the card game) with my grandsons.  They really get competitive and I always lose to them.  This new app is a lot better because you can play 1 to 4 people.  It's nice having the app know the rules - grandsons make them up
__label__0 I KNOW HOW TO PLAY THIS GAME,  BUT THE STUPID APP SEEMS TO HAVE A MIND OF ITS OWN. IT WILL NOT SHOW ME ALL MY CARDS AND WHEN I TRY TO MOVE THE CARDS BLOCKING (SOMETIMES MORE THAN HALF THE HAND)  THEY WILL NOT MOVE OR IT PICKS A CARD AND PLAYS IT,  AND SO
__label__1 electronic uno is so much fun. it's so much fun you still get to play with other people but no one gets to cheat.
__label__0 Just  downloaded and went to open and play....so excited. First thing it tells me off that the app requires an additional 98MB of space to work/play....say what?!?! For me, not impressed. Taking my 99 coinloss and deleting the app. VERY disappointed at t
__label__1 I loved this game growning up in Texas, Now its on my Kindle soooo happy I got it. Get it!
__label__1 I love uno.  It is such a fun and challenging game.  I usually play when I am getting my nails done--doesn't require much technique!!
__label__0 I had this game on my aneroid phone and it was fun so when I saw the Kindle Fire Edition on sale today I was happy and bought it but then when I tried to open it I get an error that says not compatible with my device.  crap.  Do not waste your money.
__label__1 This app is a lot of fun, very enjoyable , Fun in doctor office ect. I am very glad I decided to download this .
__label__1 We played the &#34;FREE&#34; version and decided to just buy it instead! My 6yr old loves this game! I have as a free app on my Android(she fell in love w/it), so I found it for her on the Kindle. It's a keeper!
__label__1 This was the first game I bought for my kindle. I play with it everyday. I reccomend this game to everyone.
__label__1 This is an old school game that will never go out of style. I always loved this and play it all the time.
__label__1 What can I say, UNO is UNO!!  It is a great classic game!!! I love it, my grand's love it!!!
__label__1 I have had no problems with this on my kindle fire.  actually I think its quite fun!! maybe the old version was bad?? This one is well worth the 99&cent; for it!!! Try the tournament for some crazy fun! Two thumbs up for the kindle fire version!!!
__label__0 My grandkids wanted to play this game while visiting, so we downloaded the app.  I have not used it since so cannot comment on it personally.  I don't use it and plan to delete it.
__label__1 I used to have this on my blackberry and loved playing it. My only problem with this game is the fact that I have to turn the sound off EVERY time I play. fix that and it's nearly perfect. The only way getting this game would have been better is if it ha
__label__1 Great graphics and Color.  Great app.  I wish they would make it compitable with my htc rhyme so I can also play it on my phone.
__label__1 ITS A GREAT GAME, The game levels are pretty cool, i love the different scenarios and awards and achievement levels. another great pass time and you don't have to be connected to the internet! the only thing i do not understand is how to connect to anoth
__label__1 I really like this game.  Haven't figured out the whole game yet, because there are different versions of this game than just classic including some rules that I have never heard of before.  You can pretty much set it up to play whatever version you want
__label__1 I can use this game as a Bible study tool in my spare time at home. To try to get the correct answer , you don't have to be a scholar but you will need to know something about the Bible. When I get one wrong, I go back to that particular scripture and re
__label__1 Bible Reference Game by Thy Word is True is an excellent game. I like it very much and highly recommend it! It is great!
__label__1 I LOVE IT, IT'S NOT A GAME REALLY, IT'S A REFERENCE IT TEACHES YOU THINGS YOU DON'T KNOW OR HAVE FORGOTTEN.
__label__1 I find it keeps me on my toes.  I have been challenged by trying to remember location of scriptures and if I remember details of events.  Anyone who wants to study the Bible should use this app.
__label__1 Love any program that helps one to learn more about God's word.  This is a good activity to use  in free time with Bible students, as a quiz,  a fun activity with friends or just to see how much you know about the scriptures in the Bible.
__label__1 The amazing part is that it takes you directly to the passage when you select the correct answer.The best, my employers are Christian and they love it too.  Hours of fun and education.  A must buy.
__label__1 I am really enjoying the Bible Reference Game. I really like it, and I like playing it. It was a great find.
__label__1 My daughter is 16 months old and loves animals! This app is great to entertain her with! She loves to learn new animals and sounds!
__label__1 this is a great app for toddlers.  My girl is 2 and loves to hear each animal sound..Keeps her entertained for a while..Great learning tool,,I would definately recommend
__label__1 My daughter has fun with this app and so do I. I love how there are many animals and sounds. It draws her in and teaches her.
__label__0 this is like the worst ever. I am 12 and it is the worst I have ever bownlowded,trust me that's a lot
__label__0 My daughter loves puzzles and dogs so she was so excited! But then after we downloaded the accepted button kept disappearing before we could hit it so we were never able to open the game
__label__1 Gave Kindles to my kids for Christmas.  They love to download free Amazon apps for their entertainment!  They enjoyed this app.  My favorite part... It's FREE!!!  Thanks Amazon!
__label__0 I never could get this game to work. I couldn't get past the terms and conditions. I agreed to the terms and conditions and it wouldn't move past the terms and conditions page.
__label__1 he just turned three and he enjoyed it very much. great pics! very cute for learning sounds. and white peacocks do exist!
__label__1 My 2 year old granddaughter really enjoys this app! It is a nice app for the little ones and provides a good amount of learning( I learned some sounds I didn't know).  I highly recommend this app for 1 + 2 year olds - it keeps them busy
__label__1 This is so cute.I got this so that when my little grandchildren visit,it keeps them occupied!I love this app. Thanks Amazon
__label__0 hate it's one of those apps that comes with my phone and I can't remove without rooting. when I tried remove it from my memory card, said I couldn't because I don't have administrative permission. I prefer Pandora or Tunein.
__label__0 Pros: You can play offline.Cons: I installed Slacker, de-installed it as it didn't have what I wanted. When I gave it another try, I couldn't install it. Also, lack of stations.It's one of these great ideas that never work.
__label__1 I found this radio browsing in the menu on my Blue ray player I was kind of skeptical to go forward, likely I did it, this is an awesome radio the menu is very easy to go to, I could find an amazing variety and selected music, don&#8217;t need to pick or
__label__1 Having tried many differant &#34;free&#34; internet radio pages, I have since whittled the list down to 2 that I use consistantly: Slacker and Pandora. They both perform very well, Slacker focusing more detail in creating custom stations while Pandora's 
__label__0 It is SO slow, i just uninstall it, and forgot it. TuneIn Radio is much better. This one, is, &#34;slacking&#34;.
__label__0 I have been radio plus member for the last 2yr  and today slacker decides that they want to have you subscription billed through Amazon. I can understand logic behind it, given that it is the kindle version ,however now even though I have been billed pre
__label__1 This is on my kindle fire I use it when Pandora was only allowing certain amounts of free listening a month. Great for exploring your music taste finding new bands you may like and the ads are less annoying than the ones on Pandora
__label__1 I find this app fits my moods better.  The variety has been really nice to chose from and listen to.
__label__0 I can understand a commercial every few songs for the free version but increasing commercial counts is annoying when you hear the same ones over and over. The new update plays 2 commercials in a row after 2 songs played. This app is temperamental with th
__label__0 Slacker used to be so much better. You could listen to much more than you can now.Goodbye Slacker.
__label__1 the best way to listen to radio. you like rock?it's there. you like pop?its there. all the music you want is at your finger tips. 5 stars. no don't the best radio app.
__label__1 Slacker I love .I have been listening to Slacker for years now. I can play all kinds of music. I do listen to so much. This music app made it so much easy for me to listen to my music. I make can make a station with only artist I want in it. SKIP AS MANY
__label__1 This is the best online radio so far in my book it it better than pandaro  its easy to pull up and play.
__label__1 Now here is a great music app. My all-time favorite. Slacker Does not slack when it comes to variety and customizing ability.
__label__0 I am not the happiest camper when it comes to slacker....On my Kindle and Xbox, the app shuts down a lot and freezes...I've tried to uninstall and reinstall several times to get the same thing...Now, slacker as a whole, I like...But the app itself, I don
__label__1 Over Christmas they had Christmas music 24 7 loved it now that the holidays are over i can listen to several stations that i enjoy in stereo with my Kindle HD lots of fun
__label__1 Works great on my Kindle Fire. The app itself is pretty stable and it allows me to listen to my own customized stations or pre-made stations for free. Much better then Pandora or SiriusXM. I decided to subscribe to the service for $4 per month to get rid
__label__1 I have always been a slacker fan, and now to listen it to on my Kindle its freaking amazing! The sound is perfect, lets me listen to what I want to listen too. I just love Slacker, has so many more options than Pandora!
__label__1 its amazeing app love the music on the app very good app loveee it the music on the app is good very good
__label__1 I'm addicted to this app. I have it on my kindle fire HD and mobile phone. I hear it all the time. It's my new radio :) slacker radio has the updated music. Pandora is eh compare to slacker radio. Yes, this is an awesome app.
__label__1 I cancelled my Sirius and use slacker running thru my Droid/car radio. Only complaint I could think of is the X to close ads are too small on my phone and it sends me to their ad site at times. I love how I can block Metallica completely, they are over p
__label__1 I love this as much as pandora radio. Possible even more so. I never heard of it before til my husband found it.
__label__1 Very good selection. Plays perfectly. Not to many commercials. Only shortfall is the Hawaiian station that is on AOL is not available  in the app.
__label__1 the. best app ever so much better than pandora it is so awsome get it so much better than the other radio apps
__label__1 this app is decent, i'd reccomend over Pandora, doesn't buffer as much as Pandora. of course its sometimes a lil laggy when only on a 3g coverage but no where near as bad as Pandora or other competitors
__label__0 THIS  is not what I was thinking it was. I did read about it. I was mislead...not because of the AMAZON review.
__label__1 It comes it clear and gives you a wide variety to choose from and is free when it says it was.  You can upgrade, but you don't have to.
__label__1 This app is Easy to maneuver and tons of music great app, nice selection of tunes. 5 star app all the way.
__label__1 Check your speed on your wi-fi, because this is a must have!!.. I have been rocken nothing but slacker for weeks. You will lag any radio if your wi-fi is slow and working on things open and closeing. It's so worthy it made my &quot;Must Have&quot; list..
__label__1 i like being able to listen to music while playing my games on the kindle. i would recommend to others.
__label__1 Whatever the genre this music app. delivers and then some.Surprisingly user friendly.Don't hesitate, A MUST HAVE!Happy Listening
__label__1 Slacker is a great app to listen to all your favorite music on.  There are three levels of membership, with each offering different benefits.  After just a couple days at the free level, I was so impressed and loved the options offered that I upgraded to
__label__1 Okay I love it really I do but..... I have had to download this app I think 7 times now it just kept freezing up when a really good song came on. But other then that I really like it!!!!!! It's a lot better then Pandora I just wish I could get the full l
__label__1 Slacker seems to sound better & has easier customization. As usual, the app version is more spartan than the desktop interface.Give slacker a try.
__label__1 i listen to at of internet radio during the day whie i work. I've tried them all. Slacker Ilike due to fact you create your own stations. Music fits the station profile and station creation.Preset stations are pretty good also. This app will make a nice 
__label__1 So much better than Pandora. There are ads occasionally, but not as much as the other stations, and Slacker has a larger variety of pre-made stations to pick from.
__label__1 Awesome app !! It came on my TB and I tried it out. It's awesome. I love it that I can listen to different genre's of music. Whatever I'm in the mood for. The best feature is the fact if I don't like or want to listen to a song I can skip it.
__label__1 This is my favorite internet radio. This has way better selection of music than Pandora and iHeartradio combined! I love the variety of songs they play and customization. You should definitely download it.
__label__1 I bought a radio latly and thaught that I needed music because Pandora is annoying sometimes I looked and asked my friends and slacker was the top Fav. out of all I reccomend this to music lover!
__label__0 It always asks for a premium. When I tried to get it, it wouldn't work again. Have fun listening to music for as long. As you have it
__label__1 This app works well for tablets like the kindle fire that will sometimes get into situations where there isn't a wifi network available.  The Slacker radio app lets you cache a station so that you can play your favorite station even when you don't have a
__label__1 Slacker offers a good selection of songs and stations for you to listen to and the app is easy to use on any mobilie device.
__label__1 Works great on my Kindle Fire HD.  If you want to listen to radio, this is a good one to choose.
__label__0 whenever I turn nh kindle on, slacker is open even if I didn't leave it on. its a prototype Hal.
__label__0 I have had a free slackers account for over seven years and was so excited to see an app was available for my Kindle Fire. That excitement was soon squelched by the inability to upgrade to a pay account on the Kindle, constant crashes, despite following 
__label__1 Slacker is easy to find on my phone and I can listen to songs that I want to hear.  Time is valuable at work, so going straight to songs that I enjoy is fantastic.
__label__1 love this, I can listen to any music I want anytime I want, I would highly recommend this to anyone
__label__0 so I deleted this because it was freezing all the time!! at first I thought it would be so cool because you pick yurt type of music and tyour favorite artists.... not worth it get pandora
__label__1 Been using their website for several years, chose it over Pandora because at the time I liked the station options better, not just by genre/artist but by time period.  I haven't revisited Pandora since to see if they've updated because I've been satisfie
__label__1 This is a free station and you have a multitude of genres to pick from. Great service and great music!
__label__1 i have no idea why people keep in saying this app sucks!!! this is one of the best music apps ever its not like Pandora where they choose ur artist on this u get to choose and the best is when u go on long trips that's okay because this doesn't need wifi
__label__1 Best music app ever. Don't even hardly use Pandora. Love love love slacked! Less commercials more music & more variety & skips
__label__0 I didn't like it because it took forever to create one station, the songs are way off! its hard to like any songs when I want to listen to a song it just makes a station for it instead! not worth the space!! -.-
__label__1 Since the latest updates. i've had no problems with the app. Songs load quickly, and even transition to the next almost instantly. The rating and ban system is supperior to other apps like pandora. And this has the Crucial feature of letting you review s
__label__1 easy to use, save all your fav songs....forget all the others this is the one to get if you are an eclectic music lover.
__label__1 I use to listen to pandora until I was turned on to slacker. I work at gym and the radio plays the same 24 hr rock blocks every day. Slacker mixes it up and songs that I or members do not like I can skip past.
__label__1 App works well on my kindle fire. I wish it was a little more &#34;fine tune-able&#34; rather than just radio stations but nice app all the same.
__label__1 puts pandora to shame!! It has so much too it that I can't stop singing it's praises!! I love this program and pay for the monthly with a smile.
__label__1 since you have to pay to listen on Pandora on mobiles now... :( I downloaded this app to listen to music! I'm soooooooo happy! you should download it ;) its awesome!
__label__1 After trying several streaming audio apps for Android, I have decided that Slacker is the best overall.  Slacker Radio constantly streams, unlike Pandora that randomly plays just a few seconds of a song and then goes to the next. Slacker never seems to r
__label__1 sounds good Wat is better Pandora or slackerdj dj djej sndnnd fjdjn dh dj dj dh dh th dud
__label__1 This is definitely the best radio app I have ever used! It the app that I use more than any other!!! I think that everyone should know about it!!! I LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!
__label__0 I deleted this from my kindle fire because it kept frezzing!!! and that update it was ridiculous!!!!!!! dislike this app so much
__label__1 Being a person who's not into computers this is my first I got it last year I'm a lot behind on my knowledge but how cool to type part of a lyric and the song  plays  it may be simple but it's very cool . Paula
__label__1 I came across Slacker Radio app by mistake, and I'm glad I did.  I currently have the Pandora, Tune In and I-Heart apps loaded on my Kindle.  I-Heart Radio being my favorite, until I came across Slacker.  I listen to 80's music, both pop and rock and I  
__label__1 The sounds are good still learning how to tune the channels other than that it is a good site. Will work with it more and really enjoy it.
__label__0 Slacker is great, I use it all of the time but this update is terrible.  An older version was preinstalled on my phone and I finally got tired of the pop-up about an available upgrade so i did it.  I started regreting it almost immediately.  This new ver
__label__1 I love slacker.  I love to play Christian music and they have it.  I have slacker on three gadgets.  I have ther unpaid version so hear a commercial for slacker once in a while but that is ok with me..
__label__1 this is great for my husband love this so cool all his music and well mine also. so many different kinds of music he will love this.
__label__0 I couldn't enjoy the music for all messages to sign up for e- mail.  Ever time I tried it turned me down. If I really need this app. I would forgive you, so now I will go back panel.  You idiots. You don't deserve the 1 star but, yes 1 star. If you want 
__label__1 I love Slacker Radio! More variety and a LOT LESS repetition than the other internet radio app. Slacker Radio rocks!
__label__1 I know this is a rather long review of Slacker, but it will pretty much tell you all about it.I've been using Slacker Radio free on my smartphone for a few months. I upgraded to Premium for the 10.00 a month a couple months ago. I have NEVER paid for rad
__label__0 I have used Slacker with my computer, but I could not get it to function on my Kindle.  It seemed to install just fine, but then doesn't respond when I open the app.
__label__1 I listen to it almost daily. There is a wide variety of stations. I first used Slacker on AOL and was ecstatic to see available for my Kindle. Also, it doesn't time you out the way Pandora does - although, I use Pandora, too.
__label__1 I love this app, due to the fact that you can totally customize this channel to your exact choices and likes..
__label__1 This is definitely one of the better music streaming sites out there. Although Spotify is the best in the US in my opinion, when you travel, it doesn`t work sometimes, so Slacker is a more reliable option. Slacker has a great library of music and it all 
__label__0 waaaaay too many ads and you cant do anything without it telling you to upgrade!  disappointed in the way this promises more than it gives:(
__label__1 HTC EVO user here and two-years+ Slacker subscriber. Their license agreements with record labels makes the available selection for artists far better than Pand*ra. The Android app isn't any different than the web interface, which is easy to use and pleas
__label__1 I dont listen to anything else slacker radio personalized stations are awesome while mixing older songs and new ones from your favorite bands
__label__1 love all the choices, depending on your mood, they have the music for you.so glad i got to know slacker radio
__label__1 The playlists for each station are pretty nice. It seems to do a better job of finding songs with the same vibe to them as your selected artist than most radio apps. The commercial interruptions are not that frequent or obnoxious. I personally use this a
__label__1 I believe the rating says it all. Free music of all types and really easy to use. The only drawback is that you must have the internet to use.
__label__1 Oh I'm having such a dance and sing off listening to this wonderful musical entertainment. Being able to listen to all kinds of music both old and new is amazing and so Crystal clear. I love love love it!!!! :)
__label__0 I've heard this is a useful tool,  but app will not work on the kindle fire.  Would love to use this.
__label__1 Completely solved my problem with being to accept credit/debit cards for my small business without having to purchase another electronic device.  This is the only processor compatible with Kindle Fire.
__label__0 If you are considering using this service by Intuit, please read the Eula carefully for what little it's worth. Do your due diligence. Search online for "TurboTax C-Dilla" (and "TurboTax 2009's Fraudulent Consent" and "Intuit apology" as well) - read how
__label__0 The app came to Android on July 31, 2011.  Most of these reviews are before that and most are from June 16th.  Some of the reviews mention iPhone or iPad.  So most of these reviews are not for this exact product.  Also many reviews are not written like n
__label__1 Even if you do not have the card reader (mine does not read well), I use this app. I can input the credit card information by hand, have a customer sign my phone for the payment, and send a receipt by email or text - or both! I can put a memo for the pay
__label__1 Use it when ever I process a credit card... User friendly, quick and hassle free. Could not ask for more
__label__0 This app was a waste of a dollar and that's pretty hard to waste nowadays!!Can't even watch the movie just tells you about them...so lame!
__label__0 This would be the worst offer ever made on Amazon. It does nothing but give a description of the movies. You cannot access any to see. Even though it cost only 99c it was robbery
__label__0 I purchased this app with the understanding that you can watch these100 most......WRONG, WRONG, WRONG!!! You could watch them if you go rent or purchase them from another source, not from this app though. Just a reference list of movies &amp; the actors/
__label__1 OMGosh,  I am very nostalgic and this app fills the bill for taking you back to those teenage years, when most of these movies scared the daylights out of me.  diana
__label__1 Dont really like the movies available...wish I wouldn't have downloaded it. Probably won't use it do to the kind of movies that are offered,
__label__0 This is not at all what I expected. I deleted it as soon as I opened tha app on my Kindle.
__label__0 This is not movies to watch. :(  May I have back credits. I removed it in about three minutes. THANK YOU.
__label__0 I thought these were going to be viewable movies, its not, just a list of movies to watch. Was not what I thought I was getting
__label__0 i cant get the damm thing to work i would love it if it worked please help cause i would love to purchase it but it does not work.
__label__0 I didn't know the purpose..was it to tell us the top movies to watch?, show the movies to us? WHAT?
__label__0 So disappointed definitely a waste of time and money! This is only a list of movies to watch. You don't get to watch any of them!!!! Only give it a one star because I couldn't give it any less . Please don't waste your money on this!!!!
__label__1 JUST USE "AMAZON TEST DRIVE" it's great. because its an app of information you don't even have to pay for it....THANK YOU "AMAZON TEST DRIVE"!!!
__label__0 This is just a listing of movies with descriptions - not even a movie trailer. There is nothing here you couldn't find on the internet for free.  I thought it might have some old movies like some other apps I have like "Movie Vault - Classic Films" ($1.9
__label__1 This has to be the best one I have ever downloaded. It has a password protection on it which I love that about this one and its easy to use.
__label__1 I love this app its easy to use great display lots of log options I wish it would do the temperature chart from cycle to cycle not month to month
__label__1 I was not expecting to find an application like this one. It is so nice to have a calendar that is specifically for feminine issues. It helps track your time and symptoms. You won't regret this free purchase.
__label__1 I first got this because my period had started being irregular and I needed a little help figuring out the patterns and determining when my next period was going to start. I've been using this for months now and it really has helped a lot. Even when I ac
__label__1 i have to take medicashion on some days of my cycle this has helped me keep track of it and helps me show my doc no papers to keep up with and loose
__label__1 it is so* freaking addictive and fun I just have so funnnn(:every time I start playing it I cant put it down because that's how detemimened I am to get an even higher score
__label__0 it todally does not work don't waist your time trying to get it to woe it is horrible don't get it. it is a waist of time
__label__1 its so much fun i love to play it so so so so so so fun when im board i will play this game
__label__1 This is a really fun game if your bored get this game u can play it for a long time and its like their isn't a bottom to the board
__label__0 It is really boring and a waste of time perfect for people without a life, DON'T GET THIS GAME IT'S BORING.
__label__0 BORING!!! i hate this game so much. it is soo boring!! i understand it gwts faster and faster but still. it is way to simple
__label__0 This app is waaaaaaaaay too easy. If there were levels or something else, it would be OK, but still don't get it. most boring app on kindle. TERRIBLE!!!! Don't get it if your friend pays you. Yeah, it's that bad.
__label__0 its fun at first but then it gets super boring. its really easy too it ttakkes no skill at all. if you're good at tilting the screen then you'll be fine.
__label__0 Played for a total of 2 minutes. I can't see how it could of gotten 3 stars. It is not worth downloading even as a free app.
__label__0 wone tim I wus lik haveig a talnt sho an this musician lik did a magik trik lik with eggs I likd him butt he died cus he didn't win cus
__label__1 whenever I'm bord I play this game iv gone to level 275 already Iv played it for 4 months already but its your decision,id get it
__label__0 This game is slow to respond and boring, and had an ad I would not want my children to see, so I installed it in record time.
__label__1 whoever rates this 1 star didn't read the descry dug it never ends you idiot and my 2 year old sis loves to play this thanks for making the great app!
__label__1 Best game EVER!!! Ya know, when i started it, i didnt know how to play and was like DELETE! But i  figured it out, and i loved it! Great job Team 5 Soft.
__label__0 Sorry but this game is a real bust. It doesn't even qualify being called a game. A game should at least be fun and/or challenging. This is neither&hellip; plus it's really poor quality.
__label__1 Basically you need to make sure the little ball doesn't reach the top.  It is fun, and easy for my 3 year old.  he doesn't get frustrated with it.  We put the settings so that he can tilt the kindle fire instead of touching the sides.
__label__0 There's always something to say about keeping things simple. However, this time it's not a good thing.This game is so basic that it gets very old very fast. It doesn't help either that the world always scrolls by at the same rate, and the score creeps up
__label__1 Yes,I have this app and it's sooo fun :D It does work..I played it hundreds of times,it is so addicting.Oh and btw its FREE people...GET IT :P
__label__1 amazing game this game is fun and addicting. buehdudbibhubxjb dh d Neil ti xhm dbjncbxhx guxguxbxhchhd hdhbdub y y y y y ddy y _ _ ybd y
__label__1 Okay so I actually haven't played this game yet Cu's its still loading but every time I write one it sends it to my dads email and I wanted to say I love him so much! Hi dad.  I thought this would be easier than snailing you so hi ! I love you!!!!!!!! Se
__label__1 This a very fun game to pull out when you're bored. To be redundant, it is extremely addictive. I absolutely love fall down. :) I have to keep it from my friends or I won't get my kindle back for hours.
__label__1 pretty fun app free an only &frac12; a megabyte.was is not to like!thank you for reading this review!!
__label__1 I'm addictedto this game and all y'all haters are trippin! y'all can find some other game to rate bad cuz this game is funnnnn! I love it!
__label__1 Now this one will make people think you are nuts! ever wonder what every one is doing when they are holding their android app things up and tilting them side to side/ Well now you know! Keep the ball from getting crushed at the top...and the more you get
__label__1 I really suggest you getting this game it is really fun even though you just tilt back. And fourth it is just really fun. DOWNLOAD AND PLAY NOW!!!!!!!!!
__label__1 I have this game on my ipod touch and when I saw it on kindle I was so excited!!! I love it!! please get!!
__label__0 It is a very bad game. Only fun if your soooo bored that you are desperate. Probably more for little kids less for older kids and adults. They didn't make it very good. Presents no challenge.
__label__1 if you have nothing nice te type don't type anything at all you meanies why did you get this app if you said it was boring you should have read the thing that tells you about the app then you should decide and forget about the app and reviews if you revi
__label__0 all it does is you tilt your device and make a round ball.go down lower and lower.until you go over the screen.Do NOT BUY. WASTE OF TIME
__label__1 I agree that this game goes on and on. however this is a very very very very very very very very very very very fun game!!!!!!!!!!!!!  :):):);););):0:0:0;0;0;0
__label__0 Okay I just want to start off saying if anyone wants to waste time being bored this is the game for you and further more I want rather watch a snail snug along than play this game in the first 30-40 seconds I realized that I was more bored playing the ga
__label__1 My granddaughter got me hooked on this game...It is so much fun and a challenge. It is really helping my grandson with his co-ordination.  Great game and a lot of fun.
__label__1 No thought about it it is  addictive but the skills it takes to get 200points is amazing.  I recommended this game for people who like addicting,fun,  and cool games you might also reconise those game for the i phone 4.  ENJOY!!!!
__label__1 This App was fair, and my children enjoyed the games and the endless hours of fun. Easy for everyone to play and understand
__label__1 omg i thought the game was boring at fist but then it gets really fun. its a great game to play when you are sitting in the car without Internet. hope my review helped. but seriously get this game.
__label__1 the only reason its given all stars because.......u have to understand the sequence of events of game culture.So do not tease about this sad game........GIVE IT FREDOM!
__label__0 First of all it was free just alot of time was wasted installing and uninstalling the controls are terrible I played it for 1 round and then uninstalled it one word of advice DO NOT PAY FOR THIS APP!!
__label__1 I tried this game also and played it a few times. I think this and the Falldown 2 Classic could become addicting. It is challenging so try it. It was free, if you don't like it you can always deletel
__label__1 This app is a lot of fun. You half to tilt your device quick so the ball will keep falling. I highly recommend this app.
__label__0 this game is not worth it. the game itself is boring and not addicting at all. don't wast ur time downloading this app.
__label__1 i have a kindel fire and this game dosent give me any problems. i love this game. its addicting. i play it all the time with no problem
__label__0 I downloaded it to my kindlle fire and it completely didn't work it didn't seem that fun though. it was also hard to remove from my kindle
__label__1 I was hooked after the first try. I kept playing over and over again trying to beat my previous score. Great game.
__label__1 Really enjoyable game takes little effort and can get challenging. Its even free so you cant say anything bad about that.
__label__0 this game is so boring all you do is guide the ball were you want it to it is so belong I advise you not to get this ap. if you get this apyou will be bored forever and you will delete it from your device right away.
__label__0 so I downloaded this game and it is nothing like the picture. I thought it would be like that but I guess I was wrong.
__label__1 its a good game dont lissen to all those other freaks thet say it doesent work on kindle fire its great
__label__1 I love it is a great game but some levels are really hard I think you should get it it is fun.
__label__0 I don't like how u just go back and forth!!! its so boring and it goes on and on I don't think it will ever end!!!! also its so touchy when u tilt it it goes so extreme and messes u up!!!
__label__0 Falldown is perhaps , next to Drag Toilet Paper, the best representative sample of the types of games available  in a watered down software repository.  It is not something to be sought after ,  nor is it something to, in all good conscience, recommend. 
__label__1 this game is awesome just hurry to get the ball off the green parts its so fun and they don't time you:)
__label__1 I have a lot of fun playing this very simple game but boy does it get frustrating. You go from "too easy" to "aaaah no no no" quickly at times.It is fun to challenge friends especially.
__label__1 First off I love it, its a simple to learn game that challenges your previous score and let me tell you its not easy.Second, come on people, just look at the thumb nail, its not a 3d shoot em up game with graphics its a game to exercise your hand eye coo
__label__0 It just keeps going and going and going no real point to the app.not even worth reviewing except to keep anyone elese fromwaisting there time!!!
__label__1 I love this game. I do recommend! Its so fun! Download now! All you do is move your device back and fourth,but that's fun c:
__label__1 This game is awesome. Its so addictive and so tense. It make you so nervous that your going to lose.
__label__0 this game is not the real falldown from ipod/ipad its not the same at all do not get not fum or addicting
__label__1 Everyone should get this game it is really fun. I could play this game all day. This game is awesome!
__label__0 I was hoping for the classic falldown game that I used to love. At first I thought it was decent until I noticed that the app stimulation was jerky, and didn't run smoothly. Overall I was very disappointed
__label__0 i know this is probably stupid, but just by looming at the screen i can tell it is not the best game. it looks boring too. and it is
__label__1 I think you should really get this app because its really cool and fun. its really really good and educationally so try it you'll like it truss me.
__label__0 oh my goodness this app suuuuuuuuuuuucksss!!!!! the device does the game for you. do not get- do not get this horrid app!
__label__1 notice how all the three and under stars have horrible vocabulary, like good bad and ok?  well how about words like almost wonderful, horrible, and not horrible but not exquisite? - btw. I always get 100% on all my tests at school
__label__0 Hate it. Needs no skill to play. Where are the obstacles? Does the speed ever change? Does it get harder? No options?
__label__1 awesome wowoeowowowowowowows I luves. it hahamy brother I hats hate more than anyothing in the world n I don't
__label__1 This game is extremely addicting!!! I fell in love with it!!! Omg for a free game. AWESOME!! 20 characters yet?
__label__0 I'm so tired of just sitting there.All thee is is just stupid stuff and your just going back and fourth.BORING
__label__1 Addictive and fun games. As with most games, attention span for me is one week. And then I play once in a while. This game needs no manual, no reference cheat sheets. so I like the fact that this is simple and clean. My daughter enjoys it too.
__label__0 this game doesn't have any fun to it. I mean I got bored in just a second. They also need to make the levels shorter. I would not recomemd this game to anyone who likes REAL fun.
__label__0 The controls didn't work right on my galaxy tab, it acted like it was always tilted one way and wouldn't go the other way. Frustrating to say the least. otherwise it seems ok.
__label__1 I mean mantel it shut down my kindle and I had to wait for the battery to run down but most of the time it also
__label__1 I am giving this game five stars because everyone that has written a review can not spell for crap. Which means this game might be above their intelligence.
__label__0 Worst game I have ever played. Wast of time the ball falls super slow and the levels are freakishly long.
__label__0 ewwwww this game is awful. It put me to sleep. donor buy this lame exuse they call a game read the comments this game ducks.
__label__1 Sometimes it is nice to have an app where no thinking is required and anyone from the very young to the very old can play
__label__1 I loved it on my old ipod but unfortunately. it broke but then I got my kindle and Mt favorite game ever!!!!!!
__label__0 this game sucks so bad all you do is tilt it sometimes the tilt does not even work this game isn't worth your time
__label__1 I at first thought when I first saw the pictures of this game it was going to be one of those cheesy old time arcade games. but when I played it I fell in love with it. plz do get this app.
__label__0 when ever I go it always makes me force close the app and I cant play the app at all I try downloading again and it still doesn't work when I download the app again
__label__1 I first looked at the app reviews and one of them asked why it had four stars because they thought it was terrible.Then I saw a lot of other reviews about it being the best app ever, so I wasn't really sure what to exspect. Anyway, the app is fun and is 
__label__1 A very nice little draw/paint program. Even has an undo button, unlike a lot of free drawing programs.A good selection of brushes.If you want a nice little doodling program then give this a try.It would help if those who review Android apps would indicat
__label__0 It was an ok drawing app until it froze the background color.  It has the basic brush types (round, square, spray etc.) You can choose colors and sizes for your brush. However,  when I tried to change the background color it froze on the third color choi
__label__1 Even the kids have a good time with this one no matter how old they are. Take it to appointments with you. I guarentee you won'thave to wait. When ever you have something to do and aren't bored it seems like they take you in right away. Try it.
__label__1 this is agreat game i find myself stuck to it awesome its a great time saver i love it don't hate on this app
__label__0 When I tried it the first time I thought it is not hard so I was on the part where you have to press red white blue and green I pressed the colored letters and I lost but then I tried it a different yay and still did not work so I stopped playing this ga
__label__0 I dislike this app because it is not very funny.  It's not even to see if you are smart. I think any app would be better than this. Now you know why it's FREE.
__label__0 got past first level and then got stuck! no matter what I do, it doesn't let me past that question! don't wast time or memory on this thing! :/HOPEFULLY THIS WAS HELPFUL
__label__0 this game is so stupid! if u bother to get this.. u will regret it and delete. so don't get it and save 20 mins of your life.
__label__0 I only got this because I didn't want to spend money for the moron test. The game has almost all of the same questions as the Moron test, and it looks like these people did this on word 1997 there are no pictures or any background its just unapealing. Th
__label__1 I completed the game but it was very challenging. A game like this deserves 5 stars even though it was short.
__label__0 when I read the reviews I thought that cant be that bad but it is so don't get but nobody is going to stop you
__label__1 after the 6:45 clock don't press the arrow that says checkpoint instead look for the next written to the side of the screen in small letters press that and you go on to the next question which is not a repeat question I hope this was helpful
__label__0 This game is not fun at all!!!! After about 10 questions this was uninstalled. I think the Moron test is way better. I would rate this a zer0 if I could. Boringest game EVER!!!!!!!
__label__1 I finished the app so I know what to do. At the white screen were it says FINISH. Press it. I know it says that  u failed but it's a trick. On the right hand corner in red but really tiny it says FINISH.then u have finished the game. YOUR WELCOME
__label__0 This seems like its supposed to be good but its soooooooo not. pathetic copyoff of moron test (which is actually good. moron test, that is)
__label__0 The game is the same every time. There's 4 or 5 questions that you have to answer. You loose every time. I know  this because me and my sister did a test on it.
__label__0 I was playing this app and I acidently hit back and it made me restart so I did but then it kept saying I got the Answer wrong when I gave the same answer as before.Bad app. and as said before copy of Morin test.
__label__0 okay I know this might be really stupid and I am a loser soooo the first stupid question kept on calling me a loser.  I HATE THIS GAME SSSSSOOOOOO MUCH!!!!!!!
__label__1 I enjoy this app and i have no idea why so many people cannot figure it out. Yes, it takes some OBSERVATION of every screen you meet and maybe some patience, it is still possible to beat the game if you are smart enough. It will call you a dummy until yo
__label__0 It's. horrible! I didn't get it Cu's I read that it was a total ripoff. it's a copycat and boring game!! just remember that u not a moron or idiot or a loser cuz that game is a total lie and copier justso u no!!!!!
__label__0 THIS GAME SUCKS. ITS JUST A COPYCAT OR THE MORON AND STUPID TESTS. DON'T BUY IT ITS JUST A WASTE OF YOUR KINDLE SPACE
__label__1 How do the finish to finish is when it says loser there's a finish in the corner you wok n lol
__label__0 I played it until I got to the press number six page I couldn't get it it's also a copy of the first game the Moran test and the stupid test also its calls you loser if you fail!  Deleted it with a hour of use. Do not get this app
__label__1 So cool and funny is like your in funny town my life is so cool with this thing us ha
__label__1 this app is fun if you have nothing to do. i have beat this app so i decided to test my friends! this app will get you hooked and you wont want to stop until you beat it.
__label__0 this app is plain and a rip off of the moron test it just looks like something a child made AWFUL APP DO NOT DOWNLOAD UNLESS YOU LIKE STUPID GAMES thank you
__label__0 The game is interesting.... for five minutes. Then, you get a question wrong, it says &quot; LOSER! YOU FAIL!&quot; and then you have to start over. And when I say start over, I don't mean start the level over. I mean THE WHOLE GAME! then, you have to do
__label__1 This WIDGET is all I need........................................................)............... Get it it is a widget and not an ape I hope all the people that complain of not opening know how to operate a smart phone
__label__1 I use this app every day. It's a very convenient app since I keep it on my desktop. I highly recommend it.
__label__0 This app did nothing for me.  In fact, i deleted it pretty soon after installing it.  Sorry to the developer that i can't say anything positive.
__label__0 I got this because the icon says 76%, not rounded to the lower tenth, however the widget only shows remaining life in increments of ten. Very misleading.
__label__1 I keep the icon on my main home screen so I can easily control GPS and WIFI. Also shows what apps and tasks use the most battery.
__label__1 does exactly what it claims and is far more accurate than stock battery icon in the corner (galaxy tab). often my stock battery icon will show full battery all the way down to 80% or so but this shows you how much you actually have.
__label__1 This does what it promises to do and is a simple and small widget. Not sure why all the haters gotta hate, if you don't like the permissions then don't load the app. It works just fine for me!
__label__0 Installed it so i could have a visual as well as a numerical display of remaining battery but it doesn't refresh, i plugged my phone up to the charger and completely charged it but the widget showed it was still charging and only at 56%, uninstall lg est
__label__1 I know you can dig around in settings to find out the amount of battery remaining and what is using up your power. But to know your usage at a quick glance is beneficial. This does not tell you what is using up your power but will give you a snapshop of 
__label__1 Just what i needed.  i dont know why there is no option to display battery life percentage on the Android os.  the little green battery that changes to orange isnt very useful
__label__1 I've used this app in my last two smart phones. These new Smart phones take so much power and most times need recharging befor the end of the day. This app keeps you up to date on the battery status. Recommend to all.
__label__0 why does a battery indicator require my gps location how crazy is this bull crap if you think about it.
__label__0 This is the first app I've ever downloaded that I wasn't able to open in the year that I've had this phone. Lame. HTC Incredible 2.2 Froyo.
__label__0 not only does this application not work, but it occludes important safety issues surrounding xray use from the public, which is a real travesty. this app should be removdd from the app store
__label__1 SHOWED THESE TO FRIENDS MOST OF THEM GOT FOOLED BUT ONE ****** GUY CAUGHT THE TRICK LOL NICE FOOLIN APP.
__label__0 Did you even look at the description? &quot;Prank&quot; and &quot;joke&quot; doesn't make sense to you? Let me know when you decide to go back to kindergarten and learn to read.
__label__0 This was not as good as it appeared.  A waste of my time to download and navigate.  I deleted it as soon as I got it.
__label__0 I tried many ways to get it to work for me but it didnt. So I say that you should be careful getting it
__label__0 Why does this game have two stars overall? It should have on e it doesn't even move where u move it! Horrible game doesn't show my foot either!
__label__0 This app doesn't let you scan yourself. It's an app to prank your friends. When I talked to the creator of this app he said that he wanted an app that lets you prank your friends with an X-Ray. I asked him why didn't he make an app that actually works by
__label__0 Corny. Now I don't know how to uninstall it. Can someone help me please ? Kids might could fool each other once with it.I really dont want this on my phone. How do I get it off? No uninstall button.
__label__0 this app does nothing. it has no point and doesn't work. It is a waste of time and space! I recommend you don't get this app
__label__0 very poor quality, only 2 body parts to choose from. hard to scroll because of bad sensitivity to movement. needs work first then could be a three star app. evo 4g
__label__0 This is so lame I was pointing it at the ceiling then pressed left, and right foot,right hand, and left hand but it still showed the hand even though I wasn't pointing at it.
__label__0 Should have listened to the other reviews.  This is just plain dumb.  I can understand it's meant as a joke and it can't actually xray.  But it doesnt even pull that off properly.  Any time u spend downloading is just time you will never get back and wis
__label__0 I hate this app it's just a pic of a X-ray hand and that's it awful app :( awww man I have to keep writing done well bye
__label__0 When I tried to play it, it didn't even move. A waste of my space is all it is to me
__label__0 This app sucks OK so today is October 6 2013 Sunday and I broke my finger TuesdayOctober 1 and it still has not healed well it says my finger is perfectly fine. Oh and get this, xrayed my foot and it says there are three joints in my big toe m and I did 
__label__0 Not even a real app to tell you the truth. Its not worth anyone's time.I would delete this app from my memory if i could thats how bad it is.
__label__0 FYI we all read the description and we knew it was a prank app. I tried it on all my friends and NONE OF THEM FELL FOR IT. So yeah this app is defiantly not my favorite.
__label__0 RIP OFF. Don't think it's gonna scan anything. All it does is let you look at the foot or the hand. And it's some other persons hand or foot. Ok well just dont get it
__label__0 This app is only for entertainment. Plus it is a waste of time for using your Amazon coins for silly reasons to scan FAKE prints. This may be for children like -4 but otherwise, it's still, don't waste Amazon coinsStay cool :D
__label__0 well i haven't even tried it out yet but from all of yalls reviews i really don't know so wish me good luck!!!
__label__0 with all the bad reviews and having only one star, how can this possibly be in the top 100, let alone number 16. I don't get it.
__label__0 what kind of a crap game is this it sucks big time man DO NOT GET THIS GAME!!!!!!!? DEAD SERIOUS RETARDED. THIS DOESENT EVEN DESERVE ONE STAR
__label__1 Guys you think It is stupid. Wow. It is to prank your friends I mean read the description. First read description you think you guys are so cool judging an app make a better one then if you think this one sucks
__label__0 THIS app (says in the beginning)its an illusion not an actual xray scanner.also its for people to prank others and you can only pretend scan your right hand or left foot! talk about SUPER LAME..might wanna mention this application!!!
__label__1 Looks pretty fake, but it's actually kind of cool. More of a one time app. Not really going to go back to it much, since it's just a silly app.
__label__0 This is horrible.  The ads are so big you can't even play with it.  The graphics are fuzzy.  The calibration is a joke.  Just a poor app.  Even at free it is no good.
__label__0 its pretty weak... the calibration is off and it is just a waste of time. won't entertain anyone at a party. unbelievable. just plain sucks.
__label__0 IT DOES NOT WORK DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY WILL NOT SHOW U UR HAND WILL SHOW U A RANDOM X-RAY OF SOMEONE ELSE'S!!!!
__label__0 Unless I missed something, I don't find any practical use for this item except maybe have a laff or to.Not for me.
__label__0 This game Was not fast enough.  Did not like it, so didn't play it.  Nothing else to say on this subject.
__label__0 This isn't real and it really doesn't work so I say don't get this app it sucks like crap and I thought it would actually work
__label__1 i loaded it and pranked my geniuos son even. i am going to have fun with this one. takes about 5 mins of practice to mater all the tilting. i did it zig zaging like i was scanning. I even yelled yo hold still. lol
__label__0 Pointless. Not realistic at all. Nothing good to say about this one. I guess you have to be into this sort of thing.
__label__1 My kids love it. It is fun to play with. It would be better if it had kid size on it.
__label__0 This is the worst app ever all that you can do is scan your right foot or your right hand. I don't even think that was my hand. :(:(:(:(:(
__label__0 I just got this as interest.. it didn't last long and just wasnt that cool to play with so it is gone
__label__0 I tried to scan my hand and it is fake and my foot but it won't let me so I can scan my hand
__label__0 This app is a total waste of your time. The free version sucks just like the one for $.99. It's a rip off take my advice and don't waste your time
__label__0 It was horrible my 5 yr. old brother knew it was fake from the beginning...it moves.on its own I don't recommend.it
__label__0 I hate this app it the worst one in the world I wish I could remove it from all you good peaple it SSSSSUUUUUUUUCCCCCCKKKKKKKSSSSSS!!!!!!!!!!
__label__0 It sucks. How do you scan your hand? All it has is a picture of a hand and tilt it. Deleting it now. Never download it. It sucks.
__label__0 not worth downloadin. simple crap and not gonna convience your friends. doesnt show whole as shown photo. doesnt do as descibed. removd app within a minute from downloading
__label__0 it is a prank app that half the time you cant get into. DO NOT BUY, IT IS A WASTE OF STORAGE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
__label__0 was stupid and didn't work, my son downloaded this to try and he didn't even like it so we uninstalled it
__label__0 Not a X-ray A Scanner Just A Picture Of A Skeleton Hand With You Tilting Your Device Diffrent Ways To See More Of It Not Ya Hand In fact My Kindle Fire's Camra Was Looking At My Face It's A Rip Off Even Tho It's Free Because It Takes Up Space The Bought 
__label__0 Downloaded for a laugh, didn't think it would actually work (it doesn't, app even tells you on startup that its not real, which is fine). The problem is the calibration on the thing is off, I was tilting my phone all over the place and nothing was workin
__label__0 This game is boring and I don't recommend that you get this game. This game is super LAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Don't get this game!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Love Victoria
__label__0 slow startup, then once you select your options, the screen goes black and locked my phone up! had to remove battery. not a well written app.
__label__1 Dude its prank duuuhh read the description before u get this its good app to prank your friends ha ha ha ha ha aha ahaahaa yah its good

__label__1 I've had Sirius for years solely because of Radio Classics. My only complaint was cost and having to listen to the shows I didn't like. With this app, I not only get to the show I want immediately, but also the episode. Woohoo!
__label__1 I really enjoy go in back  in time when things were much simpler and the shows were a lot cleaner in humor.
__label__1 Old Time Radio Player is great! She asked me what we had if we didn't have television? Now she knows we listened to the radio. My mother fell in love with it but because she has an older model and different model, (Nook) she can't download it. I remember

__label__1 Love the old shows. Everything I remember, Lone Ranger, Dimension X, Mystery Theaters. Old yes, sound effects corney yes,  but the theater of the mind is the best. Loads quick, plays without interruptions.
__label__1 If you remember listening to these stories on the radio (for older people), They seem fresh again.  Yes, they are a lot hokey now, but they are entertaining.  Sure a long way from HD TV and the Internet that we have now, but still enjoyable.  Did people

__label__1 this is a good app but on the droid x the app will not show on the running app's list at the top of the screen when it is running.  If you are listening to a show and click on the home button the app will keep playing but you have to relaunch the app fro

__label__1 I found this app by accident and I love it. There are so many older stories and you can choose mystery, drama, and more for your story.  This app is a winner. Longest story I found was 45 minuets and in 3 parts. Some are less time.

__label__1 I love this the choices are great, drama, comedy film reenactments(lux radio theatre).It is great to have on when you are cleaning and the TV would be too distracting. The Crime dramas are really fun and the authentic old advertisements are a hoot!
__label__1 the only thing i miss about XM Radio is the old time radio shows. Now I have them on demand! thank you!
__label__1 Great app, but do you think you can make all the shows still play without wifi being on? Sometimes it gets frustrating when the wifi cuts off and it's in the middle of a good show. Other than that, love it.
__label__1 I really enjoy having these programs easily available while waiting at various malls and stores.  Nice interface and while I have thousand of shows on my computer, I don't have to take up space on my mini-tablet to store them.  Works great never crashes.

__label__1 love this, got the whole series of Mystery theater. Listen every night as I fall asleep. Some are a little grainy but still enjoyable.

__label__1 Have XM radio in the car while driving. Usually miss the ending. But with this I get the whole show while I relaxing and taking a shower..This is the best app I've ever had. Use while waiting for the doc and last week me and the doc listened to Dragnet. 
__label__1 I am not that old to remember these times but listening to how Abbott and Costello and Burns & Allen did this is great!  Technology has taken us far away from this, I am glad it is able to bring it back.  I enjoy this at night before I go to bed.

__label__1 Being a avid listener of old-time radio programs on XM Channel 82, I am happy this site is available as now I can listen when my XM isn't at hand.
__label__1 I love old movies and I really love old time radio shows. My parents told me a lot about the radio shows and they were not lying. Each episode comes thru crystal clear. What a way to kick back and relax.

__label__1 my husband likes it. He's a news junkie and likes to check all the news sources for the most current updates.
__label__1 I chose this rating because I enjoy reading about the news. Now that I have the tablet. I can read the news at any time. As long as I am not driving. I would recommend both the tablet and app. to everyone that does not have one.
__label__1 It's a nice app to have.  I wish there was an app for the CBS weather like I do have for my iPhone.
__label__1 Good morning my love for you you are a lot lot of people people in the next few months ago later this week so I can do that that to you
__label__1 GREAT...  love all the news casters and their stories of people doing great things,  the round the world news is great too.

__label__1 [[ASIN:B004SYNIJ4 CBS News] I love this! There are pages of headlines and pictures.... then if you want to read about the news, it is great! I think there is video on there also, but I just got it and was sampling it last night. If you live for news of a
__label__0 Now it is useless. Loved this app. Used it all the time. I am removing it. Are u in such a need of money from ads? Ads cover almost all of the page, impossible to read news. much worse than anoying. Shame!
__label__1 I love my CBS broadcast news. Don`t get me wrong i also like cable news, but there is nothing like good old fashion broadcast news (maybe i am just old) but i like what i like and i like broadcast news, so there. This app gives me all i need from CBS New
__label__1 Great source of information when you are on the go. Accurate weather updates like the broadcasters and overall appearance of show.

__label__1 Thanks, works great
__label__0 since you do not provide local news then you have no excuse to try to track my location. you can bugger off. I will use other applications that are not so invasive, thank you.
__label__0 K, so you want to have a CBS.com app.  So did I, but this CBS news app is just plain dumb.  Do I really want to rewatch propaganda mainstream news on my tablet?  I think not, so I uninstalled it.  I'm waiting for the real CBS.com app to show up so I can 
__label__1 Good way to do a quick check of what's happening.Well done layout for news items.Wish all the news was better but it is what it is.
__label__0 Each time I selected a video, the app crashed and closed. Going to delete until a fix is found. Will watch CNN instead.

__label__1 Finally someone gets it right. This is a nice app if your a person like myself who is very busy.  Sometimes a little too busy to bother with little things like due dates that appear once a month on a piece of paper, that is often mixed with junk mail. Th
__label__1 very helpful. I would not remember to pay my bills without it.I have add. its a life saver. get it!
__label__0 funny how all my reviews get erased but the creator can write a ton of 5 stars for him/her self. this app does nothing more than a recurring reminder on the built in calendar that comes with the phone. done end of discussion.

__label__0 this is the second time amazon offered this app as the free app of the day, the first time it was called &quot;easy money&quot;, it is still in my apps list, I tried both apps and they are almost identical... come on amazon, can't you see that Handy Apps
__label__1 There is a camera feature in the program that allows you to take pictures for your records. If you look through the screenshots you will see it. Thus the camera permissions. I keep my camera's lens covered until I need to use it so I understand the need 
__label__1 great app.  never forget a bill due date again and know what you owe in a second.  makes my life easier.  and isn't that what we all want.
__label__1 I already bought this last year and started to use it. It is a pretty good app that is basic and simple, not too complicated to where it is a hassle just to input things. I still have the app but it became much easier to use the Pageonce and Mint apps. U
__label__0 Don't waste your time with purchasing this app! I removed it three days after my purchase and wont touch it again.

__label__1 this is just what I needed to stay on top of bills.  I love the simplicity and ease of use.  nothing fancy but that's. not what I wanted.
__label__1 Works as promised.  Keeps me mindful of all bills I have coming up. One of the more important app in my collection.
__label__1 I cannot really find anything wrong with this app. It's really easy and straight forward to use. I had no problems setting up my reminders and it keeps reminding me until I select 'paid' which is great for me because I tend to put things off and then for
__label__1 This app is a life saver and I simply love it- no complaints! I would definately recommend it if you haven't tried it already. I'm glad I got it while it was free cuz I got to try it and I don't regret it.
__label__1 This is a very useful app. It gives me a quick overview of all of my finances. Once you get the hang of it, it is easy to add,  edit,  or delete information.
__label__1 I do not use automatic bill pay for credit cards so need this reminder  to make sure I pay on time.  great app.
__label__0 the moment i click on due date, it crashes. can't even use it. regularcalendar is more reliable. and once it crashed, the Amazon app store app shows this app needs to be reinstalled. the due date shows 2012null3null12null, maybe tech can see this to fix 
__label__1 this bill organization app is so simple its funny! it keeps a simple single list of bills that are due shortly and allows you to pick an advanced reminder time as well. it is the perfect simple organizor that everyone can use. perfect!
__label__1 This bill reminder app is the best. I can store my bills and have them recur every month. They also have a reminder feature so you do not miss paying your bills. Love it!!
__label__1 Works like it says it will.  I'm very happy with it. Would recommend to anyone trying to keep on top of bill paying.
__label__0 For each bill I entered I receivednot one, but four and five alerts at a time. Even after I marked bills paid, I continued to get overdue alerts. I installed it.
__label__1 This particular app is very useful.  It is easy to use and accomplishes just what I need.  Straight forward...what you see is what you get.
__label__1 With this simple app you can input all your monthly bills, set them to repeat, and even set reminders if you want to. I'm a busy man with a busy schedule. Come pay day life is a little bit hectic and it's hard to remember exactly WHAT needs to be paid, W

__label__1 I almost didnt download this app but I love  it works just fine for me. I love the reminders ;Its a must have
__label__1 I like how well organized it is for how inexpensive it was.  It so easy to customize the catagories.  Every element of keeping a general file on a bill or payment is there.  I love using it.
__label__1 OMG.....This app is the best thing I could have ever gotten. It is extreemly easy to use.....just put in all your reccouring bills and income.....not only does it keep track of your due dates and remind you that there. homing up.  It also shows you how m

__label__1 for real adults that have real bills. it works great on my kindle fire. for you kids that want to give it a bad rating just because you don't have bills and its not a stupid game, why bother to leave any feedback at all? move on.
__label__0 my first entry was for a regular income. I marked it as income. I set it to repeat every 2 weeks. after saving, I went back to view it and not only did it appear as a payable, but the next repeat date was 2 YEARS out. not at all how I entered the informa
__label__1 It was not too difficult to learn the interface to this app. It's attractive and functions well. I like that the Icon doesn't give away the true nature of the app in case of prying eyes. Once I had it properly set up, and, yes, there is a wee bit of a le
__label__1 I have several different kinds of calendering systems, but this one has insured that I never forget when a bill is due.  When it sends a reminder, I know to pay the bill, it is that simple.
__label__0 I purchased this from Amazon. Has worked great until I had to reset my phone.I depend on this app and it has now failed me. I can get it installed but it won't let me restore s backup file. It also force closes when I try to add an entry to start over.Pl
__label__1 This application has been a great help to me to remind me what bills I have and when they agree due.
__label__1 Easy to add bills, simple UI allowing users to manage all their bills at a glance, reminder timers for multiple says out help.
__label__1 This APP does what I need - reminds me so that I won't be late.  Very pleased!  I use the monthly reminder most of all.
__label__1 I like this app so far because it appears to be very simple and efficient at reminding you to pay your bills. I track all my due dates on my calendar, with reminders, but the drawback there is that I don't always know if I have paid a bill already or not
__label__1 There have been several times when I received a bill late or not at all. If not for this app my payment would have been late.  Also makes budgeting easier.
__label__1 A great app that does what it says. For those with reading comprehension problems, the camera permissions are clearly explained in the description. You can take a photo to be included in the reminder. There are no communication permissions so it can't se
__label__1 this app I use on my kindle fire and helps me so much. me and my finance are just living. on our own. for the first time and it really hepls us know where we stand financially.

__label__1 So far this app is doing what it says it does. Easier for me to use instead of keeping track of my bills on a notepad. It free so try it.
__label__1 nice app and at least it isnt a 3yr old's theme game! like it a lot. you should download and try it at least once guys
__label__1 Who needs an app to remind them the rent is due? That's what moms are for. When my rent is due, my mom just hollers down the stairs and reminds me.
__label__1 this is a nice little device for those who have a bad memory. it helps me remember when my bills are due.
__label__1 The app is obviously a good idea. I know this, not from experience, but because I can use my brain. Not everyone pays a single rent, cable, and cell bill once a month, like me. I know that there are people out there with more than three bills. Some peopl
__label__1 This app is another great app by Handy Apps.Works well and is easy to use.I only wish there was an online snyced version to use as a alternitive.
__label__1 This app helps me keep up with my bills, paychecks, and money owed to me or anyone else. It works great with the kindle fire. I highly recommend this app for people who like to be neat and reminded.
__label__1 Since my mom cant remind me &amp; I'm not in jail...I occassionally need a reminder w/dealing w/work, home &amp; kids &amp; their activities. Nice app but it does need a quarterly bill reminder &amp; a bi-weekly income entry. Cant enter income since both
__label__1 Aside from a few glitches (deleted bill reminders still showing up months later) this is a great little app.  When my computer stopped working a few months ago I lost access to my Quicken bill reminders and this app saved me a lot of hassle and potential
__label__1 This does not have tons of bells and whistles but it gets the job done. I got tired of having bills drafted out of my account and having them bounce for one stupid reason or another (my fault, of course) so I started manually paying my bills again like i
__label__0 I couldn't even play the game because it showed up too tiny on my kindle. would not recommend it to any one.
__label__1 My son loves the game and enjoys playing this game on the ipad.  He also likes the timing feature on the game.
__label__1 This is my favorite checkers game.  It is very challenging and fun to play. I would purchase from Bluesky Studio again.
__label__1 this is an amazing app!  I bought it almost a year ago...happy 2 pay full price because of the quality! I have never even noticed &quot;in-app purchases&quot; because I was 2 busy creating pottery! the point of the entire game is to make pottery &amp; se
__label__1 lol suckas if u want it dnt buy it for the money buy it when it freeeeeeeeee! stupid.god dont say it sucks unless u pay and dont pay just w8 for ir to be free!
__label__1 this is a really fun game get it if you don't like it you don't No what fun apps are get it get it
__label__1 Don't support greedy devs who trick there customers into buying full game then wiping it out and adding IAP to the game.
__label__1 One word: Great!!!! I don't know why its getting hatred reviews... I have the free app of the day because of prime, so I got it free. It works good on the Kindle Fire. Its not a rip off.
__label__1 Look I got the update and I don't care about it and you guys can whine all ya want but all it is/is pure gold!!!!
__label__1 Even my 5 year old is enjoying this. She is getting a kick out of selling her pots and seeing if she makes more coins than mine do. I've been playing this off and on for a few hours and haven't seen anywhere that I need to pay money to purchase stuff. It
__label__1 If you like to be creative and also be  challenged to match shape size and color of interesting pottery designs.or make your own custome designs you will enjoy this app. well worth the money for app an any brush packs you may add on
__label__1 I loved this game way back on iOS. When I gave up the Apple ecosystem, I thought I'd be losing this app and was so happy to find it for Android (Kindle Fire in particular!).I have restarted the game many times; saving up points to repurchase paint &amp; 
__label__1 i love this app! saw it awhile back and snagged it when it was free. very fun game to play as well as just be creative. i've been playing with it for hours since i downloaded it.
__label__1 I love this app so much I've been playing for 4 hours straight. I enjoy every aspect of this game.
__label__1 this app is very addicting and relaxing.  it is nice to just be able to be creative.  the graphics are wonderful.  it makes me want to take a pottery class.  I wish there were more apps like this one.  I showed it to my mom and now she wants a kindle fir
__label__1 This game is a lot of fun, very relaxing, and lets your creativity flow.  The possibilities are endless.  I highly encourage you to try it if you are looking for a self paced game
__label__0 Unacceptable to have IAP's in a premium app. Don't support that. Tell these devs no with your wallet because that's the only way they'll understand.
__label__0 After reading some of the reviews of people whom have spent 5 full dollars initially for their game, only to find out that the update changed their premium game to play-to-win format is just plain wrong. I understand that companies need to earn money, bu
__label__1 After seeing all the 1-star reviews I got curious, so I thought I 'd give it a try anyway...it's free right. It's. fun and I'm not sure what everyone else is referring to when saint there are other money transactions. I've. been playing it for a little o
__label__0 Do not try to sell an app as worth $5 and then require more in app money to be able fully enjoy it.
__label__0 I don't mind IAPs when the app is free and the IAPs give an advantage, but not when the IAP required to complete out unlock everything. Then on top of that, this game isn't free.
__label__0 These devs are only out to rip people off. I feel for those that paid full price for this only to have their time investment taken away. Don't support these scumbags.
__label__0 terrible in app purchase.  if the program uses Iap then it should be free.  and it should tell you up front what and how much the iap.
__label__1 If you like creativity buy this. its fantastic and very addictivenalso it has a very good game pace. I strongly recomment it
__label__1 My son enjoys this app immensely.  I do as well.  We love to create all different kinds of pottery shapes and see how much we can 'sell ' them for.
__label__1 &quot; Let's create pottery &quot; is not a bad game at all... I don't know what you people are saying but whatever it is... it is weird because my cousin has the free version on her IPhone4 and its great! the Icon is even there.
__label__0 I haven't even bought this app yet but it sucks .what ever you do do not buy this app. for yore safty
__label__1 Okay loved the app, thought that it worked great on kindle fire.............................................................................. I don't know why no one would like this.
__label__1 This is by far the best free app ever! Stop hating cuz you don't know how to play it. It is AWESOME! I love it. My favorite app.
__label__0 this is horrid why would u pay 4.99 ot was for free but really woot woot its a pot its not like u can take it out of the stern and keep the thing SO GUESS WAT I STICK MY TOUNGE OUT AT THIS GAME BOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!
__label__1 please calm down everyone. this game is amazingly fun. I haven't even seen any aip's in this game at all yet. if you got this game for free like me, you shouldn't be complaining. the graphics and gameplay are terrific. :D
__label__0 I THOUGHT THIS GAME WOULD B FUN AND CRAFTY  BUT WHEN I GOT THE GAME AND IT WAS INSTALLING IF FROZE AT 60% NOW ITS STUCK THERE!!
__label__0 Interesting activity-type game. But adding In App Purchases to an already high priced game is absurd. It's a shame that these bait and switch "free paid app" cons keep slipping through.
__label__1 I love all pottery and this game is awesome I love it I'm really good at it I love pottery :-)
__label__1 Shame on those who don't like this game.  Quality game with good graphics but a bit over priced.-Whales CEO and director of written reviewsc. November 2012[...]
__label__1 I love this app its great and its like real pottery making I love it I think you should to
__label__1 I don't get why so many negative reviews.  The choice to spend money is yours.  When your creations are auctioned off,  you receive &quot;money&quot; that can be used to purchase paint,  brushes,  etc. If someone is dumb enough to spend real money on suc
__label__1 This game is probably the best game I have ever played on my tablet. From looking at the cover I didn't really pull me in, but don't judge a book by its cover.
__label__1 This game is simple, creative and fun. This is good for kids to learn better motor control. Also, it helps with creativity. Fun for adults too. It is very stress relieving. I wouldn't suggest buying this if you want something action packed. This is more 
__label__1 Better than most time-wasters. This one will help you appreciate the finer things in life. It kept my wife, my son, my daughter, occupied for a concert I was enjoying, but they were tuning out!
__label__0 This app is set at a premium price, $5, then the dev wants to make money off of in app purchases!? Infinite Dreams gives developers a bad name!
__label__1 I. downloaded this app for my kindle fire when it was the free download of the day and I love it! It's fun and creative but also relaxing. I also purchased the .99 add-on packs to have more design options. If you like to create I would definately reccome
__label__0 I cant believe it!!! I downloaded this app when it said it was free and then it took one whole day to install and then the next day it said it was $5 and they made me pay and I didn't like the app at all! and my kindle isn't slow to install anything at a
__label__0 Just one more developer looking to bilk consumers out of money to feed their truly selfish desires.  If you want to put people like this out of business, send them a message by not spending additional money on their products.  This will force them to mak

__label__1 This game is fun and worth the 5 bucks. I bought it and I got color and had no problems it is addicting and fun. I recommend this app. From Austin
__label__1 fun game that keeps you occupied. My whole family loves it and it is very fun to create crazy pots :)
__label__1 This is the funnest and Greatest Apps i have tryed so far. The downside is it's $4.99. but to me it's so worth it to see what you can create and see how much you can sell it for. it's a must buy! dont listen to the other comments, cause im telling you th

__label__0 You should be ashamed. Although it's clear you have no morals and are unable to feel shame. I too will avoid your apps from now on; you've been added to the list.
__label__0 You can't do anything but shape clay on the wheel and fire it. You have to buy everything else to decorate it. Total rip off!!!!!!
__label__1 I don't  know why everyone hates this game it's  awesome not bad. i don't  get why you can't  just get everything with the game though.
__label__0 This game was fun at first. But when I was making my 3rd pot, my kindle suddenly froze. I had completely restart my kindle. If this is fixed, the game is really fun and I will give it 5 stars!
__label__1 This game is wonderful even better since I got it free during app of the day I highly recommend this!
__label__0 So many people have ready said it... IAP for paid app is just ridiculous...especially when said app is $5! And from what I've read this dev has one of those tricky tricky business models that sold this app as premium with all content and then pulled an u
__label__1 I have seen this game from infinite dreams for some time now,  but the $4.99 price was kept me away. For a FAOTD this was a great surprise! I haven't set down my phone since I downloaded this game. Make a piece,  sell it,  and buy more colors and materia
__label__0 After reading many reviews on how this app was first sold (honestly, I find it truly hard to believe that anyone would pay $5 for an app,) and then converted to an IAP game, I won't purchase it, even for &quot;free.&quot; I did consider getting this for 
__label__1 But Infinite Dreams needs to update it and add more because they've lost their base fans.  Most people aren't going to pay $5 for an app.  I see a lot of opportunity to work around that.  Even though everyone will complain about ads there's a better chan
__label__0 The product description states explicitly that there are real money spending options in this app. And that parents can limit & control that through menu settings. NO such menu is accessible from within this app's menu on a Kindle Fire! So be forewarned y
__label__1 I fell in love with this app over a year ago on my ipod and I am so happy it works great on my Kindle Fire! I also love being able to post my creations on to my Idreams community page so even after I sell them I still have them and can show them off!! GR
__label__1 I LOVE THIS! it is so unique! there are always things to do! there are quests that give you inspiration when youve run out! its like nothing else ive ever played! i am so glad that i got this when it was free, but it is worth the money others have to pay
__label__0 Here we go again, more and more greedy developers everyday. Why would anyone sell you anything incomplete is just wrong. Charge one fee and make both you and the buyer happy. Greed is evil!! Not recommending this app to anyone and i hope your ratings go 
__label__0 I have never understood companies that rip off their customers. You pay $5.00 for an application (which is the beginning of the higher end cost for apps), then REMOVE features and try to get the customers to pay even more money!I'll go out on a short lim
__label__1 This was a wonderful free app of the day. I have seen some reviews that you may have posted and I found out how to paint the pot and add decorations. Paint: Slide your finger up and down the pot. Slide it on the same spot again to make it darker. Brushes
__label__1 This game is one of my favorites really it is so if u like creating unique and cool pottery this is for you! I would definetly not listen to the haters this game is 1 everybody should get! 5 stars
__label__0 I could not open it. You can do it for real in the first place. I think it was very stupid. Please do not get this app it is not worth it at all.
__label__1 This game is great for future artists. People who enjoy pottery will really like this game. As you sell more pots and earn more money, you can unlock more.
__label__1 this app is amazing me and my mom fight over who gets to play it next and whoever put a bad reveiw don't listen I garenty if you buy this app u will love it!!
__label__1 it'fun because u make a shape and disinit and Colorado it and sell it or kept it in your colletion
__label__1 omg this game  is so awesome i have it on my kindle fire i got it for free trial on my kf and it is awesome i reccomend it!!!!!!
__label__0 Really? Again? In app purchases? Here let me give you a star and feel free to use it as a suppository.
__label__1 I thought I'd hate it, but since it was featured as a free app today, I snagged it. I probably wouldn't pay for it, but it is incredibly fun. I can't put it down. I can see myself purchasing the add-ons though. It makes me want to make real pottery.To pe
__label__1 This is a pretty robust app that can be played in relatively short bursts. I don't plan on using the in app purchases and haven't needed to. anyone complaining about IAP has obviously not tried the game at all and has no concept of how developing and mar
__label__1 totally fun! I don't even know how to get the in app purchases but this app works fine without it
__label__1 I like this app. It is fun to play and very relaxing. I have finished the app twice, and am waiting for an update.
__label__0 This review is just to balance out the fake 5-star reviews put on by the greedy devs. But then, a $5 app which wants you to keep spending even more in-app deserves zero stars.
__label__1 I think that this game is the best game that's ever been invented and I love this game and I play it everyday
__label__0 In app purchase on a 4.99 application.Are you serious? Plus an application to create pottery. Again, are you serious?People must have more money than brains to be shelling out 5 Buck for this crap.
__label__0 Give all the content, rake in 5 star reviews, wait until sales get low, then zoom in and change the content to premium, all the while laughing at customers who were sucked into the scheme. And you get to kiss your 5 dollars goodbye or pay out som more fo
__label__0 this app is another exapmle of greedy developers.  I had this app and had acquired in game materials. .well then the update caused all my stuff to dissapear and the app was telling me I had to use real money to buy the stuff I already had!  fail
__label__0 $5 to virtually create an ash tray? I'm sure some people may enjoy this app and more power to them but what's next virtual baths?
__label__1 I got this app on my kindle fire and it works great. I didn't have any problems or glitches or anything. its pricey but I think its worth it for the hours of fun it gave me.
__label__1 I grabbed this as the faotd a while back, and I don't regret it at all. I enjoy the game as a way to relax, and be creative at the same time.My 4 year old loves this game too, and creates some amazing stuff. The only complaint I have is that my 4 year ol
__label__1 I think that this app is great. It is very fun for people who love art. It also gives you a lot of selections of how you want to create your pottery. Get this app it is great. (Written by my granddaughter)
__label__1 this game is so fun u need to get this game now I got this game for free but if I didn't then I would still pay 5dollars for this game this game is great
__label__1 this game is a very good time killer and it is very. fun!!! you should get it because it gets your imagination out!
__label__1 its so much fun its like u have ur own pottery business don't listen to the bad reviews get it.
__label__0 Just because its going to premier as FAOTD does not mean that you must cripple your app's rating by charging more. Treat a FAOTD as a time to get people to try your app and raise your rating. Think of the future not the present. Now no one will buy your 
__label__1 I love potery so now i dont have to waite so long for it to come out and i can be me. it may seam like a wast of money and time but it is fun when yu play it alot.
__label__0 it is annoying sell the app for more money then don't sell for 4.99 then raping customers for more money afterwards
__label__1 I don't see anything wrong with this game. So I don't know what's up with everyone saying crap about it. I love it. Its very addicting and it sure does kill time.
__label__1 I love this app so much its so fun I play it every night!! you got to get this!! what this app is about you make pottery!! you make the shape then you color it and more!!!!
__label__1 It is so exciting to create pottery that you wouldn't go out and do. The option to sell it is awesome. What a great, fun pass time.
__label__1 What a fun, relaxing and entertaining activity this is.  I am so tired of all the hack n slash, tower defense, city builder, match three, hidden object, boring word games, games that offer no creative challenge, no opportunity to stretch your imagination
__label__1 I really don't understand the IPA hate. It doesn't make the game any less fun, and that's what a review is about. This game makes incredible use of the touch screen. It can be as simple or complex as you'd like it to be. It actually got me interested in 
__label__0 Started Out Free Then This App Stopped Working.. Said I Need To LOg In To Amazon To Fix. ThenI Seen That They Are Making You Pay To Play...  Even If You Unlocked Items...  Idiotic Business Model.. Way To You Customers Off And Get A Bad Rep.  I Let My 4 Y
__label__1 I don't know what problems everyone else is complaining about, but I love the game. Cute concept and fun to play. Not too hard and not too easy. If you don't want to spend real money on the IAP, then don't. Duh.
__label__1 So far the app is pretty good and ranks between a 4 and 5 star app. When and if I find the In App Purchases I will no longer use the app and delete it from my Kindle Fire. Asking for $4.99 for a game and then pushing IAPs is uncalled for and I do not end
__label__1 I have NOT... I REPEAT HAVE NOT had to use my own money at all with this game. You can make pots on your own and then sell them , or follow what the characters ask you to make.The game/app does what it says it does and bonus it does it WITHOUT spending y
__label__1 i didnt expect much from this but it has totally exceeded my expectations. great pottery game! great graphics, fun unlock system.
__label__0 Fun game - Yes. Good idea - Yes. Worth $5 - Nope. Worth $5 + more $$ to actually design your pots without having to make dozen of bland ones before you can - Worst idea EVER. Its like going to a restaurant, ordering an expensive steak dish, then tell you
__label__0 Not sure why an app that requires in app payment to play is considered a free app of the day.  It's sad when they start the description out with the disclaimer... Stop letting them get away with this model people!  You're telling them it is okay when you
__label__1 This is one of the greatest art app I have come across,  It enables you to use your creative imagaination. I can spend hours make pottery, coloring them and addding designs.  I wish there weremore designs and themes available.
__label__1 Okay, some of us are just not gamers, we're creators.  I got this when it was the faotd and was hooked right away.  You don't have to buy a single thing.  As you create, you "sell" your work to earn "money" to buy the items that you need.  You don't ever
__label__1 fudge turds yummy !!!!!!! I love you fudge turds!!! mmmm hmmmmFUDGE TURDS!!!! OH YEAH BABBBBY!!!YAY FUDGE TURDS FOR DIN DIN!!!yummy.ohyeah
__label__1 you do not need to spend any real money on anything at any time.  I have actually played the game all day unlike so many childish people that reviewed the game based on what others said without even downloading it let alone playing it.  if you have never
__label__0 My grandson loves this game, downloaded when it was the app of the day. He gave me his 99&cent; to buy the polish design brushes today, and I was so angry that he then had to purchase them again with in game money. Really? How greedy can you get? So tire
__label__1 this app is amazing. although the other reviews say that it is such a bad app its really not. yes I agree it is more of a hobby but still wither way it is really fun.
__label__0 So, normally this app is $5. and even after paying for it, you STILL have to pay even more REAL CASH to obtain items to play.  IAP's are the scourge of our time and we need to come together and boycott them  ALL! STAY AWAY!!
__label__0 This is less of a game and more of an activity. That being said, its a fairly enjoyable way to kill off some time on a lazy afternoon. Making the pottery allows you to tap into your creative side, and, tho the actual modifications you can make to the pot
__label__0 I cannot post the creations I made and as I bought all the patterns and extra colors(which should have been included)I am very disappointed. I cannot even sign onto the site for help. I recommend that you do not waste your money like I did. Have been wai
__label__0 welll I never played this game but seems really dumb. I mean read the reveiws u would think y does this game Evan exist.  like really if you don't follow me my saying I would never under stand u&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;SO HALURRRRRRRRR WAKE UP SMELL THE F
__label__0 Unlike others here, I didn't pay $5 for the original version. Instead, I got it as the faotd and used the in-app purchasing to get some upgrades. Guess what? New phone = no upgrades and no way to restore them.  I don't mind HONEST in-app purchases, but t
__label__0 They want a super premium price, then want you to pay more to use it?  Sorry, don't think so.  This developer is on my list of those I will never buy an app from again.  Stop supporting these scammers.Refuse to buy from devs that do this.
__label__1 This app has to honestly be the best app I've ever seen.  It's so affordable &amp; the possibilities are endless. I absolutely love it. I've had hours of fun. Definitely worth downloading. You won't regret it.
__label__1 Let me say first, that I think it is rotten that people have lost their work and I hope the company is going to do something about that.With that said, I played this all day. It's not difficult to figure out, but it is challenging. It is fun and I am rea
__label__1 This app is so cool. I would definitely rate this 5 stars. It allows you to be creative, and colorful. I love this app. Though, there is one thing that I don't like. One day, I was messing around with the languages before I realized that the app doesn't 
__label__0 I can't believe the developers would have the audacity to charge five bucks for their app and then nickel and dime people for additional money as they go through the game. Sure, today it's being offered for free, but you couldn't PAY me to download it ri
__label__1 This is such a fun and entertaining app. especially for kids. They love it!! But for an adult its easily accomplished.
__label__1 I was gonna buy this on my 3ds a couple weeks ago. So glad I waited! As far as the IAPs...I've been playing for a couple hours &amp; have yet to see anything to buy. You create your pottery. From start to finish everything...sculpting, painting, etc. wor
__label__1 I have had a lot of fun with this app my brothers and I are constantly bragging to each other on how much money we got on a piece of pottery although I do agree with others that 5 dollars is a little much its a fun and slightly challenging game to play a
__label__1 I don't see what is wrong with this game this is my favorite game Ever! It is fun designing pots and seeing how much their worth
__label__1 I liv this game it is very.entertaining it is a great time killer the only complaint is that I cant send my pictures of my pottery with my email hey wanna know my email?
__label__1 For those of you thinking about getting this app.... I'd like to correct some bad information ....There are NO IAP... I've looked (hard) to find them after all the bad reviews ... the don't exist. Yes, this is on the more expensive side, but there aren't
__label__1 it used to be free now it is FIVE DOLLARS are u kidding me i saw it one day it was free i was gonna get it the next and it was five dollars  so i am mad
__label__0 The update eliminated ALL previous work and NOW it still costs $5 but you can't get all of your upgrades through "$5-play." You have to pay MORE for this??This is an app that lets you create pottery through a simple touch screen "swiping" method from the
__label__0 Okay Amazon, enough with the free apps then supporting greedy devs which use in app purchases.  I'm about to give up on the Amazon App store because of this.
__label__1 Ok so I work at a elementary school and we let the kids play on the ipads every once in a while. The kids LOVE this app. It is great for creating and getting used to the electronic. It's worth the $5. The only disadvantage is some glitches and force clos
__label__1 best game ever play every time I see him moo moo moo moo moo moo moo moo moo moo moo
__label__1 I've played this game through several levels and I find it challenging and interesting. No need to buy any content so far.. ...
__label__1 Great Game !!!! Lots of pots to make ! Very fun.  YourAble To Make cups from Coffee Cups to jars To FoodBowls.
__label__0 We HAVE to boycott IAP! Scamming us out of even more money in game . . . Don't think so!
__label__1 IAP does not always equal bad. There are TONS of games out there that offer the option to pay real money to get things. You know why? Because people are lazy, and would rather spend some pocket change to get it rather than work their way through the game
__label__1 I have no idea what the negitive reviews are about. I got this for free and I think its great.There is an Option to buy added tools later in the game, but so what. Its fun, there's no time limit,and no mess. Great App!
__label__0 Send your creations to other people?  Really?  Maybe if you made a real pot in grammar school, then your mom would cherish and keep it.  Sending mom a crummy ePot instead of visiting her on mothers day isn't going to earn you any points.
__label__1 I got this app for my kindle fire and haven't run into any problems.  I love it. My younger sister and brother love this app. He literally begs me to play it. I haven't had to spend real money. I haven't even been offered the chance to spend real money. 
__label__0 Shameful greed going on here. Okay so maybe you can use this app without using IAP, but it's just the thought of $5 plus IAP that smells of greed. Oh and the Urban Airship module=shame on you too!This app was very boring and very sub par for an Infinite 
__label__1 We've been playing all day.  Love it!  Great on the fire, and never needed to buy anymore.  Good job, dev.
__label__1 ...Really guys? This app is brilliant! With the update that some people were complaining about, it works perfectly fine for me, and I have a Kindle Fire!The displays are brilliant, the features are sensitive, which is great, and the remarkable results ar
__label__1 There are a lot of warnings saying don't upgrade this to use real money.  So just leave it as is and you will be fine.  It has kept the granddaughter going for 2 days so far.  She has learned how to email her creations so now I get email from her.  It wa
__label__1 all you idiots who said it was based on iaps are wrong, haven't found one yet, the games currency is coins, but not real coinage, anyway AWSOME game
__label__1 I've been waiting patiently and finally an app that offers me a chance to add more to my pottery experience with IAPs.
__label__0 This game is pretty poor.  It stinks that the pay version has IAPs.  Its also very repetive and boring.  I do not recommend.
__label__1 I love how this works on my kindle fire..... this is fun and I love making new designers for my pots. I also like how you don't spend real money.You earn it in the game by selling you're pots.....
__label__1 Ok I love this game it's so fun and now well I'm pottery crazy. It's so real looking and you get to order it and make it come to life !!
__label__1 First of all, I've plenty of fun with this game and haven't spent a penny of my real money.  It's sort of a 3D puzzler where you recreate pottery based on pictures sent with orders from customers.  It's easy enough so it doesn't get to be frustrating, bu
__label__0 This appear normally costs five bucks but then they dun you for more after purchase.  That's just greedy, and should not be encouraged.
__label__0 Here we go, another game with In App Purchases!  And it's free, but wait, that means it's never free doesn't it? And to think the regular price is $4.99. What a joke! I can't believe anyone would actually pay for this game and then pay more for extra stu
__label__1 I absolutely love this app.  The in app purchases are completely optional.  The app is very cool, and very addicting!  Although, I got this app when it was the FAOTD, I would recommend it but I wouldn't buy it for the $4.99 price.  Of course, I probably 
__label__1 My eight year old grand daughter put this on my Kindle recently. At first I was not impressed, but she wanted it.  When she started creating all these beautiful pottery pieces and them selling them I was blown away. Not only at how artistic and creative 
__label__1 I'm really enjoying this app so far. It works fine on my Kindle Fire, and I haven't encountered any IAPs yet. It might not be worth $5, but luckily it was the FAOTD. Thanks Amazon!
__label__1 Yes, this app allows you to purchase additional brushes if you choose to do so. HOWEVER, there is TONS of free content in this game and you don't need to pay to play for hours.There are a ton of challenges that use the content already in the game. I've b
__label__0 the app sucks. boring!!!!!!!! don't buy this app.  I would rate it a 0 if I could I m a 14 year old boy loo king for sum fun and this is not it
__label__0 Didn't get to try it, but once I installed it it started sending notifications to notification bar and adds. It does it very persistently too.  Guess I won't be getting to the IAPs haha. Too bad, looked like it would have been fun.
__label__0 After reading the reviews for this app Im sorry to say that I wouldn't be dl this at all. Inap purchases completely turn me off .. Even though it's a "free" app today it's not going to be free in the long run. After someone stated that inbox request stop
__label__1 I wasn't sure about this app at first, but after downloading &amp; playing it fir a while it is better than I thought. If u like to create things &amp; if u can imagine how something would look; then u should get this app.
__label__1 just draw and you have a masterpiece. Never can make mistakes. A great app for big and little people. Thanks
__label__1 I think this game is very fun, addicting and actually quite relaxing. I enjoyed it very much. Recommended from me.
__label__1 Yesterday this was the faotd so I checked it out and almost didn't download it because everyone was bitching about in app purchasing but I play for hours before seeing any type of &quot;real money&quot; upgrade offers. This is a game where you make potte
__label__0 by the time u are done you spend like 30 bucks. you can buy the new Zelda on Wii for that.

__label__1 This FAotD is great.  It works for all the rooted tablets I have.  My kids are playing with it and love it.  They love creating the pottery and auctioning it for cash and purchasing stuff at the store.  What a great time filler.With all the negative revi
__label__0 Google sells this at the same price, but the cheap bastiches here have a twisted idea of IAP really is (though often abused).When one is cheap they see IAP as rip off - when you're a spoiled rich kid you can have all the cool stuff without playing the ga
__label__1 ITS A AWESOME AND FUN GAME TO PLAY ,, GOOD HAND AND EYE CORDINATION WHEN YOU ARE BUILDING ONES SENT TO YOUYOU COULD MAKE THE POINTS NEEDED A LIL LESS SO YOU CAN BUILD MORE
__label__1 this app is awesome I call it an app because it really isn't a game its quite pricey but I cant say it was for nothing
__label__0 I hate to be one of those jerks that rates an app one star but including in app purchases in an app that already costs 5 dollars normaly is ridiculous.
__label__1 Even though it is expensive... its alot of fun and right now it is the free app of the day. I always played it on my friends ipad but never wanted to spend the $. But now its free which is awesome! Its alot of fun.
__label__0 My wife and I love the movie Ghost with Patrick Swayze and Demi Moore so we were really excited when we saw this app offered today. However, two people using this app to make pottery is nearly impossile. We dropped my phone several times, called my paren
__label__0 In app purchases in a paid game (which costs rather high), and some items not available in any other means - that is very low... one star.
__label__0 Being the creative girl that I am, I was very excited to see what appeared to be craft instructions offered as a FAOTD! Then I started reading the reviews and it didn't take long to see that this app/game would likely be a total rip off. It also appears 
__label__0 This app has extremely pretty visuals and is a fun creative way to kill some time. It IS possible to unlock (nearly) everything through play, the IAPs exist to speed up that unlocking, but still... The presence of IAPs in any FAoTD sours the &quot;deal&q
__label__0 I gave it one star cause I liked the pic(not that much)anyway it sucks it wouldn't even let me open the game at all its terrible save ur money!!!!!!!!
__label__1 You make pottery and sell it. Then you buy some new designs and maybe a lid and sell another pot. Me and my brother had a contest to see who's pot would get more money. It was a fun app, but I wouldn't play 5 bucks.
__label__0 It's clear from just the cost, plus the IAP that this is strictly designed to part you from your cash.It seems that more and more of the apps are being thrown together just to use IAP. But reading through the reviews and how the dev switched the game aft
__label__1 I liked it but. The people that thought it was bad aren't very smart, it says lets crest pottery ofcores its an activety.
__label__1 well I read the comments and they were all bad but this game is fun if your good so try harder and it will be better for you
__label__1 I got it on free day it is ssssssssssssssooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo FUN. making diffrent stuff on my kindle fire. ;-))))))))))))))))))))))))) plus. ByE
__label__0 In app purchases in an already paid game are inexcusable for any reason. I do not care what reason you can come up with it is not valid.
__label__1 people need to play it before rating it. Imo this is beauty of a app clean crisp quite peaceful. my first few pots I made sold for between 6 &amp; 9 game dollars each. I worked up a total of 50 game dollars then I went shopping in the store. my first pur
__label__1 it is a very fun game when you do not have any thing else to do. not a rip off when on sale.
__label__0 I was really addicted to this game for a couple weeks then I decided to buy (with real money) extra brushes. I payed .99 cents for new brushes, expecting to have them In my inventory, but I still had to buy them with the pottery money I earned. Stupid. I
__label__0 here's a one star review to offset the blatant garbled engrish DOUBLE 5star reviews from the devs using similar names. And if you think IAP is poor form on an app that costs $5, you'd be right.
__label__1 Yes, highly addictive.  Don't miss out on doing the projects given by email messages within the inbox of the program.  Now I want to get a pottery wheel and try some of my creations for real!!! :)  Oh, and my 9 year old son is just as hooked.
__label__1 To start off, the app let's create your own pottery and that's one of the things that I like about these type of apps.  Also, it gives orders you have to fill out for other people and make the pottery they want.  It is such a cool app.  I would recommend
__label__0 FAOTD IS GREAT BUT I AM TIRED OF YOUR GREEDINESS WITH SO MANY OF THE CHOSEN HAVING IAP. NO MORE!!!!
__label__1 this app is so much fun! I got it for the free app of the day. but I so have to shut my kindle down once or twice but besides that you should get this game!!
__label__0 people must be losing their minds. i dont even need to download this app to give it no stars. or to never download an app from this company. terrible.
__label__0 Rarely does one find a company so greedy. I mean capitalism is on thing. But.. Charging five bucks for an app.. THEN scrooging you for additional dollars to upgrade to more scenarios and game elements. Shame.. Shame on you. Make the upgrades a part of th
__label__0 I would never buy an app for five bucks. I got it as free app of the day. Not even fun.
__label__0 I purchased this game for the original Kindle Fire that I had and I LOVED it!  So, when I purchased the newest Kindle Fire HDX, I wanted SO bad to get this installed on it and start playing.  Then I found out that it's not compatible with it.  :(PLEASE m
__label__0 I understand that the dev makes no money from faotd. however, it is NOT OK to let you people buy the game then wipe their data with a new update.
__label__1 I love playing this game. Even the freestyle allows me to be creative. I've finished all of the &quot;missions&quot; so to speak, and I'm hoping for more challenges in a future update.
__label__1 It lets you be as creative as you can be.. I love it app..so much fun. It makes me want to learn pottery:)
__label__0 Ok, let's get one thing straight, only God can create, not some little troll on there evil robot phone. This app will make you burn in eternal hellfire! WITH THE DEVIL! Don't ever assume you have God's Almighty power... That's my job, because I am a prea

__label__1 This app is fast-loading and concise.  You can verify the acceptability of a word in seconds which is a definite plus if you enjoy word games as much as I.  No holding up the game and a definition is optional.  I love this app.  It is much quicker than a

__label__1 This is a great app for anyone looking for a good place to eat!  Why waste hard earned money on so-so food.  Now I get the best!!
__label__1 this is one of my all time favorite apps. Urbanspoon is addicting, even when I don't need to find a restaurant. I love browsing through ny favorite cities
__label__1 Great site to let you know about various restaurants. I like the way that it places the restaurants in a category, makes it easy to find one that serves a particular type of food.
__label__0 I found it too difficult to use, so I deleted it.  Others may find it much more useful than I did.
__label__0 did not like this app free or not. deleted it. expected a little more than a joke. oh well that what you get for FREEEEEEEEEEEE.
__label__1 Tavel alot or just looking for that next place to enjoy a meal.  This is the app to have.  Helps you figure out where to go for almost any kind of meal, in almost any city you find yourself.
__label__1 I have enjoyed this app. It has been a great resource for finding new restaurants.  I go to the places that score 80 percent or better.

__label__1 Love this app.  Has lots of options. Choose your price, lock it in. Choose what food you like, lock it in.  Shake your phone, and the roulette gives you your choices.
__label__1 This is the first app I try when looking for a place to eat out.  When traveling, you usually have to depend on local entertainment guides, which are usually "sponsored" articles anyway.  This is a nice independant source to pick out a unique and tasty p
__label__1 I did not know what this free ap was when I got it. It is basically a way to find good places to eat. I do not eat out a lot so it want too helpful to me but if you do it is indispensable.
__label__1 I like to scope out local restaurants before going. The customer reviews are interesting, and being able to look at the menu is great.
__label__1 Urbanspoon is the best app for finding nearby restaurants. Because the reviews are peer-based and current, the feedback is accurate and reliable. Every place has "haters", but virtually every place I've been with an 80% or above "like it" rating has been
__label__1 This is basically just a Yelp app for Restaurants. Some of the more fortunate places have their menus posted which makes it easy to choose, but not always.
__label__1 My daughter told me about this one. She loves it, but you do need to have internet access. WiFi or 3/4G service.
__label__1 The Urbanspoon app is here and, in my humble opinion, far better than Yelp.  The folks who post on Urbanspoon tend to know a little more about food, service and perceived value.This is a great app when you're out of your comfort zone and looking for  pla
__label__1 Come noon every work day, it's the same ol' question.  'Where should we go for lunch?' With this app you just have to answer 3 questions: 1. What city do you want to have lunch in?  2. Type of food  3. Price range. Lock them in and shake your phone/table
__label__1 I always go to Urbanspoon before selecting a restaurant .. it will be very useful to have the app on my Kindle
__label__1 I always have problems deciding on food. This app is like my new friend.
__label__1 I've used Urbanspoon on the web and the iPad app, and it's a very helpful app for finding just about any kind of restaurant and price range you want, certainly one of the best of its kind. I live in the Atlanta area, and Urbanspoon has a fairly complete 
__label__1 THIS APP SHOWS YOU SOME GREAT RESTAURANTS LOCATED IN YOUR LIVING AREA. THIS IS A VERY GOOD APP TO HAVE FOR YOUR USES.
__label__1 We use this app often. it is not only fun to use but is very accurate. It makes finding a nice place to eat easy.
__label__1 I love this item it gives you so many restaurants to choose from, from the pricing to the type of restaurant it is, I gave it 4 stars because of my location, it limits where it chooses, but it is not the app it is the location I live in, so to be fair I 
__label__1 This is pretty cool, I am able to find lots of places to eat locally along with some nice ratings. It just needs to be installed and used a lot more so there will be more ratings.
__label__1 This is one of the best apps I've downloaded.  So useful.  I don't normally recommend anything to anyone, whether it be movies, books, apps, games or whatever, but this one is awesome.  If you ever go out to restaurants, you need this app.  Trust me.  Yo
__label__1 have it on my iphone and glad there's one for Kindle. great resource and easy to use. recommend it no matter where you live or visit.
__label__1 This app is excellent when traveling to find great locations. You can choose your price range in accordance with amount that you anticipate spending on meals if you are on vacation or just on a budget.
__label__1 Excellent program, I even forget I have when it comes to eating out.  Selections are great and with users uploading the photos the food and reviews are super.
__label__1 Just downloaded and I like it. Found my local favorites right away. Also found some in my little WI hometown.
__label__1 Great site to find restaurants in an area you are not familiar with when you are traveling.We also find restaurants close to us that are new.
__label__1 Picked this app up for use while I am attending an out of state wedding in Charleston, SC. Getting access to the names and addresses of many of the best reviewed restaurants in the area is convenient. When in Rome do as the Romans do. Just do it now with
__label__1 This sight is great! You can locate great eats even if you don't know the area. You can narrow your choices by cost -favorite foods -fine dining to fast food. Compared local eats to the site recommendations and found to be very accurate. This gave me the
__label__1 My fiance and I are always looking for new restaurants to try. He had this app on his iPhone some time ago, but I am not always with him. Now that I have this for my Kindle, when I'm out with friends we are opened to a new world of food!
__label__1 it is fun to be a food critic and post up photos and reviews of your food as you are being served at the restaurant.  This app is great to find good local restaurants to eat at, very useful!
__label__1 Before I had printed off the restaurants in the area. Now it's all at our fingertips..Great online reference. This could be one of the most valuable apps on my Kindle Fire
__label__0 several of my reviews of been taken down for no reason whatsoever.  it lasted for a while but eventually disappear.  I suspected foul play and set up a test to find out.  I gave a friends business a bad review and 3 weeks later they got a phone call from
__label__0 Unlike the web version, the Yelp app requires you to first create an account which leads to all sorts of spam.
__label__1 Great way to get reviews on restaurants, hotels and different business.  I always go to this site now to check out a place.  Helps me decide if I am going to visit this business are not.  Highly recommend.
__label__1 Not going to make this too long but it is Yelp. Good app for those of us that write reviews or want to look up business in the area!
__label__1 This Yelp app is tremendously helpful, with a friendly interface, feature for mapping out places, and makes it easy to review and finding restaurants, shops, and other places and services.The interface is very simplistic, with the profile, bookmarks, tag
__label__1 Makes my life so much easier! Love this app.
__label__1 Yelp is basically a community that rates their experiences at places (Mostly restaurants) The app is incredibly useful for me, especially when I am somewhere that I am unfamiliar with.
__label__1 This is a great application.  It has helped me discover new places in a city I've lived in for the last 28 years!! That's saying something!
__label__1 I always use this app while I'm out. It's very easy to use, and we'll designed. My hat is off to the designers of this app.
__label__0 seems like too much trouble to use. Pushes a lot of ads I don't care about. Too steep a usefulness curve.
__label__0 The mobile website AND app are awful. Why? Because you're limited on everything you can do. You can create a review but are forced to go to the full website to approve the review.  Then if you accidentally write something outside of the terms they remove
__label__0 Why does the app say that reviews will be posted next time I connect to Yelp via a computer?  Why?
__label__1 Really helps me make decisions on places to eat.
__label__1 Easy way to find resturants, hotels and other places where ever you happen to be.  Try it for Free! You can't go wrong!
__label__1 The Yelp app is great. It works reliably, similar to their website. When I'm hungry, I never use google maps - I use Yelp! It's far superior for finding food.
__label__1 I have been using yelp.com since the beginning. I was so happy when they finally made an app for the phone.You will find reviews from people like you and me. The app will find place based on your location.
__label__1 Remove app from Digital Device
__label__1 This is a fun app to test your knowledge of great art and to help your children learn about them as well. Fun and easy to use, there are short biographies of the artists and lists of their paintings which you can tap on to view. I appreciate that the pai
__label__0 To put it simply, it is just a collection of paitings with links to the web. It is worth a penny, no more.
__label__1 That is what this app gives me every day. I adore art and have many, many art and museum books. How about another with more and more paintings. When I was unable to get to the museums this winter because of the weather, I enjoyed this so much.Joan Noble 
__label__1 I love art and I love this. I really like where I can enlarge a painting to check out details and learn about the artists. This is great!
__label__1 IT'S WONDERFULL TO BE ABLE TO ENJOY GREAT WORKS OF ART WHEN YOU ARE UNABLE TO SEE THE ART IN PERSON.  THANK YOU.
__label__1 To see world famous paintings at home on my Kindle thrills me. To test my knowledge of art and artists makes me feelsmart. The beauty of this little site is stunning. It cannot cover all my favorites, but there are enough paintings thereto fill me and my
__label__1 It's an awesome app to have when someone like me, LOVES artwork!  I really enjoy looking at the detailed pictures.
__label__1 my five year old does not need a loto f information rightn ow so this is great, basic info and pictures
__label__1 As an educational tool, it is quite interesting.  There were many facts I had not thought about or heard before.
__label__1 This is a favorite.  Easy to attain information.  I  am using it to memorize the presidents.  Never know when you could be on Jeopardy
__label__1 I downloaded this to help my 3rd grader learn and to make him more confident in school. he loves it !!! Thanks Amazon !!!
__label__1 This is a really interesting program to have.  I really enjoyed it and it was fun for me and the kids to use.
__label__1 Think you know everything about our 46 presidents??  Try this game!  You'll find out how much you never knew--good fun!
__label__0 This app is good, though the typeface is tiny, though it has all the presidents, it's not thorough for anyone who likes American History
__label__0 nice game but has some kind of bug that would make the kindle to shut down
__label__1 My kids love this app, they have fun playing it. My students and personal children are learning while playing which makes them want to play more since to them it is just a game
__label__1 This is great play three games at once and pays back keeps your attention and never the same always changing
__label__1 If only the money was real...but, since you're not spending any money betting you should have a game that pays out a lot...and this one does.  Even my kids love to play it and hit the jackpot
__label__0 All slots games are redundant. This game is simply a bore. It does not allow you to bet over 15 coins even though you may have a &quot;cash&quot; balance of over a million dollars. I found that to be quite ridiculous. Also, graphics are sub-par in compar
__label__1 This game is awesome. I have never had a game that I could play like at the casino and win so much. This is worth having I love the game.
__label__1 This is a Cool Slot machine game,  It's even more fun with Virtual money. Great way to pass time. And you even get 3 Slot machines to play..  And it's. free..  Thanks
__label__1 We have a lot of fun with this slot game.  It's most like the real slots we play and doesn't cost us any money to play.  I have over $100000 on my game, my husband only has $700 and loses it all everytime.  No two games are the same!
__label__0 All this app does is try and get your money. The first thing they ask for is cash or credit.  Stay away.
__label__1 Great app, very fun. Love that i have 3 slot machines. My favorite app yet. Highly recommended. Thank you for making it a free app!
__label__0 I have played this game since I got my kindle over two years ago everyday. I had millions of dollars in my bank and then it just disappeared? What happened? I reloaded but have no money! Not a happy customer right now!
__label__1 if you get the bonus go to the wheel and spin on the blue 50 it gave me 1000 then 600

__label__0 your mom is the worst hahaha but the game has terrible graphics and the is no point if you can hardly see any thing at all
__label__1 Play this all the time, it a great little game and can keep you entertained for hours. I would recommend it to anyone who likes casino games.
__label__1 It is exciting to see what the next spin will give me.  It is fun for me to  see what the next spin brings me.

__label__1 I have had this game for awhile awesome game its fun and free I have not had to use any real money. I totally recommend.

__label__1 This is one of my favorite slot apps, I've played it extensively &amp; I absolutely love it and spend a lot of time playing it.  I've already bought 7 of everything from the slots store &amp; still have over $800 million, so I've obviously been playing f
__label__1 It's fun to play the slots and not lose any money.  It's good practice for playing the real slot machines.
__label__1 No money involved slots....what could be better.  All of us like to play the slots games so this one was a real hit on the Kindle Fire.  Is really responsive.  Would recommend this for anyone that can understand the game, no matter what the age.
__label__1 Altough this is not Vegas, it gives the same feeling of winning.  Graphics are not at all bad during game play.  Bet responsibly too.
__label__0 Slots Royale is a wasted program. Shortly after downloading it, I played it, and even shorter after that, I deleted it. It is a very cheezy game, and once downloaded, starts sending you constant spam from their contributers. I deleted the program and had
__label__1 Just like playing in the casino..but saving alot of money this way. Looking for more games like this for my kindle. Nice and relaxing pkaying this one.thanks for offering it..
__label__0 Worked fine before recent update.  Now the graphics do not work.  Background of the machines is all black.  Ads sure work though.
__label__0 this is not an excellent choice it is the worst app ever!!!!! you have to pay money to play this suckish app!!!!!! listen to this review unless you want to pay money!!!!!!thank you for your time for reading this review
__label__1 I absolutely love this app. I go to it at least twice a day when sitting to take a break from my housework or running errands. Totally worth the download and fun!-Joanne B. Blackwood NJ
__label__1 This is a great slots app. I have never once had a single problem with it, at all. No force closes, not one problem. I dont use it every single day but a few times a week. I like it and deffinatly recomend it to anyone!
__label__1 Super fun, I like having 3 different slots to play. Peaceful music. Would be nice if the slot had auto spin. Good graphics and I love the bonus wheel spin.
__label__1 Time flies when you are having fun! Best free slot game I have played on Kindle Fire. Not sure why the one star ratings say it costs money to play. It's only virtual money, not real cash.
__label__0 I really found no point in this app, it was stupid. Good thing it was free, and now off my kindle!
__label__0 I was anticipating a more active game, but it didn't capture my attention or imagination.. it may be fine for some but not for me. Will pass tme time away.
__label__1 This game is totally FREE in every respect.  Excellent graphics and a realistic feel make this the best slot game out there. This game is as addicting as the real thing with one major difference. If you lose your "money" you are still a winner.
__label__1 Slots Royale is a great FREE app from Amazon. It has more than one Slot machine and the Blackjack and Wheel of Wealth are fun to play when you get to a new level.
__label__0 This game was way to confusing for me guess I was looking for the old fashion slots that we use to play way back when, I do not like the new ones at all.
__label__1 I just like the fun of playing slots, if I'm bored, and this one is the best one I've found for my Kindle Fire HD.Fun game.  Multiple machine themes to choose.  Two bonus games you get to pick.  The corny music is just right.  Great graphics and sounds, 
__label__1 this is an addicting time waster/relaxer...play it when I have down time or between breaks from work...gives you that high roller feeling...
__label__1 nice to play when i have the time.no problems downloading.  like the different slot areas to choose to play in.  I would recommend it.
__label__1 Love playing this. It fun to actually have the same effect of real slots. I wish I could really cash out though

__label__1 For those who love the Slot machines, this ap is a must.  Colorful and many different variety of games; with a bonus spin.  My daughter loves it!
__label__1 This is a great casino slot game.  Quality graphics and realistic sounds.  Can be played with music in background.  Offers items to pretend buy with your winnings.  Can also Facebook it with friends.  Free too.  Get it and you'll feel like you're in Vega
__label__1 Slots Royale - slot  machines are very realistic and play as well and are as much fun as being in the casino.  The pay outs are small.
__label__1 Love to play this game.  It is easy and fun and you don't have to spend any money to play.  Great way to pass the time.
__label__1 I love gambling with pretend money!!  It keeps me on a roller coaster should I bet max or be stingy and only play one coin, oh what the heck what am I really going to lose?
__label__1 I am going to vegas next week and I can not wait the phone the slots are talking to me.
__label__1 I am not using this app any longer as I had it on my mobile and it ran down my battery very quickly due to I suspect all the graphics, etc.
__label__0 i dont play this game you have to use cash to play it i would like it removed from my kindle  but i dont know how
__label__1 I don't gamble for real so I am really enjoying this game. So far I have won $10,000. It passes the time when TV is borring. It is fun.
__label__1 Great game with 3 slot machines that can be played at the same time. What  makes this game so much fun is being able to use vertual money.
__label__1 This game is fun and addicting, and you can buy all kinds of stuff in the shop. I would recommend getting this free app.
__label__1 This is a great game and a lot of fun....would highly recommend . I like that you can play 3 game at once. Neat!
__label__1 I also have this app on my cell I love it I recommend it to everyone thank you for making such a great game
__label__1 Not only is it a very great and engaging slot; with your cash earnings, you can buy virtual luxuries and compete with others to get on the leader board. That is such an incentive to go on and on. I never had to BUY coins to play.
__label__1 D/L sgame, and it has been a lot of fun.  Not having to spend my own money to play game.  Thanks
__label__1 Free entertainment:  how can you go wrong?  I enjoy playing it late at night while watching TV.  Relaxes me and is fun.

__label__1 added live slot tournaments it has made it more fun and the best slot game going.  Give it a try.
__label__1 Works great on Kindle Fire.  Realistic sounds and graphics and has the choice of a few different machines.  The authors took a lot of care to make this an exceptional game.  I've had a few other slot games that just were wastes of time.  This is a good o
__label__1 If you like casinos you will love this applicationMultiple games in one appI would recommend to all for a fun game

__label__1 For me this is an entertaining game to play and watch TV at the same time.I like the features of the game.
__label__1 If you enjoy gaming, then this app will allow you to practice your technique (-;}  It doesn't cost you a dime and you likely win on a regular basis
__label__0 if im going to gamble with real money,i live in vegasthis should Not be allowed,this is gambling,i believe this is illegal, i will find out these games are for fun not real,its gambling if you Have to play with coins you have to buy with Cash
__label__1 After a recent trip to a casino in Louisiana, I came home with the 'fever', this was the perfect cure and it doesn't cost me a dime! Love it.
__label__0 Does not regenerate fast enough. Want to have you pay for more coins. No way to get more coins without purchasing. Thus, why in the world would I keep this app? I deleted it from my Kindle Fire HD.
__label__1 A very fun entertaining game. Very relaxing but watch out as you can get lost in time with the sounds and button pushing. Reminds me of a casino adventure only the pay outs are much better lol. Have fun with it like it is designed and ride the winning wa

__label__1 I love this app! Its so fun! You even get three different machines to spin on!! The graphics look great on kindle fire ;D
__label__1 Slots RoyaleThis game is addictive!  Sounds like the real thing and very entertaining! Easy to play for hours and not even realize it!

__label__1 You will never go broke playing this game,your jackpots pay on a regular. Music reminds me of the Rat Pack days.
__label__1 It works fine.  Nice graphics.  Good time waster.  Doesn't cost any money to play.  It's virtual, just like those warfare games you play.  You don't die, the virtual you dies.  When a video game starts requesting your ATM number,  be afraid.  Be very afr
__label__1 I enjoy this app because it is simple to use and provides hours of free play. The payoffs do seam to be on the unrealistic side compared to the Casinos.
__label__0 Test device : Samsung Epic, Android 2.2It looks like it could be a pretty cool app to play with, but, it crashes every time I try to look at the templates. :(
__label__1 I love this app! There are a lot of different things you can do with your pictures. I like how they keep adding new things. Now there are more than 300 effects you can choose from! There are even ones that move. For example you get to put your face on a 
__label__1 This app seemingly has a million frames and different ways to display and spruce up your digital photos. I've used it for six months and the developer just keeps adding more cool templates. Highly recommended. Using an LG Optimus C.
__label__1 I love this app and never would have imagine all the things you can dowith this app. It is by far my favorite and I can't stop talking about it tomy friends and family. The pictures you create look so authentic,no onewould believe it's just an app.Get it

__label__1 I am a graphic designer so I get a kick out of this app.  It does a GREAT editing job!
__label__1 I am having lot's of fun with this. This product has a lotof of photo making options to enjoy.
__label__1 My friend uses this app and turned me on to it. She has made some classics with it!! Great app.
__label__1 My friend got this app, and I wanted it too, and I thought it'd cost money, but WOW, no, it was completely free! It is funny and is the best photo editor in the world!! You need to get this app!! Don't waste your time on paying for other editors, when yo
__label__0 I must have downloaded it but it surely isn't a bit of help to me so it is simply on my kindle and I can't get rid of it totally.
__label__1 Turn ordinary photos into works of art or into fun/funny photos in a snap.  There are tons of different effects to chose from, this is a must have apP!
__label__1 at first I did not know how to play any songs but now I know how to playlots of songs I lobe this app.it teaches drums guitar and bass.I think its good for you music people out there.get this.
__label__0 first off i am happy my favorites on my iphone transfered over. but i cant figure out how to add something to my favorites on the kindle version. what REALLY ticks me off is that there is no tab pro on this app. sorry but i was expecting more. one star a
__label__0 this is seriously pretty terrible, i was expecting pro and all, but i find the database limited to the stuff on the ug site, and guitar tapp is a little cheaper plus it plays songs a little, so u can hear itthis app would've been way better had it be che
__label__0 A watered down version from the Android version for the same price. Wish I could have returned this less useful version of what is SUPPOSED to be a great app.
__label__1 This app is a well made app.  Its easy to use and read, it has a large selection, and it has interactive tabs.  It finds the song online, but then you can put it in your favorotes and go offline.  It is a really fun app.
__label__1 Cleanly done and well charted tabs and chords to many classics and current day songs. Was able to find things I'd been looking for easily with the search screen. You have your choice of how to play one song many different ways. A good app for beginners a
__label__1 Many songs to choose from, it has a self-scrolling bar so that was extrememly helpful. Really happy for the price :D
__label__1 This app lets you search the whole ultimate guitar database easily while on the go. It even lets you login, and save the tabs to your device for offline use, it saves you a lot of paper. Worth every penny, I am glad I bought it :)
__label__1 I play piano, but I have always used ultimateguitar.com. Now I can use it on my tablet too! I got it using free Amazon coins that I got, but it would well be worth 3 bucks. Favorites work offline too!
__label__1 I love this app-3rd time I've purchased this on a different device.  Love that it allows you to save your favorite tabs.
__label__1 If you want to know the truth about this app then look no further than this review the price is a little steep but it is very worth it. This app is very easy to understand with very little to think about except which song to play.PLEASE DO YOURSELF A FAV
__label__1 Ultimate Guitar Tabs takes all the tabs, search engine, and database of the website and adds some cool twists, like auto scroll, and the ability to zone in. You can also view chords and change the key right from the tab itself.It's clean and functional. 
__label__1 If you're curious about this, it's pretty likely you've been to ultimate guitar. Huge collection of tabs, a lot of features, etc. The site works great, and now, so does the mobile version. Honestly, so impressed with this app, it just plain works. The se
__label__1 If your a musician trying to increase your skill this is a great way to do it.  I use it mostly for the word and the scrolling feature is awesome.
__label__1 This app allows you to search for all kinds of songs and display tabs or chords if available for the songs. With the large screen of the Kindle Fire you can play the song right from the Kindle. There are also bass tabs. A great program for guitar players
__label__0 why spend 2.99 if you could just look it up on google or whatever? you get a few extra things with it, but no reason to buy this app
__label__0 Not a FULL Study Bible and somewhat confusing to me. Not worth the $9.99 cost. Have to pay more for some additions.
__label__1 Great to be able to access all the book of the Bible with  a touch of your finger. It's so easy!
__label__0 It not super apps for my kindle fire because it slow me down and it took too much memory so
__label__1 What can I say, this app is perfect for Bible reading/study when you don't have the written Word in written format.  And, you don't have to be connected via wi-fi to use it.  I use it on the Kindle Fire HD without a single problem.
__label__1 By far, this is my favorite Bible app in the Amazon Marketplace. This app is formatted perfectly for the Kindle Fire. It works well for serious sermon prep, as well as casual reading.  However, my favorite thing to do is to use the split pane view with a
__label__1 It is easy to read.  I like the transaction.  You can understand and apply it to your every day life.  It has been a blessing to me.
__label__1 I use this at home and at church.  Very easy to maneuver from book to book and I'm always able to keep up with the preacher when he says &#34;turn to the book of such and such&#34;
__label__1 Love this app. Easy to navigate. I can read it offline. A great resource. Worked well downloading. Other resources available through this app. NKJV not yet available.
__label__1 Love this user-friendly NIV Bible app on my Kindle Fire HD!The search feature is phenomenal - it quickly finds a verse, word or phrase.  For example it found the word "Lord" 6684 times in the Bible.  The search results can be refined to the OT, NT, Epist
__label__1 I'm really having fun with this game. One of the few games I spent a long time playing. Great graphics and tons of modes to choose from.  Love the anime aspects of it as well.  Fun story that goes along with the season mode.  Don't believe the haters. Th
__label__1 This game will keep you occupied for a while. The graphics are bright and colorful. It can be fun getting all the power ups and blasting the ball out of the park. It also has several different modes that  that extend the playing time.
__label__1 This game is slightly over priced, but that doesn't mean that it isn't enjoyable. The league mode and season options are a ton of fun. Good times.
__label__0 really not much to say but dumb, boring.  don't care for a storey line, lets just play ball and game play is not that great
__label__1 Superstar Baseball has always been known for its addictive gameplay. To me 2010 was much of an upgrade 2009 just different.  2011 on the other hand feels great improvement overall. The UI is slicker, artwork is better, game runs perfectly smooth not to f
__label__1 I paid for the 2010 version, &amp; was very pleased with it. This one is even better, with better graphics and sound. Today for free; can beat that!!
__label__0 Only tried this because it was free app of the day.  If I had actually paid for this I'd be really pissed off.  graphics and audio are super cheesy....like something out of the days of NES.  I'm not even sure you can call this a game.  It took longer to

__label__0 I didn't like this game it was very confusing I don't recommend you this app don't download It's also to expensive
__label__1 Very good game. Let the fielding be automatic or slow down the game. lots of options just take time to figure the game out. Lost first  game 16-1....now 11-4 in season mode.
__label__1 i checked this out mostly because of all the &quot;bad&quot; reviews, just to see if it was really that bad. first off someone mentions how its $.99 on marketplace, yeah it looks like gamevil is doing some kind of deal right now but thats not the normal

__label__1 My kids fight for the chance to play this game.  It's simple fun playing America's favorite pastime.  Used on DroidX, RAZR, and Xoom.
__label__0 I downloaded this app of the day and it has never launched. Re-installed and still same problem. It wont launch. Despite all the bad reviews, wish had a chance to ck it out. Uninstalled it anyway.
__label__1 One of the best apps on the Appstore and worth every penny even not at the 99 cent sale price. I had owned the previous 2009 edition on an iDevice and never got around to upgrading to 2010. Saw it on sale here on Amazon and had to give it another go.I am
__label__1 I wrote a previous review for Baseball Stars 2010 and it still stands. 2011 improves on graphics and tweaking animation of hitting and homeruns. This game expands on the overall game mechanics. Infield players are actually highlighted when they have the 
__label__1 There's a lot of fun to be had here. Basically the real draw is the career mode which is where you build a player up RPG style. Really great game.
__label__1 i plan to check out more games by this dev. it's a cute lil time killer. graphics are pretty decent. i played a couple quick games. it reminds of a few of my sons RPG's that he has for his GBA.if you want longer games play the more intense ones included.
__label__1 Not your run of the mill baseball game.  Be ready for some quirkiness and lots of options.  This is a very fun game!
__label__1 Love the games after my favorite TV shows.  It is so cool to feel like Im part of the investigation.
__label__1 Very interactive game; I only wish you could here what they say, instead of just reading it. Great game; keeps your interest throughout.
__label__1 I really enjoy watching NCIS on TV, so playing the game was fun!!  And I still enjoy playing it occasionally!
__label__1 I love NCIS I am the biggest fan i have them all over my room if you were a fan I would recommend it don't take advice from the 2 stars or 3 stars they don't know what they are missing.  I love gibbs my wish in the world would to meet him he is my Insper
__label__1 Great app for keeping track of your finances.  Intuit has great financial programs for the computer and now an equally great app.
__label__1 It really helps me keep track of my spending and where I can trim down and tighten up. I've used it on my laptop for sometime more, having it on my Fire makes my financial info much more accessible. I love that it has a passcode feature too.I would like 
__label__0 This is one of the must intrusive apps I have ever downloaded. I wanted guidance, not micro-management. Look elsewhere. This is like hiring a financial advisor that lectures you for buying brand name toilet tissue. No thank you.
__label__0 Would not work with my Bank or Payroll company. needs to be updated or have a disclamer of what banks it works with.
__label__1 I was using this website before I got my Kindle fire and I loved it. However I hated that if I used it on my small phone screen it just sort of became overwhelming and I didn't use it much at home. I LOVE using it on my Kindle, the screen is the perfect 
__label__1 Great app and easy to install and use. You can use your main computer and the mobilr device can be synched up with it. I'm still learning how to utilize all of it's features so I hope to get it up to max soon.
__label__1 very easy to use and simple to setup.  Once you have it sorted you can just port it to all your devices and have an on the go look at your financial picture.  Very useful
__label__1 I don't check my bank account or my credit card balances separately anymore.  I look here.  My only complaint would be that they still haven't done a deal with GE Finance or whoever has my Old Navy Card.  I can't take a star off for that so I'm just goin
__label__1 Smart design with great functionality.  Great display options for information assimilation. I have noticed, however, that there is sometimes a large pause in alerts between the time of the event and the time of the alert.
__label__1 Using this almost weekly, love it , love the updates and emails and the views that give you a good look at your money.
__label__1 I've used this app for about 2 years now. I love it. It allows me to check all of my accounts quickly and easily. Now and again there will be a mistake, but its easily confirmed by jumping through hoops on my main bank's page. And mistakes are usually ju
__label__0 I had come to depend on this program exclusively until the last update. It became unuseable on my Droid X2. I tried to address this with Intuit and was told it was a phone thing. Motorola said it was a MINT thing. I was in the middle. I then returned to

__label__1 I've had Mint on my PC for several years and find it very useful, so when I heard there was a mobile app for my android device, I added it to my tablet. I have to say, it's a really great tool that helps me keep up with expenses while I'm traveling or aw
__label__1 I would recommend this app to anyone, especially a college student who needs to save money. It is very easy to use, simply put in your information and the app does the rest. It will update itself automatically. You can also adjust what you would like to 
__label__1 Mint is from Inuit - you know the Quicken people and the TurboTax people. I've been doing my taxes on TurboTax.com for years so I had to give their budgeting app Mint.com a try. It can pretty much do anything. Tie it to your bank account and it can updat
__label__1 I'm still pretty new to this app but, so far, it's great.  Easy to use and I love seeing all of our accounts in one place even though they are at different banks.  Setting a budget is easy and it alerts you when you're near a low balance-no more overdraf

__label__1 I was already trying to budget before I got this app, and now the process has been made much more simple and straight forward. I use this on both my kindle fire and my computer. I absolutely love it!
__label__1 Very happy with the app. It makes logging in very simple and this was a great addition to the kindle.
__label__1 I love that I don't have to right down every detail or remember every receipt...the app pulls directly from all the linked accounts. Even more so it gives you a realistic goal manager that you can adjust based on your circumstances.
__label__1 A partner to my computer...it is great. I would recommend to any user. Easy to use and good information to have close.
__label__1 Provided you don't have a problem offering up all of your banking info to a third party, Mint can keep track of a lot of stuff for you.  I'm able to see every transaction on my credit cards, bank accounts, mortgage, loans and even my 401k account, making
__label__0 Added my bank account and doubled everything. tried to fix it and it wouldn't let me.  DO NOT INSTALL WASTE OF TIME.
__label__1 This app is simply just great. No problems whatsoever. The UI interface is nice & looks great on my Samsung Galaxy Tab. I highly recommend it for any mint user.
__label__0 Too personal.,..I do not like to give out this kind of information for no good reason except for an app. Who knows who will see it.
__label__1 Mint.com is a very useful website and this App (on a tablet) is excellent, it shows the budgets in useful graphs that make it easy to see where the money is going.  The app is also good on the phone but it lacks the graphics that the tablet version has a

__label__0 had to remove it because it confused me. The different numbers. i have no idea how they came up with those made-up amounts!
__label__1 I have been a fan of the website for 4 years now.  It is amazing the way you can get to know your personal spending using their tools and budgets.  Once it is set up, it is so simple!  I wish the app had all the same functions as the site, but it does se
__label__0 Have not used it yet so don't know first glimpse at it tells me no I do not want to put so much personal information on it.
__label__1 I like that I can look at my budget and goals when I am away from the computer. It is helpful when I am debating a purchase.
__label__1 I have used Quicken online in the past and was disappointed when they discontinued the online version. I switched to MINT and it took a little getting used to but it is a good app and I love it now.
__label__0 Used to like this site but not any more. My bank offers something similar to mint so rather than give another website all of my passwords to all of my accounts, I just stick with what my bank has to offer. Cancelled my mint account. Sorry, mint!
__label__1 I have used a number of other sites and there was always something lacking. With this app there is an up to the minutedata listing of all accounts. Most of all I found the quick reply from my email inquiries when I needed it. Highly recommend for persona
__label__1 You will love this app once you get it all filled out with your information.  It is great to have everything in the same place all the time.  How easy is this.... Give it a try, you will love it.
__label__1 I've been using Mint for years,  both web based and aneroid devices.  Simple to use, accurate and helps me keep track of my money and bills with little effort needed on my part after the initial setup.  Definitely. recommend.
__label__0 just another site with your personel info to be taken but it does put everything together can get the same from ms programs that come with your computer
__label__1 What a great app. I can break down my finances over the past few months, set and control budgets, and categorize my transactions. This app is for those who are serious about getting in control of their finances. I can share my account across all of my de
__label__0 Rediculous app that does not work. Unfortunately this review requires a certain number of words and that's all I have to say about it! Horrible and just want it gone from my device!
__label__1 I've been using 'SplashMoney' on my old PalmPilot for years and learned to love it. Sure, I couldn't get it to connect and download my transactions and had to manually enter everything, but I got used to that.  Mint automatically downloads transactions f
__label__1 I love this app.  It isn't perfect, but it is a great way to help keep track of your budget on the go.  It would be nice if I could read how my investments were doing too, but as a simple budget and goal tracking app, I couldn't ask for more.
__label__0 Can't use it if your bank not listed or if your bank uses more secure security procedures. Not useful to me.
__label__1 this app is better than going straight to their web sitethe quick-launch with passcode protection makes it fast and simple too!
__label__1 This is a great way to keep a reminder with you of where you are and the goals you have set.  No more late fees you can get reminders of when bills come due!

__label__0 I did not need this so removed it from my Kindle.  What was I thinking?  I use my Kindle for fun, reading or games, and not for anything as serious as finance.
__label__1 Love Mint's app and the services it provides. While there are some negative reviews out there, let's get real - this is one awesome app that provides a heck of a lot of features and, oh yeah, it's completely free! The value of this app is worth much more
__label__1 This app is easy to use, and encourages better choices,because I have a very visual reminder. It's worth lookin into!
__label__0 bad app. does not update ..balances most likely to be incorrect. taking it off my device. would nit recommend to anyone. will try to get a more updated app
__label__1 i like Mint.com because i can check everything online and on my kindle and its always up to date and easy to understand
__label__1 I find that I'm referring to this very often and it keeps me up to date, at a glance, on my finances.
__label__1 I've used Mint for years. I have it on my iPhone as well as my Kindle. It's a "free" way of keeping up with all of my accounts, budgets, and spending habits. It's wonderful. It is really easy to use as well.
__label__1 Mint has changed the way that I look at finances.  The entire app is centered around your finances, everything from bank accounts to loans can be placed unto it and monitored.  The app is a great way to monitor your own finances while you're on the go, w
__label__0 If you use a small local bank or credit union you're screwed if you want to use this app.  It won't even let you get started!  Really sucked for those of that really need something like this app to help us in these hard financial times. I'm extreamly dis
__label__1 Most folks wander around blithely spending money without regard for the long-range ramifications. This program helps you gather all financial information in one place, set a plan for maintaining a balanced budget, and provides tools for developing a soun
__label__1 This app is a must if you want to easily keep up with all your finances and stay organized. I'm surprised that not everyone is already using it!
__label__0 this would be a fun game if the damn thing didn't shut down simply by breathing on it...  these joy bits people should be ashamed for releasing an app with such terrible quality control.  great idea--abhorent execution
__label__0 Its that it constantly force closes after you find your stride and really start to enjoy the game. Just as you think to yourself, &quot;This is fun and intuitive in a weird kind way. I could play this fo-&quot; and then FORCE CLOSE! Such a waste of an ot
__label__0 You can't even play this after a while. Every failed attempt at creating an element after you have about thirty makes the game force quit.  Don't even waste your time downloading. Nice game, but it becomes useless.
__label__1 I love this app. It is not really a app.It is about the way God made stuff.I think a lot of people lie about this app. If you want to learn about the way God made stuff you should get this app.
__label__1 Didn't freeze on me!  I love the damn game!!!  You Rock, God...  I mean Doodle God!  PLUS you might actually learn something!
__label__1 I loved this game online, so I bought it for my iPod and iPhone, and when I found out they had it for my Kindle Fire, I was thrilled! It's free on the Apple App Store, so I'm glad they have it for the free app of the day on Amazon.
__label__1 Truly a great game to waste time with. I find myself always. Playing this game! You should definitely buy this game. One of the classic mobile games.
__label__0 when I first downloaded this game it played fine. when I went back to play later I got the same as everyone else force close over and over. if it helps anyone to know I downloaded it on my kindle fire I am going to uninstall and reinstall and see if that
__label__0 I loved the graphics in thus game. I want to play it! but... it will only force close on me. I was excited, creating new elements, trying to speed through it. Then bam! Every time I try to create another element Doodle god forces closed. I guess the game
__label__1 They did a new update today! Fixed crashing bug!  I LOVE this game, but the crashing was a little excessive.  In light of being free app of the day, they sent in an update that fixed crashing, so it is a must have!
__label__1 great game but keeps forceclosing please fix so I can rate 5 (kindle fire). . . . . . . . . . . . .now that its fixed its great just finished it dissapointed that the extras aren't there. Especially since the game tells you to check out the extras then y
__label__1 this app is so awesome it is worth more than what it is ($1.00) this app rocks so much I kind of don't mow what to say,  so have a nice day (I guess?!?!)
__label__1 This game is so so addicting and my kids love it! I especially like the parental lock. I'm just typing this sentence for enough words
__label__1 Fun game with lot of combinations.  I have been addicted to triple town which has a somwhat similar idea of combing things to create new stuff. Makes for a lot of interesting discovery.
__label__1 I love this game it is so much fun you get to create lots of stuff I once created a worm. I thought that was cool.
__label__1 First I tried the free version and couldn't get enough, got this version and now I have a hard time putting it down. It really makes you think outside the box on some of the elements. And it even has a kid safe mode so my children can play as well.
__label__1 I really love this app, I could play this for hours on end. The graphics are amazing, and some of the combinations are surprising & hilarious. It's a must get!
__label__1 I wish this was the first Alchemy combo game I'd played since it has the best UI by far.  But since it was the third or so, I was a little frustrated since some of the combos are different.And the art is cute on this one also.
__label__0 You pretty much have to buy in app purchase just to complete  this game.  It's pay to play even though you bought it...Oh and its pretty borring unless you like random guessing.
__label__1 I didn't think I would like the game, since I've played alchemy before and not liked it. To my surprise, I started it and lost half an hour without even noticing. The graphics are fun, the quotes are pithy, and playing is easy and engaging. Unfortunately
__label__1 i love this game woo much and played it on an iphone . i immediately. wanted it but it wasn't on the kindle fire. may e next will be temple run...
__label__1 It is a good fun game, creative, something you don't see that often, and one of the games, that some of you people obsess about like alchemy, that started off a series of games i.e. alchemy. Good game, no real big bugs (occasionally glitches and lags) bu
__label__1 love this game and very glad they updated it so it doesn't force close anymore and that they did it quickly:) almost created everything

__label__1 was force closing. but the new update works. using moto xoom. only suggestion will be to disable combining doodles which have already been previously combined. thanks
__label__1 I am IN LOVE with this game. I have a kindle fire and I was really confused when it wouldn't let me play it and it kept saying &quot;Doodle God has stopped&quot;. But then I was riding the bus home (which means I had no WiFi) and it worked and when I got
__label__1 After  the upate i no longer get any force closes on my kindle fire. Great game, good job on the fast update.
__label__0 this game is kind of fun at first but it gets stuck every time it just freezes and I just have to wait for my kindle to run out of battery in my opinion save your money this game is not worth a cent
__label__1 I didn't think I would like this game, but my son got me addicted to it. Has lots of helpful clues.
__label__0 This game started out great. The graphics, sounds and music, were all entertaining and fitting. Very unique idea for a game. I would have given this game 5 stars but, it kept force closing on me.Please update soon for those of us who would like to comple

__label__1 well it is a very good game great for passing time. but, there is some content that isn't for small children I myself was quite surprised to see what happened when you pit human an  human together so beware!
__label__0 the game is very fun but the force close makes it un playable. If you want to play it go on the Internet insted.-
__label__1 This game is ssooooo sick!! The levels are a bit long but it is really fun. You just have to get it!! :) It isn't what I expected at all. The first level is about elements!! Go figure.
__label__1 I think the bug causing all the forced closures has been fixed. I downloaded the app later in the day and so far I've made 65 elements and have had no problems on my Kindle Fire.  Other reviewers have said they get a FC around 40 elements or less.  Hopef

__label__1 I got this game as FAOTD about a week ago. I just finished it today. I found it very entertaining when I played it online (so if you're not sure you want to get it, look it up to see if you'll like it; I'm certain you will), and was happy to see it avail
__label__1 I had the free version on my phone for the longest and loved it. When I saw all the problems people were having with this, I almost didn't get it. I am happy that I decided to get it anyway. I had no problems with force closes on my kindle fire.
__label__1 This game (after update) doesn't freeze! And I love the introduction!! The Doodle God I think is a dragon! The freezes aren't on the kindle fire, or at least mine. So I think that this is a decent free app comparing to the previous days......
__label__1 The Devs updated Doodle God and I can now play without crashing constantly!  I am looking forward to playing it for a long while to come, it is an entertaing, if frustrating game, since duplicating previous combinations is extremely easy to do and the tr
__label__1 This game is extremely awesomely FUN. You get to mix different elements to make new elements. Everybody should get this app. If you don't you're missing out on a great expirence. It is sort of like Alchemy too. So if you like Alchemy definitely get this

__label__0 Seriously? This game sucked anyway why make it for the Android market? Plus what does doodle have to do with God anyway? Whatever Android....
__label__1 I love this game a lot. I have to use my brain in order to beat this game. I love how i can make so many elements in the game.i also like that there is mini games added to doodle gods.
__label__1 very fun and challenging game! had no issues playing, I think the force close was fixed. game is long took me about a week and half to finish, there are also three bonus levels I haven't played yet. definately worth the price, I got it free but still wou
__label__1 this is the best app I have seen so far it is my favorite one to use on my amazing kindle fire thank you amazon!
__label__0 The problem is that the programming causes the app to force close constantly. This is a five-star application once it is fixed. My suggestion: download it today to get it free then wait for them to get their act together.
__label__1 Works perfectly on my kindle fire. Easy to play and it fun. I played for about 10 minutes after I got this app.  Love it!
__label__1 I love this game its so interesting yet it keeps force closing. please please fix it please! this is one of those games that are just too cool to not fix
__label__1 the game is so addicting!!! making hundreds of elements starting from four is a great concept. it only force closed on me once and it didn't bother me.
__label__0 Game was a joy for about the first 10 minutes.  Now absolutely every combination crashes the app (causing an unexpected stop).  You'd think that Amazon would check for things like this before releasing the app...
__label__0 I have a few problems with this app.* First, it did nothing for me personally. I just considered the game play to be mechanical, random, and boring.* Second, so will kids like it? It doesn't matter. Unless you want to school them on age inappropriate lan

__label__0 Like so many others before me this game force closes after around 10 minutes of game play. Was this supposed to be a free trial and not a free game?
__label__0 You can play for a little bit and I'm excited to see what the other &quot;episodes&quot; include, however when the force closes start, its impossible to play or enjoy. My guess is either Amazon or the developer won't update, but if they did this seems li
__label__0 I downloaded this game despite reading all the reviews, good and bad. After downloading, even before I opened the app, it made me crash out of every other app that i opened. MAJOR flaws need to be fixed. I always give the &amp;#34;FAOTD&amp;#34; a chance
__label__1 Lots of and quirky too. I enjoy playing when I am waiting. Try it out! You will enjoy it too!
__label__0 aa lways force closes after a few minutes o f playing making it almost impossible to play, needs. update soon
__label__0 I got this app this morning as the free app of the day.  It worked great for the first 15 minutes, but then has been force closing every time since when I try to open it.  All I got to do was match a few elements together to make new ones, which truthful
__label__1 Everything works now, 5 stars. Fairly quick response to public outcry from the publisher, nice to see in an age of "you paid us all ready, now it's your problem."
__label__1 I love this game cause you get to make new elements and the new elements are actually things that already exist on earth.This game rocks
__label__0 Looks really cool but can't really play it if it keeps crashing. Fix it and I may change this review.
__label__1 I love Doodle God! I love the child safety mode and the extra game modes.I just wish Doodle devil was free and so was Doodle God.(maybe a free day when the games are free!!! But please tell me) :) lol  luv this game.
__label__0 I just didn't like it.  I didn't get excited about accomplishing the goal. ( whatever the goal was) I removed it from my device, and I'm happy it was free. No money wasted
__label__1 dear creaters,I think you should have the age of science.with a new element atom.stuff like plutonuim and gold is uranuim eft. your game rocks!
__label__0 It's just an Alchemy clone with fancy graphics and more hassle-filled interface. My advice is just get Alchemy because it's free.
__label__1 I love this app. It's very intertaining, but, Force Clouded COMPLETELY ruins it. Fix that and this ONE app is my favorite app. Fix force clouded do I can shower in my godinessness.
__label__1 #NAME?
__label__0 I adore this game, and have played it on other devices, but the constant crashes on my Fire make it unplayable. Sorry Doodle God, you just don't work.
__label__1 Loved the trial versions. however it needs to be for FREE!!!!!!!! more people would probably get this game which would mean more customers. please make it for FREE!!!!!!!!!!!!
__label__1 Amazing game, and dedicated devs who put an update out on the same day it had the problem, really fun messing around with the combos.
__label__0 Can't play once you get to a certain level.....force closes with every combination.  You would think with all of the reviews and complaints discussing the same issue, they would try to fix it.
__label__1 love the game for my kindle. Can you put more episodes in it and more elements and groups please. h h h h j h
__label__1 this game is great!!!  i got my hubby and 4 yr old playing it also!!! i would recommend it....nice thing to play to pass time!

__label__1 Awesome sauce. I love this game because it allows you to make things . Like a human,a scientist,and a cow.
__label__1 this game absolutely kicks ass! I'm hooked after one day and I'm sure you will be too! combine elements and make new ones! you are a God and you create everything! 4 levels plus bonus challenges for variety. MUST GET!!!!!
__label__1 I was one of the first to play Doodle God on Pc and wanted to do it all again. I am only rating 5 stars so the developers will take a look at this and repair the force close. I got this game despite the force close and didn't have a problem with force cl

__label__0 First off am I the only one who finds the concept of pretending to be God highly offensive? If I am, I don't care, it's offensive, even if it's "just a game".I refuse to download this. Other users have said it force closes constantly, which is another re

__label__1 no problem with forced close ... cute animation ... funny quotes .... loved the game ... wish there was more to it ...
__label__0 This is a really fun game but sadly it keeps crashing. Its unplayable. I hope they fix it. Its about matching two things to help you advance. Like you pick water and earth and that will give you a new element to play with. As I mentioned. the game crashe
__label__1 Berfore the update I could ha e tracked the makers down and strangled them with my bare hands. Now its super fast, no FC's, and no delays. FINALLY!!!!
__label__1 I love this game and the fact the it doesnt need internet so i can play anywhere i want to at any time!!
__label__0 The concept is so pathetic. What God did do was speak and create from nothing - he did not combine resources as this app suggest. Genesis 1:1
__label__1 this game is wonderful. you create virtually endless things, and when you get to the end, you have already forgotten all the combos and can start again! two things are a little annoying, one is that a glitch can happen where all the text disappears, just
__label__1 I played it and it did close but after undated its fine really fun good for faotd I needed more words so I put this
__label__0 They say if you connect to Facebook you can save your progress so you can play on another, different device.  Spent hours trying to figure out how to get my progress from my old Kindle to the new one but gave up and lost everything.  Of course customer s
__label__1 This an updated review. Yesterday there were issues with force closing constantly. I'm very happy to say these issues were quickly addressed by the developer with an update. The game works brilliantly now on my Kindle Fire. This is a very unique and fun 
__label__0 at 35 elements and now it forcecloses every time I select the second element to combine. please fix to change rating. (on EVO 4G)
__label__1 so it's a good game but keeps having to force close on my kindle fire when they update it it will be the best game on my kindle.
__label__1 Its fun for a while i mean u can do all the combos and stuff, but after a while it gets kind of repetitive. Still fun every now and then though :)
__label__1 This game was very impressive.  The premise and game play was thought provoking, entertaining and quite addicting. I was glued to my Kindle anxious to find the next successful combinations until it was complete.  I extend my appreciation to the developer
__label__0 Crash, pull out battery. Try again, crash, pull out battery, Try again, crash,.......might be a nice game top give a try if it would work.
__label__1 This game has no flaws for me! Add more elements and groups. I'm up to 203 elements! I don't understand why people are saying it force closes. It doesn't for my Kindle Fire. Oh, well!
__label__0 Force Close at 36 items. That was a great use of 30 minutes. Could be fun if fixed. Also, allow option to turn off re-matches.
__label__0 Like the rest... Force close just about the time you start to enjoy... Download while it's free... Maybe they will fix it?
__label__0 I love this game so much!&iexcl;!!!!!!!!! best game ever!!!! I liked alchemy but this is a hole lot better!!!but it is kinds frustrating tho to find matches
__label__1 Nicely done take on the mid the elements concept. Works just fine on my Nexus S without any problems. It is a bit slow to load initially, but it's fine once it gets started.
__label__1 the best game ever. very fun and creative!!!!!!!!!!it looks lame at first ;but it is realy fun wen  u play it.
__label__1 This game was a lot of fun until I had 28 elements. Then randomly it started to force close every time I tried to do anything.  Hopefully this will be updated soon since it really is a fun game.Update: The problem has now been fixed and works great! Than
__label__1 I had no.problems whatsoever.  except putting it downplease send more updates.  enjoyed the other two. games as well. the mini games were great.
__label__0 this app is very bad before u do anything chage to child safe mode ithas u make cascade and when you mix a human and a human and it says sex
__label__0 its funny how the only recent entry NOT complaining about force closing is someone who knows just about EVERYTHING about the game... I don't like developers who comment and rate up their own apps. HELLO!!! We can see right thru you! why don't you FIX the
__label__1 this is a great game.you all should do THIS!Nothing is wrong with this game.idk why you guys think that.you all should play it. like they say we all have our op.I gave this game a 5.Like I said you all would play it same day.this is a great game.I like t
__label__0 Dont like anything about this app.  Dont the name.  Don't like the way it runs.  Don't like how slow it is.  We say this game sucks.  The thing is creepy.
__label__1 I &lt;3 this game so much!! When I got it, I was nonstop playing it!! It doesn't crash on my kindle fire and it works like a charm! definently recommend it!!
__label__1 I think the game is so amazing!!!! I play it all the time, and its even in my favorites area, that's how obsessed I am!!!!!!
__label__1 Lol didn't think it will be this fun. But it seems like I can't stop till I try as many combination.
__label__1 Meow Meow Meow em me mw ne en. its awesome and really fun it teaches you many things including the awesome mini games
__label__0 game is awesome but it forecloses so much.  it doesn't do that on the ipod fix it and get better reviews its that simple.
__label__0 great game till i got 90 items then any time i tried to make anything it would freeze and i couldn't do anything making a great game really sucky
__label__1 I LOVE this little game! Had a similar once a while back, but this has better graphics! Mix different combinations of elements together to see what it creates!
__label__1 I'm having a blast with this game. The only problem is it's so addictive, I'm having trouble getting other things done!
__label__1 this is the first of three so far and the longest as well. this game is well worth looking into!
__label__1 I love the game soooooo much but I cant get the full vertion waaaaaaaa oj yeah and my name is Hailey not amy amy is my mom :)!!!!!!
__label__1 This is a great game that I would recemend to all ages for younger ages turn on the safty feature in the options area
__label__0 What is the point of this &amp;#34;game&amp;#34;?  None so far as I can tell.  Don't waste your time or money.  You have to somehow match elements to create new elements for no apparent reason.  Oh, as others have stated this is NOT appropriate for young
__label__1 Doodle God is a great game and runs beautifully on my kindle fire. I took a risk buying it judging by other reviews but I was anticipating the 28th element and it worked! I kept going and I love it. I highly reccomend it and also Doodle devil (which is a
__label__1 I downloaded as FAOTD and initially had the crash problem, but once that was fixed, I made it through without any glitches. It was fun trying to figure out which combinations would create a new element. Some of the results were humorous- such as creating
__label__1 I love this game but unfortunately it crashes all the time. Hope they fix it soon and can't wait to keep playing! Lg optimus
__label__1 I was expecting a average app but I got a highly addictive fun app but some is not for young kids like under 9-10 I hope this is helpful before you spend the 2 dollars :) moll's out peace!!!!!!'!!
__label__1 This is a deceptively simple, yet clever game. It is hard to explain, but it mainly consists of trying to combine elements to create new things. It sounds silly and uninteresting but it is excellent. It requires some thought and becomes extremely engross
__label__0 i was really liking the game and trying to figure out level one. was going great and as soon as i made tools ot started force closing..... I am so glad i didn't pay for this or i would be pissed. if it worked it would be a cool game
__label__1 I love this game. It is an awesome alchemy game.NOTE: Why r people describing the game in their rating? Just put this instead
__label__1 I love doodle god! I started with the free version but ended up buying the full  game! luv it. i recommend it 2 any1!!!!!  ;D
__label__0 if u press force close u cant play it any more. but before it was great but now not.Ps hdjdjdnsnnsndndbx
__label__0 I love this game. I just cant play for long without it producing a force close. it gets old. very fast. can you fix it?
__label__1 this game rrrrrrroooooooocccccccckkkkkkkksssssssssss!!!!!!!!!!!!!! love it but make sure to put it on kid mode it you don't wont your kid seeing the word sex or vodka.
__label__0 if there was a way to give negative stars i would.not because out is a bad game but because the force close bug is bs.nothing like having over 100 matches then all of a sudden you're save is dead.this is stupid.
__label__1 So far I've been stuck playing this game for well over 30 mins. Still on the first episode though, I managed to create 28 of the 248 elements and I have 8 of 26 groups. Have not experienced any lag or force closures. Graphics are pleasing and gameplay is
__label__1 I love this game but it's a bit pricey for a game as it's variety of side games are a tad bland and in some aspects could be better
__label__1 I love the game. it deserves five stars for northing more  than what apple + cellphone =. point is, if you don't get an error and can think about the choices you find a genuinely funny and clever game here.
__label__1 i had the fc issues that others did . after update this afternoon its cleared up and the game is a lot of fun now.
__label__1 force close! !!!!!!!!fix the force close please! !!!!!!!fix it fix it fix itgreat game but it force closes!
__label__0 Despite the reviews I thought I'd give this game a try. Sadly the force closes happen so often it makes the game virtually unplayable.Even if the force closes weren't an issue I think I would have a hard time enjoying this because of one key feature.  My
__label__1 There are endless combinations of fun for this game, would highly recommend to anyone looking for a good puzzle game.
__label__0 I have an EVO 3D and I usually (errrr... never) have this problem with other games, but it just keeps force-closing to the point that I'm not interested in it anymore. I've read other reviews where they are having the same problem on the EVO 3D.
__label__1 I have seem many comments about it force closingI have gotten 180 different combinations and it has never forced closed! I love this game!
__label__1 A way to teach sequential logic to the masses. Combine basic elements to create life systems. I was disappointed whwhen I combiined a worm and alcohol and did not get tequila. No one is perfect. Great game. Requires in app purchase.
__label__1 Doodle god is a game where you combine the 4 existing elements (fire, water, earth, and air) to create new things. Some combinations are realistic - some not so much.  Some examples would be water + earth = swamp or fire + water = alcohol.  Everything yo
__label__1 I was wary of downloading this, even as the FAotD, due to the numerous reviews stating that it force closes on the Kindle Fire after a few minutes of gameplay.  I found this not to be the case -- the app runs just fine.This game kept me amused far longer
__label__1 this game is 99&cent; the value of it is 10$ love this game I keep on trying to get more and more theme's all I want more is up dates GET IT
__label__1 Last update fixed forced closures. Good thing too because this game is really great. Worth every penny now! I would recommend to anyone
__label__1 I don't know what these people are saying!!!! I freaking looove this game! I played it nonstop till I beat the whole thing
__label__1 I thout this game makes you think a lot. but its a good brain User. the game also isn't very fast to complete which is another reason why its so fun.
__label__1 I rarely offer five stars, but this app is a fresh idea.  The graphics are great and the  music is very well put together.  I had to pull myself away from the game to write this review.  I have read in some reviews about the game force closing on others,
__label__1 This game will have your attention from the start captivating ur attention and drawing u into its simplistic 1 finger gameplay for hours as u create hundreds of discoveries from 4 base elements
__label__1 I don't know why people are giving this game bad reviews.  Its such a fun game, and on the kindle, I haven't experienced any glitches.  Ive played this game before on the Internet, and I loved it, and now to have it on the kindle is just wonderful.  Grea
__label__1 This is a lot of fun now that they've updated and fixed the problem. It's a very big game I think, since I've been playing for hours and haven't even finished the first of four chapters.
__label__0 I downloaded this even with all the bad reviews cause I thought it couldn't be that bad. Well they were right. It was working fine then a force close popped up and now I can't play at all. Can open the game and click to play but then it closes. was reall
__label__1 I don't play a lot of alchemy games, but I decided to give this one a go. I'm really enjoying it. love the in-game quotes when a new element is made.game crashed at first,  but, Devs fixed that on the same day, awesome job on that (and the reason for my 
__label__1 no forced closes.  no lag.  super addicting. works perfect on my kindle fire.  I have come across an element or two not appropriate for children.
__label__1 Well on a Nexus 7 this is fine! No force closes or any problems to me. I don't know what people are talking about it being boring it is so fun and addicting . Please get this app! Well it's super fun to a 10 year old I should say.
__label__1 best game ever! very addictive and fun. my entire family loves it. so download it. although don't download the free version it ain't free
__label__0 it was fun but then it stopped working because of the force quit so I tried to uninstall it and then reinstall but now it wont even let me do that. ugh I wish it lasted longer.
__label__0 This app just will not keep running. After about 20 minutes of playing it force closes.  I am playing it on a Kindle Fire and the game was OK but the force close just kills the fun.  From the look of all the reviews, it needs a lot of work to fix and mak
__label__1 Thank you soooo much for fixing the bug. I absolutely love this game. I can't wait to get the other games this.
__label__1 best game I ever played!!!  , . . . .. . .. . . . . . . .
__label__1 Glitch is fixed, I've lost at least a day to this game.  I love it.  I even dreamed about it.  Best game on my kindle.
__label__0 Sorry this game was not at all stable on kindle fire.  It started out fun and I got to play for little while.  Then the game wouldn't stay open and kept getting the force close message.  Tried on and off over two days but it just doesn't stay on.  I trie
__label__1 For all you Low Information people out there, you can turn &amp;#34;parental control&amp;#34; on or off. I forget exactly what they label it as but you can turn it on for the little ones. Look for it in the options menu.And as for the game, I think it's 
__label__0 I liked the game on the computer, but this app sucks. Every time I play there is a glitch, and no one ever likes glitches. The game crashes often and I have already had to delete and re download the game. DO NOT BUY THIS APP. PLAY IT ON THE COMPUTER or s
__label__1 Just putting it at 5 so that the dev's 'might' continue updating as they indicate in the program. App works fine until you have a certain number of combinations figured out and then it force closes on every incorrect combination. I was able to tin thrum 
__label__1 lol great when your bored a real pass time if you like learning new things this is a great app to download worth the money
__label__1 This game user interface is alot better than alchemy, the user interface and graphics are alot better than some of the other alchemy games out there. Three interface is great, which makes it allot easier to play
__label__0 Sorry to complain about something that was FAOTD.. but I invent things.  And this app was really stupid.  You click two icon boxes, and the game either says &#34;yes&#34; or &#34;no.&#34;  You get a new item in your list to pair with, or you don't, that'
__label__1 cant believe it! it finally came for the kindle fire!!!very fun and makes you think about the things that create our world.
__label__1 I love it. it is so fun. no problems. easily better than Doodle devil or Doodle farm. get this app. everyone says there are problems with it it works just fine on kindle fire.
__label__1 I wasn't sure bout this game at first but once I started playing it I was hooked..... its a very fun game especially on a kindle fire...... :o)
__label__1 It is the most awesome game I have ever played and is the most entertaining game I have ev.er played
__label__0 Game keeps force closing after playing for awhile. Please fix. To get to the next part you have to finish level one.
__label__0 The app stopped moving  through the introduction pictures. I could still hear it talking. I was unable to leave until I did a soft reboot. When I was able to use the kindle again the app was not even listed. I thought that was odd. Glad I did not pay for
__label__0 lame
__label__1 this is a really great app for kids. its not that complicated to follow. my 3 year old brother can play this game.
__label__1 and I love it. the force close is fixed, I have made 49 elements with no problems so far...except that I'm stuck and cant find anymore matches! I'm going to be addicted to this game...
__label__0 Wow... This force closes A LOT! Same thing as alchemy, but a little better organization and cute graphics. Really irritated at all the forced closures... Had to take my battery out one time to get my phone to not be frozen. Please fix!
__label__1 I love this game, so it gets 5 stars. but honestly, there's next to zero animation in this game, it shouldn't tax the system in any way so why so much stuttering and force closing? I can only guess it's poor programming. could be the device (fire) but si
__label__1 Every now and then, some obscure game publisher or developer makes something original.Among the &#34;casual gamers,&#34; we've seen this in games like Plants vs. Zombies, and Bejeweled... Doodle God is up there for me. It's interesting, it's sometimes fu
__label__0 was working fine for a while.  now force closes.  evo 3d.  same game as alchemy.  was fun when it was working.
__label__0 so not worth 2.99 I tried downloading it on my kindle fire and after 2 weeks its not working my daughter is mad now it wad her favorite app
__label__1 well I love the game and Dodoodel devil but I have to agree it dose have a lot of flaws and it sometimes closes you out and you have to stop playing but other than that it is awesome
__label__0 I was really really enjoying this game earlier today, but now... it keeps force closing when I open the app and try to play... makes me sad! It was really fun while it lasted, hopefully they fix this....
__label__1 Okay, so this game has NEVER force closed on me ever, so it must be a problem with everyone else's Kindle Fires.  This game is the best game imaginable, hands down.  It's so addicting I play it all day long, and I can't stop playing it until my Kindle di
__label__1 This app was so much fun. I really enjoyed playing it. After the update it stopped force closing and I beat it. I enjoyed playing all the levels and quests. It was very enjoyable.
__label__1 Just downloaded and played on my Fire with no problems. Apparently the apps been updated and whatever the problem was earlier it's been addressed. I'm glad I took a second look at this app tonight. To bad it's not more clearly marked as fixed. Does not d
__label__1 this is one of the best games ever I would highly recommend this to every one. I hope you enjoy this as much as me.
__label__1 ss dd dd. dd edd ed d d d d Fcc d d d d d f f d d d d
__label__1 Glad I tried it.  Have it on the KF and it worked great for ten minutes.  Addictive but have to go to work!  If I have any probs will update but seems KF prob was fixed.
__label__0 I would give 5 stars if I could actually posy the game but sadly it force closes every time I open it now
__label__0 I had really hoped that the vast majority of reviews were wrong.  I tried and tried again thinking &quot;This time I'll get the hang of the game and it will be awesome!&quot;  No such luck.  It sucked from the time I started to the time I quit and uninst
__label__1 I think this game is awesome  but you may have  a different opinion but this is my review not yours . This is an awesome game  I recommend it to people who are tired  of sort games that end super fast this game may never end if they keep updating it I ho
__label__1 I got it as the FAOTD and it never has force closed on me. No lag, either. It's a fun game and a good way to pass the time!
__label__0 I loved this app it was amazing but everytime I played it forced closedawfulplease do not get it
__label__0 For me the game will not even download. I got to 72% then it froze. And every time I press install to try again it says &quot;bla bla bla bla, cannot complete bla bla bla bla please try again.&quot; Its so freaking annoying!
__label__1 i got this app on my kindle fire and it works perfectly fine. all those people that say that it forces close u guys are wrong.
__label__0 It would have been a five stared. but it kips fore closing me. so I have to give it one star. I really hope they fix it soon. DON'T WAST YOUR MONY ON IT UNTIL THEY FIX IT.
__label__1 I love Doodle God so much on the computer I saw it on here... sometimes it has glitches other than that very addicting!(:
__label__1 I really like it. I wouldn't get it for 3 dollars though so I'm really glad its free today. Its a thinking game so i recommend it for people who like puzzles.
__label__1 This is a great game unlike any I have played before. No speed or hand to eye coordination, just concentration.
__label__1 I loved this game. For. 99, I thought it was worth it. Too bad it had to end. It was challenging, but I like that (Most of the time I had to use hints.).
__label__1 I had always really loved this game before it came out on the mobile devices but now I think its even better.  it was really fun and time consuming. well at least after they fixed the force close bug
__label__1 this game is well...THE MOST AWSOME FLIPPING GAME EVER!  well besides minecreaft...obviously.  how far am I?  Allmost done!  ha ha!  this game is tarific!  buy it for unlimited fun!  really worth it.
__label__1 I have done the hole intier thang. I love it it is for me and it will for you too.Get This App!
__label__1 idk what the people are saying about force close because it hasn't happened to me at all and this game works great on the kindle fire... ;) very fun game but there was an element that surprised me.. humanxhuman=? lol
__label__1 My kids and I spend hours seeing who can get a new creation. We love it. Great fun for the whole family.
__label__1 I picked this one up just to look at play mechanics and a week later I was still playing it.  My wife then started stealing my phone so she could play it too.Great purchase, looking for future enhancements.
__label__0 This game is really great...for about the first two minutes of anytime you open it. Unfortunately, it freezes up WAY too often. Please fix for a better rating. Samsung Nexus
__label__1 fun game easy and fun to burn up a few hours on a flight or buss ride word word word
__label__1 I've always loved this game! Was so happy when it came out for free on Amazon apps. Didn't know it had the bonus games after each episode...they are fantastic! Thanks for a great game, and great experience.
__label__1 The graphics in this game are so adorable that I can't help but love it. It is kind of exasperating trying to find the right combinations, but that is what makes the game challenging.
__label__1 I thought it was great. Totally worth $2.99 but hey, I got it for free! Those of you who have Kindle Fires,it works awesome. Good graphics too!
__label__1 Its so fun! Its entertaining. This is something to get! Its not frusterating. Its easy! Sorry for so many its lol.
__label__0 All you do is constantly combine the same elements over and over again in hopes of making something new. Can't imagine how much torture it will be for those who play often to find new elements. I would not recommend this game at all. It's painfully borin
__label__1 This seems like one of those games where it's stupid and you'll just end up leaving it out of your carousel (meaning never seeing it again) but then you start playing it, then you get mad because you can't find another match, so then you play it again...
__label__1 No force close what so ever.  Fun, but wouldn't be worth 3 dollars for alchemy.  gd guv if. u h
__label__1 fun. simple. addictive. You will find yourself playing for hours. Tell your friends and get yours now! Get Doodle Devil too!
__label__1 Personally I love this game. It's really fun but too easy for me. I restarted the whole game 3 times already and the Doodle God 2 needs to come on Amazon.
__label__0 This app deservices five stars. but it wont let me play it! I would buy this app, but instead I want to throw my kindle.
__label__1 I had the same problem as everyone else; I made about fifty elements and after that it would force close. But Lo! and behold, at 12:50 AM, an update came in that fixed the whole thing! No more force close! I am thinking about getting the other two.
__label__1 Edit: Update fixed it, great game!!Great game until you get about 20-30 minutes in, then it force closes every time you try combining elements. Clear data resolves, but you've lost your progress at that point and eventually it'll do the same thing. I hop
__label__1 you guys make that so fun but you need to make some easier ones because I tried something and it didn't work then I asked for a hint and it gave me it
__label__1 so far my favorite good game theirs a lot to do fun pretty good except it keeps crashing but they'll fix it I'm sure
__label__0 Great game until I reached about 27 elements and now I can't play it, it keeps crashing - force close every time I select a second element. It would have been 4-5 starsif it worked. Please fix it...
__label__1 If you like zed's alchemy you'll find doodle god to be very similar. I personally like this one better because its more visually appealing and has quests, but other than that they are exactly the same. I don't now if zed's alchemy is in the amazon app st
__label__1 I am totally addicted to this game. there are challenging parts but the hints help. I love this game and I would recommend getting it. I didn't have it long before I found I was unable to put it down. AMAZING GAME!
__label__1 I loved this game and wish it would have been possible not to cheat but it's impossible to experiment because of the force close problems...I'm on a kindle fire...but I want to see this issue fixed because its really a great game
__label__1 it is a really fun and addictive game. the only problem is when it forces closed. so, if i was you i would probably update it and see if it does it again!!!!!!
__label__0 This game is great...for about the first hour. Then the closures start to happen. tried uninstall / reinstall, problem still exists. If fixed would be 5 stars.
__label__1 no FC here on kindle fire. it's neat.  my kids would love this. thanks for the Faotd. this is worth its price if I'd have paid for it.
__label__1 I got this game maybe three or two days ago and I haven't stop playing this game very addiciting and it work perfect on my kindle fire did not even force close once... I better knock on wood now
__label__1 this game is really cool!!!!! there is so much to do- elements and creating them. it works perfectly on my kindle fire!!!!!!!!! thank you amazon
__label__1 this is a really great game to pass the time or for anything but i wish they gave you more extra hints.
__label__1 I loved this casual game and recommend it to anyone. You combine elements like water, fire, dirt to make new things and after you have completed most of the game there is more things that open up to you to do.
__label__1 this is a great game it really is more of a puzzle game than any other but its actually fun,  its challenging but if you cant figure it out it gives you helpfull hints its really fun
__label__1 I love this game. It has a kids safe mode so everyone can be a God! A total must-have. You should get it.
__label__1 I have tried this on my Kindle Fire. It works great and the bonus games are equally fun. Great for kids, but be sure to child lock it or they will see one really bad thing. But other than that, it's great to use logic to create eliments and eventually cr
__label__1 This app is so addicting. Some of the combinations are like obvisious. But some of the other combinations you never would think of.
__label__1 This game is pretty awesome!  Cant wait till the next update comes out. My favorite game on my kindle fire!
__label__1 this app is so great a great time passer for when your waiting for sleep or just have some time to waste loved nonlinear love it on my kindle
__label__1 I just got the full version,  and then the void just came. Now I have a glitch, all words are gone. I can't see the hint timer, no idea how many elements I have, it just won't show up. I'm only putting 5 stars so that I can get the update
__label__1 Before the update today, I was getting the force close message but now that they had an update that fixed that problem, it is an awesome game again!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
__label__0 All you do is touch two things to combine them. Played for 3 min fell asleep glad got it for free deleting
__label__1 Great mishmash of items which you create to make more items.Pure alchemy!Try it!All the negative reviews are lies!I had the best expieence with my kids creating all sorts of whamo that would be a time killer!I upgraded to full version!Sweet!
__label__1 I have a Stock HTC Droid Incredible 2 &amp; this App works just fine. The game itself is a more graphical version of the classic Alchemy or Genetics game. The game play is very intuitive &amp; the addition of the God storyline definitely adds a unique co
__label__0 Enjoyed the game for Incredible v.1 until, like everyone else it seems, the game decided to FC. Yet another decent game undermined by instability.
__label__1 Doodle God is a fun reworking of the old computer game Alchemy, where you added two elements together to create new things. The game is simple but addictive and has a very strong "gotta find em all" component. The thing I like about this version is the n
__label__1 it is easy to figure out but also confusing once u get more completed. the more elements u have the harder it is though. overall pretty good game
__label__1 when I got this game it was really fun but then it forced closed endlessly and was really boring. then two hours later they created an update that fixed it! talk about hard work!
__label__1 Problem fixed great gameSame problem. 28 elements and force close. Hope you fix this soon so you can get 5 stars.In your comments you asked for 5 stars to keep the updates coming. I think if you update it you will get the 5 stars coming.
__label__1 Doodle God is a wonderful fun game that has a nearly endless combinations! Its worth the money it costs. ignore the other reviews saying it closes constantly, the update fixed it COMPLETELY! this is one of the best apps ever!
__label__1 it just force closes...  :(  other than that, it's brilliant. thanks 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
__label__1 For the person who wanted Doodle God 2 I played Doodle God on the computer and then I played onother game on there called Doodle Devil.
__label__1 when I got this. I thought it was going yo be boring but its not me Paige and my bff kylee do it and it is awesome I think everyone should get this wonderful app it is really fun.
__label__0 The game description doesn't do it justice. It is the stupidist, most boring game I've ever wasted two and a half hours playing while I hoped we were building up for the main levels.  It wasn't, the game sucks.
__label__1 FINALLY!!! UPDATE AVAILABLE!!! FIXED THE FORCE CLOSE!!! WOO HOO!!! WORKS PERFECTLY NOW!!! YAY!!! I'm so glad they fixed the bug!!!
__label__1 it is very fun! I didn't have problems with force close so I guess it depends on which version you get. the newest version is probably the most updated and works very well. get this game! it is so fun and the mini games make it worth it because the game 
__label__1 I downloaded this game 3/20 and have not had any crashing issue. its fun making new elements and figuring out what you can combine to get.a certain result.
__label__1 This game is very inventive, combinations are vaired and interesting. There's always more than 1 way to get to an element and some are based more on words than common sense. For example early on if you combine fire and water you gain alcohol or 'firewate
__label__1 I am having a fun time with this game. I can't wait to see what I'll make next.The force close everyone is talking about hasn't happened.
__label__1 just amazing there is no other way to describe it if u like this game as much as I do u would get Doodle devil and Doodle farm :D
__label__0 need to make pocket frogs.  please make pocket frogs the game. make pocket frogs for the kindle please. make pocket frogs for kindle.
__label__1 Fun game. For all the complainers there is a kid mode in the settings to make it more age appropriate.
__label__1 I'm getting so sick of these apps that don't work, thinking of ditching the Kindle Fire for something with less restrictions and hassles. You're gonna lose me Amazon if you don't start investing in getting more good apps for this market.  UPDATE: The dev
__label__0 I liked the game a lot until the forced close issues,  well forced me to uninstall it.  I hope someone reads the reviews and fixes this fun game.
__label__1 This is a cool game. It is harder than it looks. There is currently a crash problem but I am sure it will be fixed with next update. This is sort of a puzzle type game and I love this type of a game on phones and tablets.
__label__0 Same results as others. Pretty fun, but closes about 20 minutes in. Also, any idea why it needs to read phone calls in permissions?
__label__0 Doodle God is one of the worst games I have seen yet..Match the elements to create your own world or go on mini Quests..First, it forced closed on us two times during the opening sequence..Boring and repetitious gameplay matching the same elements or til
__label__1 I was hesitant to download this, since so many reviews said it constantly force closes, but I haven't had any issues with it in the past hour or so...This is a great game, and I would recommend trying it out yourself before immediately dismissing it, bec
__label__1 very well done,so interesting to play and give time away if it has some extra boring time . a a a a
__label__0 DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS APP.I was stupid, and bought it, just to find out I wasted my money. Even if it is free, don't get it. They don't e even warn you of some of the things that are on there. This is not a game for kids.IT'S NOT WORTH IT.
__label__0 Fix please, constant force close makes this doodle god game no fun. Fix please, constant force close makes this doodle god game no fun
__label__1 This is something to do when you are board or you just want to do something. I love to play this game. If you bought this one then get Doodle Devil or Doodle Farm they are great games to.
__label__1 The update finally fixed the force close for the game. I am using a droid 2 global. The game is simple and fun for hours. I would recommend it to anyone who loves mind games.
__label__0 I loved this gamefor my Pc, so I was excited for it to be the faotd yesterday. However after playing for the last day I am very disappointed. It worked for thefirsg 30-40 combinations but now everytime I try to combine elements now it force closes. updat
__label__1 I love Alchemy type games, and Doodle God is really quite awesome for the genre. I've been playing it for hours on my Kindle Fire, to the point that I've run the battery down and need to recharge. It's really quite fun and very well done. I must've downl
__label__0 From the start this app offends my Christian Beliefs.  The permissions seem to be a bit much and the music is at best an annoyance.  If you are a person of Biblical Faith, or anyone who just enjoys a good game, skip this loser.  The whole premise of this
__label__0 Even though the all seeing eye represents the power of satan (I did not invent that),  I had a feeling I was going to be very disappointed. This 'God' created the earth similar to the way of the bible. That is repulsive that amazon sees the whole opening
__label__1 I have had this game for a long time and i love it it is the best game i have had on my kindle my brothers and sisters love this game to they have on thier kindles to this Game is amazing i personly would like more updates and more levels and i would lik
__label__1 Love this game. I see people complaining about fc a lot but I don't have that problem at all on my Kindle Fire. It's running great!
__label__1 So much fun, really smart, funny, and so addicting.  I completed it today. There's no one formula to use, the rules keep changing as the game progresses. Some combinations are very literal, some are imaginative - it makes it much more interesting. Even m
__label__1 this game was awesome. tons of fun. I could not stop playing it. can't wait to download the next game.
__label__1 It was marvelous! I found myself racking my brains trying to discover what I could combine to create elements unknown to me in this game! Currently, I'm about halfway through. I started with four elements. Air, water, fire and earth. that was several day
__label__0 Downloaded it, played for 5 minutes and then it started force closing on me over and over and over. I can replicate the force closes every time. Restarting my Kindle changes nothing. Horribly broken piece of software. Doesn't anyone do quality control on
__label__0 Downloaded to my Kindle Fire HD, but wouldn't start and told me that I would need to download it again. Downloaded it again to the same problem. That's OK though. After the second try, I remembered how boring this game is.
__label__0 I installed the app and I've tried to open it and it goes through half the stuff about how doodle god created the earth and it freezes and stops working. It won't work on my kindle hd! I want a refund or at least the  game fixed.
__label__1 I played the flash game version before, but this one is far superior. There are even more elements and game modes. And it runs well on Kindle Fire.
__label__0 43 before force close, what's your highest score. please let us know when you fix this app, replay value would be moderate, time invested would be well spent.
__label__0 using kindle fire this program crashes most immediately. too bad its an amusing game. supposedly you can get a more up to date. version on google
__label__1 I chose this rating because, Its fun to make the elements and when you get hints you make things that you never thought you could make. get this game for free and I promise you will not get bored
__label__1 This is the best game to have fun with.I love it.the best game on the market I got it when it was free.
__label__0 would have gone 5 stars.  I had a lot of fun with this until force close issue.  didn't read reviews first since it was the free app of the day, so didn't have a warning.  I'd have thought amazon would actually check that an app works before offering it 
__label__0 been any good faotd in the past month??? seriously most of these apps are garbage and out of date already free on another market..waste of time
__label__0 Ive played this before on computer and its a really fun game so I was really estatic when it was the faotd but it is terrible on kindle fire. It force closes all the time so 1 star until seriously updated.
__label__0 ... ... ... force closed once now that is all that it does... will change rating when fixed. razr maxx ... ... ... ... ...
__label__1 I really like this game because it makes you think and its creative in a way. Its also fun and entertaining, I love this game
__label__1 I attend Holy Mary Mother of God parochial school and just got the devil whipped out of me for playing this game in Bible study. Not only did the headmistress take my phone and hold me down while the headmaster whipped me, but I was told if I was ever ca
__label__1 did 64 combinations on my Kindle Fire and it worked fine. There is a list function which will show the last several combinations. Cute and entertaining.
__label__1 This app DOES NOT HAVE ANY FORCE CLOSES!!!! I really have NEVER had ANY force closes. Seriously, I really don't know what you guys are talking about because there IS NO FORCE CLOSES!!!
__label__0 I opened this app and saw a butterfly once on a level. I opened it up again, and it was a swarm of locusts! and all of the water turned to blood, too. danger...
__label__1 I enjoyed this game a lot and is very entertaining. I would recommend this game to friends!  :)If you like this game then you'll love Doodle Barnyard and Doodle Devil. They should make Doodle Fantasy!!!!!
__label__1 I LOVE THIS APP.BEST APP EVER.It force closed a lot but somehow it fixed its self.How do you play episodes?
__label__0 pisses me off big time.just when you start getting into the game, it starts crashing (force close) and you find you cant move forward anymore.if this had been a paid app, i would demand a refund.thankfully it was the free app today.if they rescript this 
__label__0 I love this game but this app sucks big time. it keeps force closing and I cant even play it. I fell cheated. hopefully they will fix this app and it can be played to its completion.
__label__0 Game is a bad rip off of Alchemy, which is far superior to this garbage, the game teases other chapters or modes but doesn't explain how to access them. App really isn't worth a try, 2.5 stars as an average review is too generous.
__label__1 I loved it I was able to get going really fast. Also the hints helped me through times that I was confused in. I also really like the extra quests along the way. Yes it's easy toPlay because I beat it in under a week.
__label__0 awwww man! i was so excited when i got this app. for the first 10 minutes it worked fine! then it started forcing close every time i tried to combine 2 elements and nothing happened. (which is 90% of the time) i even powered off my kindle and it still wo
__label__1 this is the best app ever it is funny it is stoopid. but in the good way I love this app
__label__1 my review for this app is further in this but I.feel.like I need to talk to the people who complain first. A. you need to rate these apps based on gameplay and your opinion not how well it works. B. it is okay to talk about it but when more than 100 peop
__label__1 I kept hearing about the problem with force closing in this game, but I decided to buy it when I saw reviews about it being supposedly fixed. The game works great, does not force close at all and the quests are fun, too. Its a nice puzzle game and quite 
__label__1 I almost didn't download this and that would have been a shame. I have already played this over an hour and had no troubles on my kindle fire.
__label__0 It makes me sad that an app is created (it did not evolve) that makes us want to be a god. Why can't we seek the true god, who is God.. Yet, thanks for the free app.
__label__0 this app will allow me to buy it but it wont let me download it...kinda weird so there for it sucks
__label__1 I love this I learned so much.  I wonder if I put blank and blank together this might happen. Doodle God is the best
__label__1 this game is the ballet I'm supposed to be.get it because it's cool and stuff.I haven't had any problems mentioned in other reviews.
__label__0 like reviews, this app worked well for ten or fifteen minutes on my fire. then it started force closing everytime I tried to combine two elements. if they could fix this bug, then this app would be great. till then its just worthless.
__label__0 cant even pl&aacute;y due to this issue!! plz fix so we can enjoy the game. that's all I have to say about this
__label__1 I saw a few complains about the app crashed on KF but I decided to give it a try anyway and it works great.  I love this game.  The introductory is good.  The graphic is great.  The music is just right. It will stay on my KF for awhile.
__label__0 Like the title says, the issue with the force closing down right ruins this little game. I was genuinely intrigued until it started force closing on me. Now, as soon as I try to combine an element, it force closes on me.I would be more than happy to give
__label__0 I don't trust Russian or Chinese apps. This is boring and has shady elements also not fun at all. I don't recommend.
__label__1 I had fun playing this morning till it kept force closing..I checked and they updated...and fast too probably for all the complaints..too bad it got bad reviews because of the glitches. I cant wait till it finishes installing!
__label__1 Doodle God is a game where u create &quot;elements&quot; such as airplanes or cars. this is one of my favorite apps which seems very fun to me. I love this app
__label__1 When I saw the game, it just looked like a easy game.y but as I got into the game,it looked fun and addicting. And I was right and right now, I'm on episode 2, with 111 creations and 15 groups too.
__label__1 A totally unique fun game. I always only get free apps. Don't deny a lot of you don't do the same. After I played this free version, I HAVE to buy the full version.
__label__1 In my opinion it's great because you can turn off all the inappropriate stuff in the settings and you can make cool things great for a 9 year old :D
__label__1 Doodle God is the originalnal game That I saw on Kong many many years ago. Still the game is still awesome!!!
__label__0 this game got good reviews so I gave it a try and I'm very disappointed! I got it on my kindle fire and I got about halfway through the game and it all of a sudden started to force close and I'm getting fed up so I deleted it because it isn't worth it. I
__label__1 FUN GREAT LOVE IT BEST GAME EVER. SUPER FUN. SO GLAD IT BECAME FREE BUY THE APP. IT IS SOOO SO SO MUCH FUN. GREATTHE BEST GAME EVER
__label__1 I really didn't expect to be impressed by this game, but it is really a lot of fun and hard to put down. I have had no issues so far on my kindle fire. very clever game!
__label__1 reading the reviews made me hesitate. I have had no issues whatsoever on my kindle fire. a fun game that makes you think, so go ahead and try it. very entertaining!
__label__1 The latest update has fixed the force-close issue for me.  I'm enjoying the punny combinations again.  Thanks for the excellent customer service.
__label__1 I love this app. It is amazing, I have a Kindle Fire and it works perfectly! Please make the Doodle Devil free for a day too! This will make all of my friends jealous, thank you for making this app. I can honestly say this would ne my favorite app of all
__label__0 it keep force closing it sucks o my god it sucksasfx scar faced dxfd deft cerf sdg dcx adj jhddj idjj
__label__1 I was looking for Pocket God awhile ago and saw this app I finnaly got money so I got the trial. Cool decided to get the full game. Awesome! what's with the bad reviews you can turn off the bad stuff I'm a kid but I'm not all immature awesome game seriou
__label__1 There are many glitches with the game.Some elements you combine cause the game to crash.Can you fix this? Also the game is amazing!
__label__0 This app is awful.  All you do is combine things.  I got this app for free and it is not even worth that! You would have to pay me to play this... it is AWFUL!!!!!

__label__0 Does not work on my kindle, even after repeated attempts... Maybe a software glitch???
__label__1 I use this app on my Kindle Fire HD. I've found it to be quite helpful in accessing files i need to review or share.
__label__1 Box has its issues on the pc, but the android app is just what you would think it was, an app to download files to the android.
__label__1 I use all the time for my files and projects. Easy to use and it's free (right now).  Thank you.
__label__1 Everyone with a Kindle should have a Box account and this app. The hard drive is smallish, but Box helps out with file storage.
__label__1 this is a great app and for a limited time until march 23 you get fifty gigs for the rest of your life. jump on this one quick boys cause greatest deal on the kindle app market. it also works great with my app manager.
__label__1 Between Dropbox, Sugarsync, and Box - Box is the best. I got 50GB of free storage instead of just 5GB because of a free promotion. That's 10x more than Sugarsync and 25x more Dropbox. Box has way more features and is the most secure. Love it!
__label__1 This is a great application!  Easy enough to set up and use and makes transferring files between your PC, Mac, iPad, etc. easy and painless&#8230;&#8230;.and the base application is free.  For business use, added space is inexpensive and you can share th
__label__1 Service on par with any of the other cloud-based storage services available right now. can upload lots of file types, integration with Microsoft Office and other web apps is an interesting idea, I have yet to explore that fully.
__label__1 great cloud storage app, now more than ever since for a limited time through March 23rd you get 50GB free for lifetime if you sign up. excellent with the limited space on the kindle fire and makes it easy to sideload apps you've backed up from you androi
__label__1 I tried this cloud storage after I tried dropbox first and hands down. If you can use a place that gives you free 50 gig account and a pretty descent amount of options to do with your music ,movies,or even programs whatever you would like to do with the 
__label__1 Has plenty of free room and board, lol.. Nothing but the best!. I use this with &quot;File Expert&quot; to back up none amazone files... If you haven't heard, go check out my review list for nothing but &quot;Must Haves&quot; for KF users. You have a app
__label__1 Great product for sharing vids and pics... great holding place for vids you don't want to store on your phone
__label__0 I could not get this to work.  ODdly, after several attempts, it was still a mystery.  Dropbox worked much better.
__label__1 Great app to store and use doc's and pictures across all your devices.  I have used Box and Dropbox and they are about the same to me.
__label__1 If you sign up with an LG device, you get 50GB of storage. For free? Yes, sir! Other than throwing a few files on there from time to time, there isn't much I use this for so it suits me just fine.
__label__1 Very happy with box on my kindle fire hd.  Performs exactly as expected. I was able to post a PowerPoint on box and then view the presentation on my Kindle even though there is no PowerPoint App on the Kindle.
__label__1 I collaborate with my band mates using this app. I'll record some stuff and upload it to box and that way they can check out what I'm writing. I signed up for Box when they were having the 50gb of free storage for lifetime so if that deal is still going 
__label__1 I can access my Box and Dropbox accounts through my QuickOffice Pro app.  That avenue doesn't work if I want to download onto the local memory.  The Box app allows me full access to Box files and will let me download into the device.  Very handy if you'r
__label__1 I use this program consistently! Works great with my Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1, laptop and desktop. Best app for sharing jobs!
__label__1 A great cloud solution for backing up, sharing, storing and viewing anywhere...your files etcetera. Try it now, you'll like it forever.
__label__0 I don't know if BOX even works on Kindle Fire. I downloaded from Amazon app store &amp; installed it, but have NEVER BEEN ABLE TO LOG IN! It's been a few weeks now, I emailed support but no response!! Whenever I try to log in with my email/password it sa
__label__1 This works great all my pictures and files are saved and its good app I use it all time. There is never an issue easy to use
__label__1 Someone wrote that you can't upload multiple files at once with the free version. That is incorrect. You can. There's an option to do just that. I use it all the time. This is a great service - and I only have the free account! The only problem I have wi
__label__1 This is easy to set up and easy to use. I installed it on my laptop and my Kindle with no problem. I don;t use it often since I have a few other cloud apps, but it's a good overflow to share projects with other users. In case you don't get it, this is li
__label__0 I thought this was &#34;Dropbox&#34; before I realized what it really was.  I since uninstalled it from my Kindle and from my Cloud.  I like &#34;Dropbox&#34; better.  Now if I can just figure out how to cancel my Box account, I'd be really happy.  Anyon
__label__1 How can you go wrong with free storage. I have to admit I've gotten more use from dropbox in the past but seeing how box has recently added sycing with their desktop app I think dropbox has some real competition now.
__label__0 keeps saying sso token is bad when signing in through google 2 step verification on kindle fire.  please fix soon.
__label__0 ties up the computer does not work and Norton does not recommend it because of the lack of use by its people
__label__1 I have 50 GB Box storage and this is awesome. I have tons of music files, power-point, word docs. Easy to upload, and access on the go. Never had issues. combines with Pogoplug app, and Google Drive, this solves private/public cloud infrastructure for my
__label__1 I use dropbox as well. Never can have enough storage, especially when you have a Kindle Fire.They are running a special promote right now for 30 days.. you get upgraded to 50 GB of storage for lifetime for fee. Don't miss out on this!
__label__1 This app is a great way to connect in between devices from Kindle Fire to your home computer & it sync. very well.  I was able to set it up very quickly and it works well to stay organized from the office to home, and to be able to look at important file
__label__1 Just being honest.  I use Box but also use other cloud storage, one for Apple, and one for Microsoft and find all three to be about the same for ease, accessibility and value.  I have never pushed the limits on any of them and I have not shifted to their
__label__1 This is pretty much like the other mobile Box apps. There really arent many ways you can mess up a cloud storage app. It's easy to use and great for those you use cloud storage.
__label__1 And easy way for me to save important files or photos and not have to ever worry about losing them. No lost jump drives, destroyed CD's, or crashed hard drive to lose my precious information.
__label__1 This app works very well and I am able to sync my Tablet, Cell Phone, & Computers to each other and sync to the cloud. Sharing is very simple to do as well. I signed up for the free 5GB and Box ended up giving me lifetime 50GB for free! They also gave me
__label__1 this is a good working app that worked on my phone worked on my tablet worked on with my computer
__label__1 This is the ideal package for anyone with multiple computers, smart cell phones, or e readers.  You can back up everything and then access it through all devices.  Very nice.
__label__1 Great way to store stuff off your device.  Also makes it much easier to side load apps to devices they are not normally available to.
__label__1 Easy to get along with and use. passes things from one device to the next easily. Could not be more simple to use
__label__1 easy to use with simple windows and mac integration; also using with iPhone and Kindle HD. and finally my  50 GB Box storage is awesome.
__label__1 I have Box on all of my mobile devices and like the ease of use. I also use other storage programs but Box compliments them well.
__label__1 I really love how it teaches u all the different Greek names and such I think all Greek fans should get it
__label__1 I never studied Greek Mythology in school but I definitely had an interest for the basics, so this app is perfect.  The app maker has a few interesting apps, I have purchased just about all of them.  For $1.00 per app, how can you go wrong.This type of a
__label__0 It's boring and was a waste of money.I would not recommend this app.  Very little info and like I said..... boring.
__label__1 Very fun. It is a pretty simple and addictive game. Good for passing the time.-Samsung InterceptThere is no reason for a 1 star review.
__label__1 I have abduction! which is super fun,ive also played the demo.they both work great on my fire.I cant wait till its free again cuz my parents said it has 2 be free
__label__1 A simple premise that is hard to master.  That being said it has a kids mode you can only jump up from. Perfect for letting your kids entertain them selves with worrying about them getting frustrated and hitting your phone.
__label__1 This app was a lot of fun, It took a little while to beat but it was fun the whole way.... First Abduction was a lot of fun too but this 1 I think is way better.
__label__1 Go to settings and turn hi def mode to make it look a whole lot better. Great game to waste time with.
__label__0 title screen is okay, but all of the other screens are messed up.  shame since i played andenjoyed the first one
__label__1 I really loved the first game, and this one is just as good, but with some more fun features.  I've enjoyed every minute I've played this game!
__label__0 This is a rip off of Doodle Jump Gamehpuse. I would like to give it a good review but this is merely a knockoff
__label__1 fun addicting game.  So much fun I could not stop playing even while laying in my hammock, I tilted the phone so much I went flying out.
__label__1 It is a simple and fun game.  I would not mind to pay $0.99, but it is free today, you have to get it.
__label__1 very fun time killer. i had the free version and it was amazing! so glad its free today. the developers really did a great job on this game.
__label__1 It's better than the original and just so damn charming! Doodle jump are very similar, but my loyalties lie with this one.
__label__1 Loads of fun,  looks better than doodle jump.  I like the customizable animals. Also this game has a good campaign mode.
__label__1 Fantastic app to get for free thanks to Amazon! I would have happily paid if I knew how fun this was. Doodle Jump may be a bit more polished, but this game has so much more to do... Fun fun fun!
__label__1 I have all of the Abduction games, and this one is every bit as good as the others.The thing I like the most about it is the fact that you can load it up, play a couple of levels, then put it away all in a matter of minutes.  Perfect for on the go gaming
__label__1 This game is a bit repetitive, but perhaps there's only so much you can do in a game where you bounce around using the accelerometer. Taken for what it is, it is an excellent game, though, and I can see myself wasting quite a bit of time on a bus with th
__label__1 Improved graphics and game play from the original version, but still the same great game.  New features like trampolines are fun.I don't know why, but a lot of people like to troll the daily free game.  Perhaps they are developers of other games that are
__label__1 We've had Abduction for a long time as a not-quite-perfect substitute for Doodle-jump, so I didn't expect much out of this, but it's so fun! My son absolutely loves visiting the different countries and purchasing items at the "store". This is a really go
__label__1 I figured I would hate the game but once I started playing it, and I played it again and again till I couldn't get any further in the game. very fun!
__label__1 Great game especially for free! Get it now and you will not regret it. Stupid twenty word limit needs to go.
__label__1 I think this is the best game ever. I play it all the time and love jumping up and down. What better way to spend your time than save adorable animals. Best way to spend your time other than playing volleyball.
__label__0 white box covering the screen. can not be played. otherwise works great on phones. I loved the original version of the game.
__label__1 Just for the fact that this game uses profiles is 5 stars ! Now my whole family can compete for high scores! I really don't know why all games can't do this.This game is very fun also! Love the excelerometer use!
__label__0 As of 2/7/12 this app doesn't work. it closes unexpectedly as I get to the main menu. my kindle has been a problem since I dropped it but all my other apps seem to be mine. would give it 5 stars but it doesn't work on my Fire tablet.
__label__1 Who doesn't love bouncing a cow around.  Wait, that doesn't sound right. But the game is great and I really enjoyed it.
__label__0 what uh umm why when uh huh ummmm wtd what the heck.. all i have to say one sensible word about this app  SUCKS  dont waste your time with this. this is goofy game uninstall within seconds after playing
__label__1 This is the cutest game, ever. It's especially useful for killing time in queues and other similar situations, simple colourful gameplay, and it doesn't even need two hands or even your thumb - yay! And I have yet to see anything cuter than a cow wearing
__label__1 I originally had the first ones free trial which I loved. And being able to get the sequel for free is great. Yes it's a lot of repetition, but it gets harder and more rewarding with unlockable content and characters.The reason I like it more than Doodle
__label__0 again: why does a game need permissions like reading my identity and internet access. I don't install such apps and give them automatically one star. We should teach them that spying doesn't pay.
__label__1 The original Abduction was a great game, and they managed to find a way to improve on it. I already bought this on the Droid marketplace, but I still can't complain. Great job, developers, keep up the good work, and props to Amazon on a very worthwhile f
__label__1 Fun, simple game! Worth the time to download, great to play when you have a few spare minutes.  Not much else to say.
__label__0 I really wanted to like this one. When it pauses for an incoming call, it breaks and needs a force close. Also while playing, the screen cleared (no cow or platforms, except for the end which was half off the screen and too early).  Finally Feint sucks. 
__label__1 I haven't gotten this app but im writing in response to people who has and is giving the game low rating because they purchase the game too early.  i encountered that the other morning but was smart enough to WAIT you monkies! why would you go ahead and 
__label__1 this app is fun and easy to use...photography &amp; collage are hobbies of mine...having the ability to make collage on my kindle fire is great!  another great app for expressions of creativity!
__label__0 Keeps crashing and freezing up. up It will not let me add an image for the background. Now it won't return my money!!!! Very disappointed.
__label__1 GREAT app. Developer has been very responsive over time as I've raised questions or made suggestion. I highly recommend this app!
__label__1 This app is great for someone who loves pictures like me.It's very easy unlike some other apps. I recommended to anyone,you won't regret it and it's free.
__label__0 the first time i used it it was awsome! then everytime i clicked on it it said you must forclose. waste of money.
__label__1 it is so fun I love it and so dose my sister we have a lot of fun on this and I think you should like it to
__label__1 This is an old version of this app. I checked on Google Play and it has been updated - VERSION 20120405 was done on April 5, 2012. I wrote to the developer and hopefully he will send the updated app to be tested by Amazon - then Amazon will offer us the 
__label__1 This isn't the type of game I normally play. That being said, I just played this game for 6 hours straight. Good graphics and controls. Fairly easy to figure out with a small learning curve. Totally worth 99c.
__label__1 This game is addicting and very in depth. Got it as the free app of the day and would totally have paid over 5$ for it. I do wish the icon buttons were a little bigger but you get the hang if it. This is currently by guilty pleasure. Great time passer if
__label__0 Confusing and undocumented gameplay, lack of instructions, and no description of the game controls made this app unusable.  I'm uninstalling it.
__label__1 with great graphics. some if the people here are complaining about this app being free on the android market. OK? I guess their time is precious and expensive  to whine about getting a FREE game.Just starting playing the game and it is okay. it works on 
__label__1 usually don't leave reviews, but i'm addicted to this game. At first, a little confusing as to what to do, but after two levels of the campaign, i couldn't get enough.
__label__1 all the praise and complaints of the top rated reviews really cover this app quite well.  there is quite a learning curve and trial by error, but if you stick with it the game certainly begins to shine.  Townsmen reminds me of Age of Empires for the PC. 
__label__1 I have been waiting to play an app like this. It is a great concept and it's fairly well executed, except some of the interface is very hard to hit with my fingers. This is a very fun game in that they fix the few bugs it does have then it will just be a
__label__0 It wont download on my kindle fire I deleted three apps turned it off and nothing just the Sam error saying installation failed try shin so don't get waste of mouney
__label__0 Reading through the instructions, rules, and regulations takes forever!  Who could take the time to memorize all this AND have a LIFE?????
__label__1 you guys don't know the difference between paid and free apps all I have to say is god help them for they know not what they do .  you're trying to say that amazon is trying to pull something over on us . for me it's a great game without the adds unlike 
__label__1 Super fun addicting game!  Sorta reminds me a little bit of Age of Empires!  But overall a fun addicting game!
__label__1 This takes a little -- well, a lot, really -- time getting used to the controls. But after getting that down the game is a lot of fun, challenging, and quite the addicting little time-suck. Campaign mode is great to play and it is nice to drop into the o
__label__0 this game makes it very hard to understand basic gameplay and gives me a headache due to poor graphics. developers could have done better.
__label__1 Works great on droid x. Different but lots of fun. As to the previous review, there's a free ad-supported version of the same game on android market. The paid version there currently costs $1.36 our something like that
__label__1 at least 6 months ago when I scooped this title it was free on the android market. I don't know when they started charging. none the less this is a great game. easy to learn and the difficulty ramps up nicely. updated frequently too. half sim city/ half 
__label__0 Glad that I never paid for this because it would've been a waste of money. There was a lot of potential in this game but it was all thrown aside by a shoddy amateur dev. Game interaction is nearly impossible and there is nothing intuitive here. In other 
__label__1 This was absolutely the most infuriating game to figure out, that I didnt uninstall immediately.I have had it about seven months. I keep playing it.Little changes make big differences, like what if I start my first farm with all meat, or build my manor h
__label__1 At first I was bored with it because learning how to play is never too fun, but once I got used to it, it became the best game ever (for Android)Highly addictive, fun and plays well usually.
__label__1 This game is addictive. flawless on vizio tablet, single core. Think of the pc game &quot;Civilization Revolution &quot;. Graphics are breath taking, I can't believe how it looks better than most of pc games, and consoles games that cost upwards of 64.00
__label__1 I found this game to be very in debth for an app. I have been addicted for the last few hours.The game doesn't come with very clear instructions so it takes some patience to figure out what you need to do. I feel like I had a little better time than some
__label__1 And it's not just because I used to teach French!  This is a creative, challenging game that starts off very basic.  Mastery of the game takes a while - I played it through to the end of the campaign mode at least 5 times before learning enough to conque
__label__1 This game is both challenging and addicting! As a fan of some of the older strategy games, this is the first android game to even come close to meeting my expectations.
__label__1 I like this game, it's both entertaining and fun. It's not fast enough like an arcade action game that requires a power hungry processor so it saves the battery at the same time. I'd like to see more these RPGs, specially in the historical category that 
__label__1 we could have a game with real people since I am really sick/of the cartoon folks. not downloaded for that reason but had to rate to mention my issue. real people can make a game better for many adults.
__label__1 one of the best mobile games out there. engaging enough to keep you entertained for hours. definitely worth five stars
__label__1 been having some weird dreams lately this really helped me make sense of my dream and what ike feeling very relieving to know and have my subconscious make better sense of events and how to solve problems in my life awsome app
__label__1 it told me more about myself.gets right to the point.also u search for keywords that were in ur dream.I'm keeping this 1.it tells the meaning of ur dreams u had.great app.
__label__1 I really love this dream app it pin pointed my dreams as soon as I found out what kind of dream I was having and I've looked up for other people too and it hit it right on the dot
__label__0 I tried to install this app but a message came up stating Cannot install. Dream Dictionary has been corrupted. So yeah. Can't offer up a review on this one. Anyone else have this problem?
__label__1 I really like looking up things in my dreams on this app. there is a lot of words although there are some that I couldn't find usually I can find a lot of the ones Im looking up. some of it actually makes sense as to why I dreamt that but other times it 
__label__1 Just what I wantedjust how I wanted itI would recommend it to everyonein perfect condition I love it
__label__0 This app really doesn't really tell you what ur dream means. If u want a good dream app get dream jourounal.
__label__0 Very poorly put together,not visually appealing at all.plus you have tons of advertisements popping up where it takes your eyes off of what you were searching for in the first place.thankfully it was free because if I'd of payed for this I'd be pissed.ri
__label__0 99% of what I look up isn't there, not even most colors!  Don't waste your time with this one. Dream Catcher is better, not great, but better than this.
__label__1 I am a very vivid dreamer and so it is a kick to look up what the meaning may or may not be!  SOmetimes, it is right on the money :)
__label__1 This can let you load all your basic health care needs for an emergency. On my kindle, it has a special lock feature that health care professionals can access without your pass code.
__label__1 Unlike my Samsung S4, the HTC Droid DNA seemed to have no option for displaying your information on the lock screen or letting someone who found your phone simply dial another number of yours to let you know they have it.This app solved that problem.I ac

__label__1 looks good on the kindle fire...ideal for students. really nice free app. While you cqn get all this from google.com but this gets you there in fewer steps.
__label__1 if you want a periodic table for reference, here ya go. Straight, to the point, easy to use. Thanks guys!
__label__1 It is complete and easy to understand. I like the feature of alphabetically finding the elements to learn in details about them.
__label__1 This Periodic Table app is a very handy way to quickly view the Periodic Table. The app has an easy to use interface that allow you to select an element to get the pronunciation (clearly speaks the name) and it's properties. It also supports a search fun
__label__1 This is a great application, everything just works great, and is so useful for studying the periodic table, I use it in all the time and all the people will look me with envy, with their old-fashioned paper periodic tables, while we work with them.AWESOM
__label__1 Not only a table, but learning resources come with it as well. It's great for studying, it's an essential for chemistry.
__label__1 I'm not a scientist or educated man but from a dirty faced old man's view - this is a pretty good record of what common folk need to remind them of what &#34;The Almighty&#34; built along time ago.
__label__1 Has everything I need in a small package. A really good reference app for your phone or tablet that can deliver all of the elements you could possibly need. I have it on my smartphone and my kindle. Never any problems with function, no funny permissions 
__label__1 The Periodic Table app installed and ran fine on my Kindle Fire. It worked well in both portrait and landscape modes. As a retired engineer, I don't really need a handy periodic table, but as a science lover, I've always been fascinated by them.This peri
__label__1 I am not a chemist so my opinion may not be as spot on as someone with more experience. I found this app to be very useful and complete for what it is. I would have liked the option to sort/identify according to various element properties, such as conduc
__label__1 This is a great resource for anyone interested in chemistry, physics, etc.  You not only have the periodic table but clicking on any element reveals a wealth of information.  And their are videos and other interesting information for anyone at any level.
__label__1 Memorizing the periodic table of the elements is a chemistry class basic.  The only way to do it is to drill, so make the drill convenient and fun with this app.  It works well on the Kindle Fire and is suitable for all ages.
__label__0 this table is inaccurate some elements aren't real labeling is horrible no halogens! do not get this app I got a C on my science test and used this app to study
__label__1 i have a few written books on this subject and they are prettier, but not as handy as this on my kindle fire.
__label__1 This app is great for the nursing students here in the hospital.  It's awesome to be able to simply pull up the resource quickly and timely.
__label__1 I'm guessing not many will need a periodic table and usually, I don't either. But there are times when I do. This was free.
__label__1 This app was well designed. I am a student and find this easy to use very helpful and gives the amount of info needed for anyone starting out studying the elements!
__label__1 this is a great help. it contains most of the information one would need and links to Wikipedia. the only thing that would make it better would be able to click on element and have the info page come up.
__label__1 As of the moment, this very well could be the best game I have on my Kindle Fire (And this is among games like Avatar and Asphalt 6).  This game is a little overpriced considering the amount of levels the game has.  However, I am very happy I bought it. 
__label__1 This game is great on kindle fire and samsung vibrant. There is no way to be disappointed with this game.
__label__1 Fun game with great visuals and sound. I was expecting to not like the auto-aim, but they handled it pretty well and the game is still challenging.
__label__0 Not compatible with the Android Velocity T301 Cruz 7-Inch Tablet as stated.  :( I guess it needs more RAM to run it.
__label__1 I tried the free version and it was good.  Distractingly good.  You always want to try just one more time to get that higher score, and it goes pretty fast, so if you mess up you can either restart of finish quick and start again.  It's a quick way to ki
__label__1 This game is really fun and I like it because there are 3 different styles of play so you don't get bored doing the same thing over and over again. Theres the timed target game, the original can knock down that gets increasingly more difficult, and what 
__label__1 I first got CK2 from Amazon for my Kindle Fire (not HD), and enjoyed it, and then got CK3 and loved it even more. Turns out someone swiped CK3 to put it on Amazon because I wrote to Infinite Dreams and found out CK3 was on Amazon illegally and that's why
__label__1 I was relieved to find this app for Kindle Fire after searching among the other options. I bought it for the sync capabilities from and to Google Calendar. It syncs both ways. I can count the apps I've actually purchased and this has been worth every dim
__label__1 When I moved to Android OS two years ago, I used Astrid for my task list and Business Calendar for my scheduling.  When Astrid went out of business a few months ago, I decided to try CalenGoo.  If I'd known it had a very powerful to-do function, I would 
__label__1 Awesome to have something calendarwise to share with my other electronics thru my gmail... I can switch between devices and still have my calendar with me
__label__1 I downloaded two other calendar apps for free to try, and just kept coming back to CalenGoo. I don't even use the Google calendar sync, so other apps would have worked, and may have cost less, but this one has all the features, reminders and customize-ab
__label__1 only app that allows me to sync my google tasks between my fire and android phone.  calender looks great and it's much better than the stock android (even the one on jelly bean)!  I would recommend this to anyone.  Great buy
__label__1 This calendar is amazing! I have it synced with my google calendar on my phone and kindle fire. I keep my to-do (tasks) list there also.  I don't know how many times it has saved my life with reminders! Spend the money...its worth it.
__label__1 Provides two way connectivity (over wifi) with Google Calendar.  Alarms and reminders and good stuff, oh My!  You need this.
__label__1 This app is more than a convenience.  I can *do* more with my life than before because Calengoo allows me to keep it all organized. I'm spending more time with my kids, I've said "yes" to volunteer opportunities, and I'm much more peaceful and happy.  It

__label__0 I rarely purchase apps, but was aggravated because I could not find a calendar that  would sync with my google account  i paid $6 for an app for my 8.9" Kindle and the calendar is so tiny i cant read it without zooming in.  I also have many of my calenda
__label__1 Communicates with all calendars (Google Calendar, Phone Calendar, etc.) Awesome widget options!I wouldn't be nearly as productive without it!
__label__1 While I don't like that I couldn't sync my google calendar onto my kindle calendar app, I'm not going to bump stars off this app for it. It's absolutely wonderful, does everything it's supposed to, and even tells you the local weather!
__label__1 Just got it today, so haven't had a chance to use it a lot, but it seems to do everything I need.  I like that the timezones are customizable.  The integrated to-do function is also very good to have.  The calendar and to-do sync very nicely with Google.
__label__1 This is exactly what I was looking for. It syncs flawlessly with my Gmail account, giving me instant access to both my calendar and my task list and it is very easy to use. I use it for my personal calendar, so I do not really need the full functionality
__label__1 I've tried many apps to give me the same functionality as the Google calendar website and they were all lacking in some way that I stopped using them.  Finally one that works and stays in sync!
__label__1 I use Google Calendar online, and this app syncs seamlessly with my online calendar. I have the same app on my phone, so no matter where I am I can see my calendar, add/delete/change events, and it will send me reminders for upcoming events. The app is e

__label__1 Calengoo does a great job in syncing with Google Calendar on the Kindle Fire.  It is wonderful because you can make appointments and you don't need to be online.  It makes it easy for my husband and I to keep track of our schedules.I'm not sure if I'll g

__label__1 I wanted a simple calendar for my Kindle to record appointments and reminders.  After trying and deleting some free ones, I splurged on this one ($5.99).  I have been very happy with it.  It allows you to view by day, week, month, and agenda format with 
__label__1 Very customizable, highly functional, more settings than I've seen in ANY app I have to date on anything!  Offline editing of calendar with sync ability was important to me, and this fits the bill and more.  Worth every penny.Works great with my Nextbook

__label__1 I was wanting to use one calendar for my two computers and our two Kimble Fire pads.  Putting these CalenGoos on the Kimbles did the trick. Now whenever one calendar is changed all calendars change.  Thanks for a great addition to the calendar world.
__label__1 Mea culpa!  Mea culpa!  I had written a previous review stating how disappointed I was that CalenGoo would not sync on my Kindle Fire.  Can you imagine, the problem was BSAK?  In the Calengoo app, I had not marked all of the appropriate calendars to disp
__label__1 it does what it says, it has a nice UI and its suitable for everyone looking for an alternative. Would recomend.
__label__1 I tried several other calendars for my kindle but although they synced on my android devices they would not sync on the kindle.  This one does!  So I'm happy.  Plus you can set email reminders which some other mobile calendar apps are missing.

__label__1 It works perfectly with my google calender and I am very satisfied with this app. Syncs just as I had hoped it would.
__label__1 I have been a big Apple user and still am. For iPhone I would update my work schedule on the calendar app and liked it for the most part. This app has the upper hand though because getting my work schedule filled out on here is super fast and painless.
__label__1 This app works great for my kindle fire. I was able to sync google calendar with it and add appointments via the app. If you set up a pop up reminder it shows in your notifications. It looks great and is easy to read.
__label__1 Love this app. It syncs between my pc and android phone and keeps me from missing important scheduled appointments and meetings that I might just otherwise forget. For some reason, it also automatically syncs with the calendar that was resident on my Sam

__label__0 Complete and total waste of my money.  I have read this was a good app for syncing with google, but I did not think it was user friendly at all.  I could not recommend it.

__label__1 Dates in color, great function.  Ties in with other calendars.  Love it.  Lots of personalization of you're into that.  I find white backgrounds the best, though and you have that option,too.

__label__1 This calendar works seamlessly with my Google calendar and syncs easily.  I keep the widget on my home page of my tablet so I can glance on current days' tasks without opening my calendar.  The full size calendar is neat and easy to use.
__label__1 If you're looking for a calendar with THAT function or THAT setting (THAT being whatever you could dream of) then this is what you're looking for. I almost didn't but it for its price, but I would pay triple now that I have slided it.Every detail I can d

__label__1 Makes all other calendars sync with no Problem ... Highlighted important things. Reminder feature.  A Plus.. Great little app for my Kindle.

__label__1 I purchased this app to sync around 10 Google calendars for this very busy house, and it does it all very well.
__label__1 Let's face it; the built-in calendar app on the Kindle Fire HD is "...really fecal like."  CalenGoo gives me the best "real Android like" calendar experience possible.
__label__1 I paid the $6 last spring and couldn't be happier w this calendar - it's my most-used app.  The task manager is the best Google front-end; and the whole interface is professional-looking and easy to use. The tech support is best I've ever had w any Droid
__label__1 This is a great calender app. You can change the colors to make it perfectly personal. You can sync it with your google calender. It has a reminder option and it works great with the Kindle Fire. I am a full time college student and I put all of my sylla
__label__1 Finally I was able to find a reliable calendar. My own gmail calendar thats free to use on everything but the Kindle. Anyways after downloading this app, my gmail calendar was on my kindle and I could update it with or without wifi and when connected to 
__label__1 This program synchronizes perfectly with Google calendar. I have the Kindle Fire. it is an excellent program!! The graphics are very good too.
__label__1 I rely pretty heavily on Google Calendar to keep track of my appointments.  When I got my new Kindle Fire HD, I decided to try to move as much of my productivity tasks to it as possible.  I hated the idea of having to enter calendar events into the Kindl
__label__1 It's easy to use and it syncs my Google calendars (both work and personal) with my Kindle, so I can look at and update the calendars at any time and I don't have to copy anything to a hard copy personal agenda.  Since I don't have a smart phone, this is 
__label__1 such a big bing fan they have a lot to offer better then google .!............... goodbye google have a nice life
__label__0 The first thing I tried was youtube and started a video. As the video was playing I added it to my bookmarks. The video was still playing. When I exited the bookmark screen control returned to the Bing home page. The video was still playing but there was
__label__1 Why just look it up, when you BING it up?This such a much needed change from Google.  Very good  site  for searching images.
__label__1 I USE BING AT WORK A LOT SO I KNEW IT WOULD BE GOOD.  I FIND IT VERY USEFUL AND HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT.
__label__1 I think I prefer bing over google to do searches.  very easy to use and is very fast in doing searches.
__label__1 Can find all information you need.. just one click.. also can ask questions and the answers are easy and quick
__label__1 Great app, I use it to surf my browser on my phone as well as on my tablet. Bing is a great explorer and has more sites that are not blocked then Google. thanks for the free app.
__label__1 This app is very useful for all my searches and is just like it would on a computer. It is also very simple and easy to find all the settings and options.
__label__1 My Kindle is able to do things on this app that it can't do on the silk browser. This app works very well.
__label__0 Would not load a map, only 1/4 of it.  I could not figure out how to get a map that I saved on my desktop (had trouble with that, too).  Not sure what benefit at all there is to having this app.
__label__0 Reults were fine but whenever you go to the page it has a Bing error that requires you to force stop Bing
__label__1 Bing is THE best search engine. The presentation format and results are superior to Google in my experience. I would lightly recommended the app
__label__1 Highly recommend.  Previously, I only used Google - then gave Bing a try - now I prefer Bing.  Give it a chance, you may prefer Bing  too.
__label__1 I just like a bing and a search engine.  I can learn so much on it.  I would use bing over any other
__label__1 I put this app on my tablet and have used it to search for many things while away from home. It has worked great.
__label__1 Love bing easy to use quick and accurate  results love that its on my droid so i can keep getting my bing points
__label__0 Don't buy this app. When I search something it does not show the results I searched for usually, but when it does I click on the site and within 30 seconds of me getting on the site, 90 percent of the time the connection times out.
__label__0 Doesn't work on my Kindle.  Apparently you can't repeat yourself on these ratings so in another words it is not for my Kindle HDX
__label__1 I use the Bing app now to cycle my device's wallpaper whenever Bing brings in a good selection. I don't use the app itself as I use Bing from within the system and browser search but it is a nice app to have.
__label__1 Bing is one of the best search engines, but it's even better when you have Bing Rewards. I can get my rewards with the app, so it's my only search engine right now.
__label__1 This search engine is a good alternative on the Amazon Kindle.  If you don't like the default browser this works great as an alternative.
__label__1 I like this app. I have several different search engines on my Kindle Fire HD Tablet. Sometimes when I can't find what I'm looking for I'll try another search engine and then I can find what I want. It is always good to have multiple sources for your ass
__label__0 Did not like the search app. It may work better on a desktop. It did not work well for me. It was deleted.
__label__1 This app is helpful and can be fun at times It works well for my needs.. I would recommend it to everyone.
__label__1 well worth the cost, I would have paid for it but it was free! Using it on a motorola Triumph and a cheap $90 Android tablet
__label__1 This clock widget is great! I had a different widget that took up my whole screen and didn't center properly on my tablet. This widget is small and doesn't take up the whole screen, but is just the right size.
__label__1 This app does just what it's supposed to do. Gives you a digital clock widget for your home screen. I just got my android 4.0 device, and the only clock widget available for your homescreen on startup is an analog clock with no ability to change it, or a
__label__1 This is an easy to read clock that can be set up many ways.  I use it with just the time and date visible.  I can change the clock colors to contrast nicely when I change screen backgrounds.
__label__1 I got this app so I can see the date and time on my main page on my ereader. Works great and recommend to anyone who wants to use this kind of app.
__label__1 I love how this clock has big numbers so it's easy to see. Also, you can make it so it has no background to interfere with your wallpaper. Great app!
__label__1 Keep it simple stupid. simple and very affective.  my next8p tablet came with  clock/weather app that always  said the wrong time and weather. This widget provides a clean simple clock with custom color options in case you change your wallpaper you can m
__label__1 HTC thunderbolt-this is perfect size is great can customize colors and most everything about this clock, I am able to still see my backgrounds perfectly and I love the date feature as well I highly recommend definitely worth purchasing. Now working with 
__label__1 This is the clock that stays on my home screen all the time. colors are very customizable, simple, easy to read, and doesn't eat up your battery life. comes in 2 sizes. perfect.
__label__1 I installed this widget on the homescreen of my tablet, it is pretty and I have not found any operational issues since install ... it has been many weeks.
__label__1 This is just what I was looking for.  I have a Samsung Galaxy SIII, my wife has a Samsung Galaxy Note 2.  They both came with a Weather / Time widget on the Home screen.  The weather was from Accuweather, and we felt it didn't really offer enough informa
__label__0 this is a very dumb game. it is very stupid because you cant pick anything uuuuughh waste of memory I didn't follow the other people that said so, I think you should follow this.  please.
__label__0 this game is very dull. it reminded me of the paint program that is downloaded on desktop computers. only you cant choose what color to draw in. its every color all at once. a little lame
__label__1 This app is down right amazing! Any one any age would love this app! And I am a basically no rainbow person, but even I thought that this app is amazing!And even better! It's free!!!!!!!!!!!!
__label__1 I think this app is nice but when I tried to share my drawing on Facebook like the app says you can for some reason it wouldn't let me and I tried 3 times but besides that it's a good app create for all ages from kids to adults
__label__1 mega mwaha mwaha turtles love this game so much that they fart out children that are very oarnge that's my reveiw
__label__1 I have seen the pics they are so so so cool! I love art so this is a good game for me!
__label__1 This app is really cool. I love rainbows so I love this app. It is great for kids with all the pretty colors.
__label__0 All I have to say is bad application!!!!!! for real!!!! don't get don't get don't get do.t get don't get!!!!!!'
__label__1 This app is perfect for children!!!!!!Get it now I mean who doesn't like rainbows!!!! This app is awesome a-w-e-s-o-m-e.  :-)
__label__1 Another cute draw program that works on Kindle Fire.  The color is beautiful. The app is fun and easy to use.  I like this very much.
__label__0 I HATE IT!I WAS TRYING TO DRAW A DOT BUT IT DREW A LINE AND I TRIED TO DRAW A LINE BUT IT DREW A DOT!DO NOT GET THIS SILLY APP!WASTE OF TIME!DO NOT PRESS DOWNLOAD!GO GET FRUIT NINJA OR SOMETHING JUST NOT THIS!!!!THIS APP STINKS!!&gt;:0
__label__1 Great app. My son loves touching the items on the pages to hear and see the names. This story teaches a great lesson.
__label__1 This was purchased for my Kindle Fire for use with lower level elementary reading students.  The colors are great, and the narrative pleasant.  The interactive features make it more engaging for the kids and it is a wonderful treat to be able to use it w
__label__1 Loved the pictures. loved the way it kept my girls attention. it was a cute book to see and read all the way thru. My girls loved the book. They now have it on their tablets.
__label__0 this book is the worst and the app sucked my kids hated it it is a waste of money DO NOT GET OK
__label__1 We had these books for our kids, now we have them for our grandkids.  Have to find all the spiders, frogs and mice again. I love the stories and illustrations.Would buy any additional that are released.
__label__1 My granddaughter who will be 5 soon loves this app. You have choices to either just read it, have it read to you or just choose different words to have read to you.  If she's happy I'm happy.
__label__1 this is a cool app I love these books. please lower the price! everyone wants it please please lower the price!
__label__1 My son loves this app book.  I fall asleep and he stays up listening and touching on the different pictures.
__label__1 The story and illustrations were cute in this interactive book.  The narration is interesting. Players can interact by touching objects. The name of the object appears and is spoken aloud.  (I am not a fan of this feature in interactive books, but my thr
__label__1 I work with kids and the interactive ebooks are fantastic. Great teaching tool! Also great for young readers. They are captivated by the amount of interaction.
__label__1 I loved these books when I was a kid and now my 4 and 10 year olds do. It reads the story to my daughter when. I'm busy. works perfect on my kindle fire.
__label__1 Lovely story, well written. I liked its simplicity, honesty and child point of view. My daughter read it a few times already. The addition of a game in the story (finding mouse and spider) added to the interest. I liked the sounds that corresponded to ea
__label__1 Love this book, and love the price.  BUT I dont appreciate that you can ONLY have an app on ONE Kindle device.  I cant put this on my phone now because I DL'ed it to my Kindle!
__label__0 Timers4Me & Stopwatch, was not for me...another poor choice. I deleted this and have still not found one that I prefer!
__label__1 LOVE THIS APP! I am very pleased with the alarm clock. I was glad to have an alarm that allows me to select how long the snooze time is. So far I have no complaints about this app.
__label__1 I have another timer App but this one is so superior.  Easy to use. Quick to set. Very handy. I set it to remind me to start supper on time for my family, to give medication, to have a little reading time to myself, to remember a TV show I don't want to 
__label__1 I LOVE IT! It's so helpful, i love the colors and the options it has. I have all my timers in 1app. thank you.
__label__0 Did not care for this app, no special reason, just did not like it. Didn't like the features or the way it worked. A lot of better timers out there that I found.
__label__1 I use it a lot when I work out to keep track of certain exercises and it works great for me
__label__1 There's really no higher praise for an app, especially when it was free!  There's a lot of stuff on it that I haven't tried, but I use it for a medication alarm, and it's very dependable.
__label__1 Good app. Its just what I asked for. A stopwatch and a timer. Can set multiple timers with alarms so I'm game.Its really useful for excercising.
__label__1 I've been using this app since I got my Kindle fire, and have not had a single issue with it. Very useful and customizable.
__label__1 What a great tool for workouts.  I time myself for each interval of training that I do and it really helps to keep me focused on task at hand.
__label__1 I love the ability to customize numerous timers. Plus you can run multiple timers simultaneously! You've also got a good number of ringtones to choose from. I haven't used the alarm or stopwatch functions, but the timers I can highly recommend.
__label__1 I downloaded this app to my Kindle Fire HD 7&quot; and I was amazed. At the moment I can't think of anything else I would like this app to do. I have several preset and labeled timers ready to use (and they can be in use simultaneously). The alarm clock 
__label__1 I love this app. It is the same thing with Mrs. Martinez. I know how to make a baby. You.......................  :D
__label__1 This app is super useful.I have not had any trouble with it yet.I used to have a separate alarm clock, stop watch, and timer, but there is no need for that now since they are all included in this wonderful app (plus the reminders). I am always using it, 
__label__1 Dropped my kitchen timer and needed something right away.  Used the multi times and this worked nicely. I recommend highly.
__label__1 I use this app every day! As a professor at a university it is so useful in balancing work with rest. The wide variety of timers one can create is excellent.  I have about seven of them  programmed in and so far they work without hitch.  This is a great 
__label__0 If your thinking you can use this app for normal timers, think again. Its horrible no timers you can set. DON'T GET THIS APP YOU WILL WASTE YOUR TIME
__label__1 We use this timer for lots of things and I like being able to several different timers. Overall great app!!
__label__0 to hard for me to use I just wanted something simple.Maybe for a more complicated mind but not form mine.

__label__1 I am more than impressed with this timer!  Easy to use and has so many categories to. choose from.  I got a lot more than I expected.
__label__1 This is a great timer/alarm/stopwatch! I'm a heavy sleeper so I could never find an alarm that woke me up. This is LOUD and you can set the alarm to whatever sound or song that u have on your device. Now I can wake up to Zelda songs instead of the dreade
__label__1 My daughter, 7, uses this app to keep track of her reading times for school,time her math homework, and set alarms for different tasks. She literally uses it everyday. It is exactly what we wanted/needed in 1 app and more.
__label__1 I use this app on my lunch hour at work while I am reading from my Kindle Fire so that I won't have to keep watching the time.  It works very well!  Great free app!
__label__1 i love this app but why do humans have the ability off time. Becuz of time we all have the fear of time running out. You never see a bear or dear checking the time. That is why they have no fear of dying and we do.
__label__0 Are you a serious adult w a need to time something? Mmm, time is &quot;of the essence&quot;? Keep looking. This app producer isn't serious.I need to time medical treatments NOW not in 2 min after this app has flipped me off w it can't run w/o being conne

__label__1 Never. This app is fantastic. It is my daily wakeup alarm clock. I also use it to time naps so I don't over sleep. Just brilliant. It really needs to be one of the initial apps that come installed on new kindles.
__label__0 Kept crashing out during timing. Meant we could not trust it to do the actions we needed it for.Un installed wont use again sorry not good .Was on kindle device
__label__1 The best multiple alarm app I've tried - and I've tried a lot! I use this for a lot of my games. I know when my Farm story crops are ready, I know when I can mine again in Parallel Kingdom. I like how I can give each alarm an image, which pops up when th
__label__1 I've installed this on both my Kindle and my smart phone, primarily as a reminder to get up and move every 30 minutes.  It's so easy to get absorbed and let time - spent sitting - fly by.  I prefer it to the built-in clock on my phone because it's so eas

__label__1 It's so easy to store all important data like, ss card, taxes, bills etc., and then to save them on the cloud to access from any computer.

__label__0 I don't know what  it was supposed to do, but this didn't work for me at all. It took up space on my phone for about two weeks until I deleted it.
__label__1 I am picking up that some g2 users are having troubles getting CamScanner Free to work. That is not the case with me. Maybe the version on Amazon is somehow different than the one on the Market? I am not sure. I will say this: I have used both the free v
__label__1 Works well on my Droid X.  Good for non-glossy paper. I suggest always using the flash (not auto) to get rid of shadows, even in good light.
__label__1 Great app! Got it for free and am glad I did not pass it up! Scans receipts perfectly, which I then send to my docs app.
__label__1 works great! turned a couple of contracts into pdf with phone camera. surprisingly great quality after auto enhancement. thx for a really useful app!
__label__1 I've had this app on my smart phone for quite some time. As a bookkeeper, I find it quite useful. Whenever I need a copy of something and I'm at a meeting, luncheon, or a client's, I can simply make a copy by taking a picture and saving it as a pdf. Then
__label__1 does exactly what it says, quickly and easily. the developer answers almost immediately to email questions/requests, and after last update I see that the interface/looks has been polished a lot.  Great work!
__label__1 I love this app! I use it all the time. It comes in handy for work items and just about anything. I love snapping a shot of recipes and turning them into pdf format. Print them out and slide in my recipe folder. This is probably the best app I've got on 
__label__0 I did not like it.  Hard to use. The tutorial was not helpful. I need something that is a little easier to use.
__label__1 It's amazing how useful this thing is... I use it even for business. Scan a signed contract,  a document on the fly... It's great!
__label__1 This is a must have app, works fantastic!  Convert your paper docs to pdf with very good quality!  Who needs a scanner when you have this app!
__label__1 It's decent how it amplifies the colors and how it turns them into a pdf right away. Good app, thank you!
__label__1 this is a great useful app! you should down load this now! I'm going to give the paid app a try too
__label__1 When I first purchased the app, it would not open on my Kindle, so I wrote a bad review about it and gave it one star. This issue seems to have been temporary or possibly even caused by user error (oops). This app is great!
__label__1 WOW, I can not believe how much I have forgotten about 1+1.  This app is very in-depth and most informative.  Very nice job and easy to follow if you can remember such big words.  Just kidding, not for beginners but great refreshers coarse.
__label__1 This is a great reference for mathematical equations.  Well thought out and each equation's elements are explained using easy to understand language.  Good job designers....deserves 8 stars if not 10.
__label__0 after installing this, i noticed that my battery life is shorter than before. it must be due to the constant killing, and androids restarting, of idle apps.
__label__0 Android manages memory on its own. I was amazed how much more battery life I got when I stopped using them.
__label__0 Please don't think a task killer is going to help you.  It will do more harm than good when it comes to managing your phone.
__label__0 Task killers... they are not recommended on Android.  The OS does a great job of managing memory, don't screw it up by using this product.Trying to save battery? Task killers actually use more battery since the OS reatarts killed tasks over and over and 
__label__0 If you understand how Android works, then you know this app isnt needed. get Watchdog instead so you can actually find out what apps are acting up.
__label__0 dont buy it, and even if it's free don't download it. you shouldnt reward a company who lies in their advertisements and makes Android run worse on majy phones.
__label__0 These apps only harm to your phone. They drain battery life, force resets, and slow your phone down. Android is very good at handling memory by itself without the aid of a task killer. Im a Motorola employee thats tested these apps...and they do much mor
__label__1 I found this to be useful for more than real killing.  It has an app2sd feature, an  uninstaller built in.  also gives the ability to batch move/uninstall.  Now I am aware that the phone can do all this already, however this app puts everything in a good
__label__0 I've used Advanced Task Killer since I got my phone, and this app was significantly less user friendly, had hidden several apps ATK showed me were active so I was unable to kill them, and generally didn't seem to support any of the advanced features it c
__label__0 i really wanted to like the app and would've loved it had all advertized features actually worked. But not only none of the feautures worked (battery life didnt improve, phone did not get faster, non-sys and non-blacklisted apps werent getting killed)  e
__label__0 Had to hard reset my phone (Samsung Fascinate) after installing this app...lost ask my user data...it &quot;killed&quot; my phone, contacts and messaging buttons (so they weren't available anymore) and completely removed some widgets from my phone (pando
__label__1 this app is not needed on 2.1 or higher but it does what the description says. I hate people that kill the app rating without even using the app.
__label__0 Task killers are not needed and can cause more battery use and even harm to your phone on all newer (like in the past year or so) android phones.
__label__1 Some of you amaze me. yes, android doesn't need a task killer with the most recent releases of the OS. But having a task killer for unresponsive apps is a must in my opinion. It certainly beats rebooting the phone when an app acts funny and hangs.
__label__1 and it needs ones that keep things killed. therre is no reason slacker and double twist should be running in the background when i havent used them in months.
__label__0 there is A separate list on the web somewhere that list a lot if these programs as not being good.
__label__1 This is the best app so far on Amazon app of the day. I love this app I think that is the best one ever it is so helpful to me and I use it every day .
__label__0 this app will thrive even though there are people who claim it isnt needed or it is bad for your phone.  the people downloading it will keep it alive and kicking well on into the 22nd century.  android will become a househild name, literally it will be i
__label__1 I love this app for a few reason. Namely it does the job of 3 apps. First, it Kills tasks only when I tell it to. Second, it moves apps to my SD card. Third, it is an uninstaller when I want to get ride of a few apps at a time. Great app. Must have.
__label__0 it is not good to run a task killer on your android phone.use the built in task killer if you really need one.
__label__0 Have to rate down as I finally saw a review saying not to rate down for disagreeing it's useful. Offering this application probably messed up somebody's phone that doesn't understand the issue. Way to go developer, and Amazon for making it free!  Negativ
__label__1 great app, saves me a lot of battery life so more batt for me to enjoy more my phone , 20 words 20 words 20 words yay
__label__0 I don't bother reviewing an app unless it is really good or bad.  This is a bad one.  It is too confusing, has grammar errors and parts like move to SD don't work.  Instead of normal &quot;ignore&quot; lists like most task killers use, this one calls the
__label__1 The majority will say you don't need a task killer post 2.1, while others will swear by it. Giving this app a bad review based on that alone isn't fair.That said, if you're someone that does swear by a task killer, this is a nice one. Everything is there
__label__0 Android manages applications. You do not need app killers. Read ANY Android developer blog or post, and they all say they aren't needed. In fact, they can kill needed and required apps. DO NOT download!
__label__0 Android devices run efficiently without having a taskkiller.  You can check yourself to see the culprits that may be eating up your battery. If it is an app you don't need then uninstall it.  You be the judge. This app will bod down your phone Ans cause 
__label__0 Thought I'd try this out on &quot;free day&quot;. Bad decision. Bogged my phone down, confused everything so that the icons disappeared out of my apps list &amp; the home screen...and accomplished NOTHING of value. Tried to move apps to my sd card that a
__label__1 Apps restart because you have background data on lol everyone claiming they are geniuses because they read an article, disable background data and hell I even disable mobile network when I'm not using internet, my phone will last all day except when I pl
__label__1 I have been using this app for the last month and I must sat it works pretty good it has done a great job of extending my battery life.  I have tried a couple of free apps out there but this one seams to work the best so far
__label__0 Task killers are worse than useless with Android 2 and later. Killing running processes can mess up your phone. Killing idle processes really has no effect on performance. Automatic task killers will always add some load to your CPU, so this really hurts
__label__0 Task Killers don't kill task self-booters for long.  I found a solution...Game Booster by Infolife LLC on the app store.  Install any and all apps you want to run smoothly, even the stock browser, into Game Booster's list.  Run Game Booster and it cleans
__label__1 This applies works great!  So what if you don't need it, don't degrade it.  Get a life people and quit ruining my life.
__label__1 Is your smartphone getting stupider?  Maybe it is just overloaded with stuff you did not even know is running.  Do you both the shut down and restart at least once a day?  I do, but I still use this as soon as the machine starts to drag its feet.
__label__0 i got it for free and until I learned what it was really doing (eating my battery) i used it.  i also uninstalled it.  Samsung Charge
__label__1 to all the idiots giving the app One star just because they don't think a phone needs a task killer, you guys are idiots. Don't ruin an app's rating because you don't think Amazon should've made it the free app of the day.As to the app itself, runs fairl
__label__0 Android does not let handling of applications to 3d party apps since 2.2 So this is a waste of time, bandwidth etc.
__label__0 The average user fundamentally misunderstands how android and linux works if they think a task killer is beneficial. If you don't believe me, search google.
__label__0 Some reviewers don't understand. this is not jist &quot;another way&quot; to kill apps or manage memory. it is a BAD way to do it. use this and you eat more power! no task kikking is needed, except for rogue apps.for rogue apps, there IS a good free tool
__label__1 I got this app when it was free and if you set it up properly it works wonders. I&apos;m running froyo 2.2 on HTC Thunderbolt and this app works like a charm. everyone is quoting the same lame article on some Google site but that article is full of crap.
__label__0 You don't need a task killer, Android does that for you. I tried this out, and it seems like it wastes even more battery that it savess.
__label__0 installed wen free and it could kill tasks one day later got notification from it that my system was too slow and sent me to another app to download. one star seems a lot for spam
__label__1 this app works as designed. people a review is for how the product works not how you personally feel if it is needed or not. with that mentality all games should be one star because you don't need them,they take up space and waste your battery.this actua
__label__0 I would like to thank Amazon &amp; all previous reviewers that brought out the questionable need for taskkillers because of this freebee. After much reading I have NOT taken this app and uninstalled the free task killer I had been using. My phone is runn
__label__0 Big thumbs down to Amazon for making this the free app of the day. If you are running Android 2.1 or greater (and you probably are) then task killers are completely pointless. Background apps don't use battery life! If you really want to save on battery 
__label__0 If you have an Android phone, you do not need a task killer.  That's the simplest way to express this fact to those who get suckered into getting one. If you want to know why,  google it and browse some Android forums,  you'll be better for it.
__label__0 This app doesnt even deserve a star, since it keeps FCing on boot, and I had to restore from a system backup to stop this! D2G Fission 2.4.3
__label__1 Regardless of what you think about task killers, this one dooes what it says it will do. Just because a person doesn't like task killers does not mean that the app is poorly designed.The developers clearly made a good task killer, for those that use them
__label__0 Pointless app. Charging money for something Android does on its own is a crime. Negative stars if I was allowed.
__label__0 Unlike most of the negative reviews, I'm not going to bash this app for the sake of bashing it, I actually downloaded it and tried it.  This is a terrible app and all the claims the developer makes is a steaming pile of you know what.  I won't get into t
__label__1 The app is fine. But it is being down voted by morons who never used it. Amazon should filter reviews.
__label__1 do you people know what an app review is? Only review the app! app does its job, stop arguing on the grounds that it's necessary or not!
__label__0 If you familiar with th OS you will recognize there is no need for a task killer. Shame on Amazon for putting this garbae as the free app.
__label__0 I'm well aware that it has been said a hundred times already, but task killers are just an easy way for developers to make money off of the uninformed.  Most apps &quot;running in the background&quot; are just paused and are not actually running. If an a
__label__0 While there is obviously some debate about whether task killers should be used, I can say that this one is horrible.  The second I installed it my G2 the phone slowed to a crawl.  It took about 10 minutes to slowly be able to uninstall the app, at which 
__label__0 This would be a good app if Amazon updated it. If they would just update the application I think we would have a great app.
__label__0 App not necessary for optimal device performance. Another unnecessary app to take up space. Task killers are lame sauce, man.
__label__1 it must be you pushing down on the power button it works great on my kindle fire try the app worth your time
__label__0 this game is just bad, it crashes, and the whole premise is stupid. don't get it. really don't get it.
__label__1 I actually love this game, have not had but one issue when it forced close. I play this game almost everyday when I have a little down time. The birds are cute and while it may not seem like it there is actually a little difficulty, especially in puzzle 
__label__1 Didn't have any problems with this on my ATRIX 2 except I couldn't stop playing it--and the birds are so cute
__label__1 I'm loving this game! I've been playing it all day. I am on a Droid X and have had no issues at all. Thank you!
__label__0 Kept slowing down, then started locking up. Last time I played it my kindel fire froze up.Cute game ,but not worth having my fire lock up.
__label__0 cute and fun at first but wtf is up with the sudden black screen? after hrs of the screen going black it went back to normal. but then I realized how boring this game was so I uninstalled it. I'm just glad that I bought this free instead of the original 
__label__1 After a few mins. of play on the kindle fire, it reverted to a black screen of death with the now inappropriately perky music still going.  On the Kindle Fire, aspirin  so many found, it became unresponsive to controls.  A shame. Update:  Seems to work f
__label__1 I'm sorry for the people who couldn't enjoy this game.its fun, yet addicting!I had no trouble on a HTC incredible 2.great game.kudos to the developer.
__label__1 It works just fine on my tablet(Acer-iconia). But I agree it seems impossible to beat in casual play. Just fix that and it will be great.
__label__0 I download apps all the time and this is the first one that is forcing a review simply because it works so poorly. Within the first two minutes of playing on my Kindle Fire, the entire screen went black, I was able to recover it, 30 seconds later it happ
__label__1 just make an update that will give the option to move to SD card. i read that i am not the only one to request that either. thank you.
__label__0 the game black screened on me oer and over so I am deleting this from kindle , but when I was playong it I did like it
__label__0 Cute game. Thought my grandkids would love it. Of course, I had to play it first, right? Not 3 or 4 minutes into the game, that black screen so many have mentioned appeared. I uninstalled it from my Kindle Fire less than 5 minutes after installing. Oh we
__label__0 This app didn't work on my Motorola Xoom tablet. Press to start it said, tap did nothing. Makes it useless to me.
__label__0 Started playing, went to black screen within 5 moves, removing this from my apps even thou it was free.  This freeze could just need a fix but it wasn't that cute to retry the install
__label__1 After downloading this app to my Kindle Fire, my grandkids would anxtiously run to my side just to be albe to watch me play. My oldest grandson enjoys pointing out various moves I can make. He also likes playing it on Grandma's Kindle. Did I mention that
__label__1 This is the cutest app!!! I tried the free app and it would freeze right after I completed the first level. I enjoyed playing so I went ahead and spent the buck 28, well worth it. I have a Kindle fire and it works PERFECTLY. Highly recommend!!!  got to g
__label__0 Got this app as the FAOTD a few weeks ago and really like it, works fine on rooted Nook tablet.  Noticed today that there was an update, prior to downloading, reviewed the app info and found the developers have added in permission to view thumb nails of 
__label__0 Come on if you are going to offer an app, at the very least you can do is make sure it works.  It will not even install in my Kindle Fire.
__label__0 like a lot of the other reviews say, I was able to play for about 5 min. then the screen went black, there was still sound. I tried clicking out of it then going back in but it was still black. I gave it a chance but its not even worth downloading!!!!
__label__0 was enjoying game till a black screen interrupted it. cannot get far.......would really enjoy this game if I could play longer!! please fix!!
__label__0 Worked fine for about 3 minutes, then an ominous black screen appeared and I could no longer play, even after an app restart, but I could still hear the music. Um, wtf?
__label__1 This game is a lot of fun and is easy to learn but the levels offer fun challenges. Works wonderfully on the kindle fire, have never had any issue with it crashing.
__label__1 Great relaxing fun, and oh so cute. I wish I had told my wife to download it when it was free. She keeps stealing my phone.I really like the relaxation mode. Just play without worries.I highly recommend it.
__label__1 Too many many Amazon users are terrible review writers. They claim the screen goes black and neglect to mention they all have one of a hangfull of the same devices. It works great on my Droid 2. It's a very fun game that you can pick up and play with a &
__label__0 I have this on my phone (Motorola Bravo) and it works there.  But on Kindle Fire, there appears to be no way to exit the app ... ?I tried shutting device down for an hour but it still came right back up.  I finally escaped by clicking a link in the progr
__label__0 Yet another free app downloaded and deleted within 5 minutes. They couldn't come up with an original name; you can guess how good the game is... 1 star for a bald face attempt to get some sales by using a similar name to that other bird game.
__label__0 I liv the idea and graphics but it blacks out after 3 minutes and u have to unistall then reinstall it. ut it still blacks out so u only get it for 4 minutes...or atleast it does on my kindlefire
__label__1 Works great on my Kindle Fire.  Fun game! reminds me a lot of Chuzzle. I will be recommending this to others.
__label__0 I am experiencing the same problem everyone else seems to be on the kindle...literally works for no more than 3 minutes and it won't work after that. Even tried reinstalling but same thing all over again.
__label__1 really cute game, doesn't crash at all or freeze it works fine on my kindle fire. and plus it tells you it says that the game might not work on all tablets.
__label__1 HULK STRONGEST ONE THERE IS! Me like little fluffy birds...but hulk like them too much...they no more fluffy in my hand. They dead!As for SUPERMAN75...Me and superman had a fightI hit him in the head with Kryptonite...He lost his brain...Went insane..Now
__label__1 Works perfectly on nexus s. Simple and fun game play. Graphic and sound are well done.My 3 year old manage to play it ok.
__label__0 A boring, lame app.  The app-makers must have thought that (adjective) + &#34;Birds&#34; + app = profit.  They forgot the part where the app should actually be a good game.  This is lame.  I've already deleted it from my device.
__label__0 every day i wait for the new free ap of the day and and u can just gess how i felt when the game froze on me for no reason at all i know that it was free to me but it would usaly have been for money so this was vary disappointed to me
__label__0 stops working on my fire after a few minutes. cute game, but needs a fix for kindle. an update would be nice.
__label__1 I got hooked on this game on my daughter-in-laws Kindle, so when I got my Kindle I ordered it for me.
__label__0 After updating new permissions will allow application to see what processes are running and change your wifi settings. I am uninstalling.
__label__1 I LOVE this game. Earlier versions crashed frequently but the problems seem to have been resolved with the current release.  I've been playing it for about a week since the last update without a problem.
__label__0 Do not get this app!! It crashes on my Kindle Fire and it gives me a black screen.But besides that its a cute game for kids and their parents to play with.
__label__1 Awesome game for the Kindle Fire!  The game play is very addictive and the birds are adorable.  The graphics are well worth the $$$.
__label__1 Great game-had a little trouble with the game sticking but for the most part it works great! Bring on more great games like this!
__label__1 Best game for passing time.  If you like bejeweled, you are going to love this game. I had no problems with it.  2 Thumbs up!
__label__1 This is a typical match three game. The graphics are super cute and rendered nicely. It downloaded quickly on my Fire and I haven't had any in game play issues. Overall it is a wonderful little app.
__label__1 I have no problem on my bionic works great. Ty fluffy birds. I hope to get more things from them. Ye ha!!!
__label__0 that would be my diagnosis for this app if it presented itself to me as a new patient. I would refer them to a specialist, because of the severity of its prognosis. HIGHLY CONTAGIOUS!!!
__label__1 I love this game! I dont see what the issue is about with crashing, this game hasn't crashed on Me once!
__label__1 Sceptical because of all the bad reviews. I gave it a try and played through a few different game modes with no problems. Reminded me a lot like chuzzle which is just such a fun game! I'd recommend it... (htc sensation)
__label__1 Works great, looks to be a kindle fire only issue going by all the reviews.  No problems here and fun to play.
__label__0 Played for about 10 sec and game stopped and went to a black screen! (DROID X) ??? WTH! PLEASE FIX!!!!
__label__1 Timing is everything on this game. It's really simple and yet I keep coming back to it. never had any problems with crashing or freezing
__label__1 Very glad that I downloaded this game in spite of it having more 1 star reviews. It is very easy, free, fun! I'm loving it.
__label__1 To those having troubles with this app on Kindle Fire you might want to check your device settings to assure you aren't maxed out or near max with your app storage. That could cause you to be having troubles where others don't.I like this game because it
__label__1 This one is just a fun game for anyone to play~nice relaxing game; easy to play & understand~kids would love it as adults do too~
__label__0 This was a free app. of the day when, I downloaded it on my Kindlefire. The game itself is very addicting and cute and people as young as 3 or4 could play easy levels. However,Its doesn't work very well. The screen will go black leaving just sound and ti
__label__0 Another kindle fire app that does not work. Big dissapointment!!!  I have downloaded several other apps specifically for the fire only to have them flop. Who is at fault,???
__label__1 Fluffy birds is a fun puzzle game that works great on my kindle fire.  It never crashes and is very fun and addictive.  The fluffy birds are cute and funny.  Graphics are great, controls are great, everything is great!  Definitely one of my favorite apps
__label__0 Glad this app was free. Stopped twice on my 3yo w a black screen. Really sucks cause she was liking the game. I do not recommend.
__label__1 Hours of fun, works great on my KINDLE FIRE! Puzzle like game, with colors and eggs, I recommend giving it a try, I got it for free one week!
__label__1 works very well on inspire 4g. graphics are cute and sound is adjustable. has exit command which should be required on all apps... thanks
__label__0 I didn't even try to play this app.  I downloaded (easy to do) and when I opened it I got the alert from my phone (LG Optimus V) that it could not be moved to the SD card.  I just put in a 32G card for the purpose of games like this (and more photos).  I
__label__0 don't click on a golden egg because if you do the screen will go black and you will have to go to your home screen to get out. game was cute but impossible to get eggs together in order to move to next level. then crashes. uninstalled from my kindle fire
__label__0 fun game @ first, but touched the golden egg, and......BLACKOUT!!!! give it 0 if could. I did'nt really get it, but just ended up deleting. like, 5 seconds ago. really one word to destine this app. C-H-E-A-P. even for free.don't get this app. really, don
__label__1 This is similiar to the game bejewled, but has a few extra twists to it. I enjoyed it a lot.
__label__1 This is a fun game for all ages!  I have had no problems on my Kindle Fire.  If you have a few minutes to kill this a the game for you!!!
__label__1 there were absolutely no problems I had playing this game on my HTC Droid Incredible 2. its nothing like angry birds other than the fact there are birds. too many people are too stupid to understand that difference.
__label__1 so dont listen to thoose stupid reviews because this game is fun and relaxing when tjere is no timer always seems to calm me down soothe me and put me yo sleep no its np scary its really fun and cool i loqve it you should get it
__label__1 I love this game. Yes it is just like Chuzzle, but I love that game too. I like the 3 different game modes. Works fine on my phone.
__label__1 ok so I especially luv the huge bird becauese it just floats away so funny! I would so get it if I were you.
__label__0 Downloaded this app and played one game and screen went black.  I couldn't get it to work.  Waste of time and space on my kindle. At least it was free and. worth. a try.  Needless to say, I deleted it immediately.
__label__1 Fluffy is nothing more than a chuzzle knock off, but if you're gonna copy someone do it like this! As a FAOTD its perfect!!
__label__1 Haven't quite got the hang of it yet and it starts acting up. Maybe I will try again after an update or uninstall altogether.
__label__1 I love this game. It works quite well on my kindle fire.... this is not your average match three game. The creators really did something cute with this one. Highly recommended!!
__label__0 so I can't really complain. It does not work on the XOOM. The game will open it just won't do anything after that. good luck
__label__1 Sorry to read that many are having trouble w/this game.  Don't let negative reviews stop you from giving it a try. I have an inexpensive Nextbook Android and this game runs perfectly.  Been playing it for several hours...no glitches at all.So give it a t
__label__0 This app will not launch past the start up screen on my Xoom tablet. I can't play this game at all.
__label__1 game is pretty good, i did not experienced any technical problems. Also I like ability to play casual and puzzle modes.
__label__0 keeps freezing up.  also, very slow to respond.  not worth it.  glad i did not pay anything for it.  i will delete it.
__label__1 My smart phone has a glitch. It is most frustrating and inconvient. While the icon on the phone does not work, I did set up a YouMail Visual Voicemail account online and am easily able to access it from the phone. I now get my voice mail messages which i
__label__1 It is a great app. No problems so far, ppl think its cool when it calls them by name! Htc evo
__label__0 I got this app because it said you could use it in place of your providers voice mail, however my provider does not offer any voice mail and it is not common here overseas where I am. I wanted it to basically give me the feature but it is not compatible 
__label__1 have used this app for over 2 yrs and 2 phones. like all the settings and the personal greeting , great replacement for cell vm. I have had very few issues in the 2 yrs. sometimes slow delivery depends on location.  set up on both phone and website work 
__label__1 Love this app so much.  Like the fact that it emails you the message link and tells you who it was calling even if they aren't stored in your phone
__label__1 The only voice mail program that knows who's calling! &quot;Hello John, Sarah can't come to the phone right now. Please leave a message.&quot; its also very fluid in it's programming and extremely user friendly. Had this on three different Blackberries a
__label__0 I downloaded this as a free alternative to the visual voicemail that came on my phone. It eventually stopped generating the text version of my voicemails. None of the uninstall procedures on the website worked, so now I must call my provider to fix my vo
__label__1 I would recommend this app for the sheer pleasure of finding out who said what, after reading some of the quotes I was shocked that our politicians plagiarize from everyone from Adolph Hitler to Gandi.I would say BQ has collected some goodies
__label__1 It has funny quotes and serious ones. They were smart and sell picked out . This is the app for you.
__label__1 This is a pretty good app if you like quotes. The quotes are sorted by the author initially, but you can set it up by categories, mark favorites and even set up quotes of the day.
__label__1 Love it.  If you like Sorry u will love this game.  Great sound effects.  I have nothing bad to say about this game.

__label__1 One of the best free apps . One does not expect a boardgame to be so much fun.  The airplane theme makes the game work.  Super fun.!
__label__1 Reminds me of the old marble board game Aggravation.  Fun and easy to learn, cute airplane playing pieces. Looks good on my Kindle Fire.
__label__1 for anyone who remembers the classic board game 'aggravation' this is essentially it!! its simple and fun for all ages in my opinion. its really nice to play and everyone should give it a try! :-)
__label__1 This game will keep you coming back over and over. It is so much fun. I can not get enough of this game. The graphics are awesome.
__label__1 I love playing regular ludo nonlinear. this is my new favorite game on my kindle. my kids even true to get my kindle so they can play it
__label__1 If you like the board game SORRY then you will like this game.. its a cute little twist with the airplanes (sounds included..lol)  I played it 5 times so far and I really liked it so its worth the FREE download to check it out. :)
__label__1 it is a great time killer. has never frozen up. i would recommend it. hope you enjoy it as much as i have.
__label__1 great game with lots of different options for difficulty and game play. the sounds are lots of fun too. hi
__label__1 I like that this game can be played with other. My Daughter and I have fun playing togeather. It does remind me of parchisi but i like the colored squares that allow your peice to move faster.
__label__1 Pinball Deluxe free and I liked it so well I purchased Pinball deluxe premium It a great set of pinball games.
__label__1 this app rocks it got its graphics updated and they're  almost too good so its worth your money... get this app
__label__0 Looks great but crashes at start up on my Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 with 4.4.2 update. Small popups at bottom of screen looks like a request to log into social media.Really wish it would work! Fortunately I got it 6/27/14 as part of the 30 free paid app 'sal
__label__1 this app is great! And the best part is that the other version is free! But to be honest the premium is like $2.00. but that the only stupid part. But other than that this is an awesome app !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
__label__1 Tho game is by far the best pinball game I own. It was especially good on a road trip I took. This game is also a great bourdom buster!!
__label__1 I first downloaded the free version on to my Toshiba Thrive. Selecting stretch to fill the screen instead of zoom gave great results. The ads were unobtrusive. It only took about an hour of game play to know that seeing a couple more tables was worth the
__label__1 Picked this up while it was on sale for a buck - have only played two of the tables:"Wild West", which looks fantastic and plays just like the real deal, and "Brix", which is like a pinball-style variation on a "Breakout" video game.Both of these games a
__label__1 This is fun with a capital &#34;F&#34; !!! So easy to play and works just like a real pin ball machine. Different games within keeps it fresh and non boring. This is a game I will enjoy for a long time. GREAT for kids as well. I highly recommend this app
__label__1 Wasn't too hopeful when I downloaded, I had downloaded and deleted Pinball games in the past. But this one is a fooler. I am so hooked on it I can't stop playing it! There are several choices to make and they are all fun, and it keeps track of your score
__label__1 Works great on my Galaxy Note 10.1 tablet with 4.4.2, but crashes on my Galaxy Note 2 phone with 4.4.2. Update 06/29/2014 - They just came out with a new update and it works great on my phone now!
__label__1 I first got this app (the free one) for my Kindle Fire. I didn't like it because two of the &#34;tables&#34; can't be fully seen until the ball comes below the half-way point. With my 10&#34; tablet, this is great. Very entertaining with good graphics an
__label__1 Pinball Deluxe Premium is a first rate pinball game that plays very well on my Kindle Fire. There are five tables:1. Brix2. Wild West3. Carnival4. Space Frontier5. Diving for Treasure (a big table, bigger than the screen, but it autoscrolls with the ball
__label__1 Looks real and the tables look genuine. Fun to pass the time with this game.
__label__1 Great graphics. Needed a Pinball game for my new Kindle and this one is fantastic. A lot of challenging games.
__label__1 I can't believe this app was free for 2 days.  It's freakin' great!  You really get the arcade experience.  It is dangerously fun.  I have a no-brand 7&#34; Android tablet with the Amazon App Store and this app is working like a charm for me.  So much ti
__label__1 I've been a pinball fan for years. I was really sad when my 4 MASSIVE pinball games became unplayable on my newer operating systems. The ball physics are quite good and the tables not overly complex, since I AM playing on a small screen. I got the free a
__label__1 Great product I thought that it played some like the real thing. I like the different layouts and the different levels on the board to play makes it a lot more fun.
__label__1 I enjoy playing the game to relax.
__label__1 From nightwhisper.com, this has great graphics even good sounds,  Make sure you upgrade to get out from the ads, its worth it.
__label__1 GREAT and interesting game! Fun to play! Was thinking that I'd just play for a few minutes, but three hours later I was jsut saying to myself...OK I"m quitting after one more game! Truly addicting and fun! Lots of options to play, I like the Wild West!
__label__1 one word...pinballthis is great!!! I love it!!!!! this is my new favorite game!!!!!  everybody should get this game!!!.get it now
__label__0 I love the free version but.need to find out why this version shows.up so.small on.my kindle fire dxI will have to call May day and see why
__label__1 Five very different games to enjoy, motion is very realistic, sounds are just like the old pinball games of my younger days.  Very enjoyable. The western one is the hardest one for me, though.  Still can't get past &#34;you show promise&#34;.  Your score
__label__0 Severely lags making the game unplayable. I have used the free version on ICS, and it was pretty fun. I haven't tried this version on any of my other devices, but at this point I will just uninstall and wait for an update.
__label__1 This game best mirrors an actual pinball table.  I play it constantly.  I would recommend to anyone as their top pinball game.
__label__1 This Pinball Deluxe has three of the great games for you to play pinball. &#34;Word of warning&#34;.&#34;watch put for the bumper & tilting.
__label__1 I love pinball and this provides a nice way to pass the time if you like pinball as well.  If you are unsure of whether you want to actually pay money for the premium version, you might want to first download Pinball Deluxe Free.  Give it a spin, and if 
__label__1 I don't play much but I like. It is different form the one on my phone so I had to get use to it. I enjoy when I do play but mostly I read more now!
__label__1 This is a great solitaire game. I love having it on my Kindle Fire. So easy & so entertaining and so easy to play..
__label__0 cards too small, not as workable or customisable as I like. it is OK for a quick game, but I like playing for longer periods of time
__label__1 This type of solitaire is what I like best and I found it at Amazon.I can take it with me anywhere. I have it on my Kindle Fire HD.I would recommend it to anyone who likes solitaire.
__label__1 I enjoy playing solitaire and have for many years. It is convenient to play on the computer. My sight is not as good as it used to be so being able to see the cards on the computer is a plus.
__label__1 this game is a true classic.  you get into it and can get totally lost.  time slips away and you get so involved into it. love it.
__label__1 I like this great game.  Please try this great game.  I really enjoy this great game.  great game.  try this.
__label__1 Plain old sol.  This is an easy to use game that even gives hints when you are stumped and ready to quit.  It will deal hands that can be beat or random deals.  For the price it can't be beat.
__label__0 Its boring and confusing! If I could rate this app NO stars I would. Why don't they offer no stars?I DO NOT recommend this app/game at all.Don't get it!When or if you get this game and hate it ....... don't complain because I warned you!!!
__label__0 Head to head racing!  Whoohoo!  Oh, wait, you mean that I'm not actually racing someone live, it's just a recording of someone's previous race I'm racing against?  Uhm, not so "head to head" in my opinion.  Can't even run them off the road...  The graphi
__label__1 I will agree to bad graphics. but, I like it that way. its a simple game and super addicting. controls can take a while to master but its so much fun once u get them down. and its cool that u can race ur friends. overall, this game rocks. and its free!!
__label__0 No good. Do not get this app. Don't even know how it made it in app store. Samsung fascinate. Delete and never come back. :)
__label__0 they say that it is free and you play maybe two or so levels and then you can't play anymore unless you buy the whole game so really not worth taking your time to dowload on anything unless you want to actually buy the game after a few mintues of playing
__label__1 Loved this game!!!!  All strategy games are fun but thought this one was really fun and kept me entertained for quite a while.
__label__1 if you guys are complaining I think you are crazy. Mine worked fine like the one on the computer. There is no difference. It may not have worked for you people but it worked fine for me. YOU WILL NEVR MAKE ME COMPLAIN!
__label__0 This game is way to hard and it is boring after awhile of playing it, so I don't have it on my Kindle fire
__label__0 This farm game is very mediocre. Actually it sucks. The better farm game is Papaya Farm and its free to have the full version. Download it to your Android or iPhone and use referral code Steam007 to get 300 papayas plus some bonuses.
__label__0 The game only let me play one level before it shut down. I was considering buying the full version if Iiked the free version, but I'm staying away from this!
__label__0 This company lied. They said that it has a unlimited play time, but actually, after 3 levels, the company prompts you to either buy the full version or delete it.And I deleted this game.
__label__0 it says unlimited game play, but they lied. after 3 level, pop up says buy it or close it. they lied. I'm never buying anything from this company for lying.
__label__0 I downloaded this as my mom seems to have a  lot of fun playing on her I pad,but after I downloaded this game, it said it would not play on my kindle to delete it.
__label__0 This app looked like fun, but I never got to play it... I installed it and it just keeps force closing on me. I tried thee times in a row and just got the force close box.
__label__0 i was wondering why such nice app has too low ratings - now i know it simply does not work! on my tab 2 i cannot start it.
__label__0 I wish I had read the reviews before buying. First bad app I've bought.  Don't waste your money.  What else can I say?
__label__1 Maybe my luck has been better. The app works great. Facial recognition works fine and end result is hilarious. Very realistic too.
__label__0 pleese don get on kindeel.it has no camera. andi had to hag. y mummy pay for a freaking app!! don't getter this on kindel it has no camera. any other device wit camera should b heterodox.
__label__1 How do you make  payments on Amazon so you can get new games.when I try it won't let me because of my payments. And my kids Really want fat kiosk
__label__0 The built in camera app is DOA.  if you can get a photo to actually take, it squeezes everything together. It's best to use a stock photo or use your normal camera.Overall, this app is broken; nearly beyond repair.  The maker of this needs to go back and
__label__0 I am not usually so stupid, but for some reason, I cannot get this to even show up on my kindle fire. I download it, it Amazon says it's on my device, but it's definitely not. I have tried 20 different things to get it functioning and just don't seem to 
__label__0 It will stuck on buffering then network error. Please fix this as soon as possible. Trio Stealth Lite 4.3 Thanks
__label__0 I have the ustream app on my phone and it works fine, but on my kindle fire hd it doesnt work at allIve uninstalled and reinstalled several times and still no luck.  I am very disappointed.
__label__1 Ustream is a must have for the hardcore gamer, etc, I love it for watching Gamespot live, etc. All that I have watched so far is clean, clear, and loads up perfectly!. The people who complain must simply have to slow of wi-fi's, or are not watching it on
__label__0 the ustream app did not work on my kindle fire. needs more development if it to be offered on that platform.
__label__0 Every page you open on Ustream, it says buffering and nothing happens at all, it doesn't load at all! Very disappointed.
__label__0 I have no idea what thie app is meant to do, but I can't make it do anything. So far it is totally useless.
__label__1 I have friends that stream their horses births on ustream so having it my phone is great then I don't miss the births even when I am out of town they call and let me know its happening and I get to join them even on the road :)
__label__0 I can't even remember why i downloaded this product.  Please don't waste your precious time,  you will not be happy
__label__1 I am a nurse and have a bedbound resident who watches the Decorah eagles on it. Just seeing the look on his face -I give it a 10!!! Color is clear on my kindle fire. gives me quick access.
__label__0 Perhaps I am udinge the wrong Kindle for this App, I am not interested in what is offered lit do not perform what I thought it would do.
__label__1 Works just great on my Kindle Fire HD. Very clear picture (though small) and sound is great with no buffering so far. If it into ustream then I would get this for your HD.
__label__0 I downloaded this app to watch FIRST Robotics Regionals which use Ustream to webcast their live feeds, but once I had the app installed, I could not locate a single stream.
__label__1 I love to watch things live and Ustream gives it to you plus there are so many different things you can watch on it . I never get board I have it on a couple of my tablets.
__label__0 I downloaded this app to watch our live stream church service. It only worked once. It would error and force close. Nothing changed after I deleted and re-installed. It would crash if I selected the favorites button and would not stream anything but an e
__label__1 I have a android tablet with a root that allows this to be compatible. The stream quality has been great & so has the recorded vid quality. The interface is very simple & easy to navigate. Very satisfied.
__label__1 loaded this to my kindle, nice to be able to listen to some shows that way, great app and it is free
__label__1 Does exactly what it would do on a laptop but now I could use it on my phone.  Easy to navigate.
__label__1 U- Stream app works great. It allows streaming content on U-Stream on a Kindle Fire that was unable to watch by just going to the U-Stream website. (Kindle users store this app on your cloud storage so as to not use up your internal memory.)
__label__1 I needed this on my Kindle to watch certain cams like hummingbird cams, polar bear cams etc. Works like a charm with a clear picture
__label__1 I love the rdio service and this app does a great job of letting me access the content. The streaming works well and the offline listening is great.
__label__1 Web, mobile and tablet all work great with radio -- feels less bloated that Spotify as an experience and is great with its offline mode.  Feels like I have my music collection in the cloud.
__label__1 Just so we're clear, Rdio is paid subscription service for streaming music. It's comparable to Spotify, though I feel like Rdio has a better selection of songs. I switched from Spotify to Rdio and haven't looked back. The app works well and is organized 
__label__0 did not like how this website was disorganize because it was difficult to find the songs.  Then the free songs they diplayed were terrible.
__label__1 Music more music Rdio has great selection and customization. Only if they could get some ACDC and METALLICA that would be AWESOMENESS..
__label__0 I don't really get the point of this.  All the music seems to be what they want to offer as apposed to finding music I like.  They also bomb your inbox with useless mail.
__label__1 If your a college student rdio is the must have music subscription app. As of now, premium has a special going on where college students only pay 4.99 month for up to four years while in school. That half the price of spotify, rhapsody, and Google all ac
__label__1 Any song... No cost... Full song.... No Internet required... I got my free app worth millions of dollars.... U should get it and fast downloading..
__label__1 Found this after MOG announced it would be closing down.  I like Rdio better than MOG now in that it is easier to move around in than MOG.
__label__1 im a twelve year old elton john freak. i wanted some songs but i didnt have any money in my amazon account. so i googled where to get free music and found rdio. i found the app for it and its really good. i love it. i can listen to elton john internet or
__label__0 I REALY WANTED THIS APP,  BUT I WAS UNABLE TO SIGN. IN. I DID EVERYTHING  THEY SAID TO DO,  BUT NO LUCK
__label__1 stream any album any timechoose any artist using the search feature just about all the albums will be listedthis is a great site or app to listen to a complete album of your favorite artistI have it on my ROKU devices & Apple products..
__label__1 Rdio is a nice/ hot app to have on your kinlde fire. It let you listen to the newest cd without buying them.
__label__1 As the title says. Its amazing. Found all album covers for my music. I like it a lot :) I'm happy I got it.
__label__0 seriously this is app is not free, not working, and definitely not cooperative i tried putting in my password to sign up and it just stopped working it was really unbelievable so please don'twaste your money on a &quot;free&quot; app
__label__1 I WAS ABLE TO LISTEN TO ARTISTS  THAT I THOUGHT I WOULD NEVER HEAR AGAIN.YOU CAN HEAR SONGS FROM THE PAST THAT YOU THOUGHT WERE GONE FOREVER.I AM AMAZED AT WHAT IS AVAILABLE.
__label__0 This app sends 5 or more emails a day and won't let you unsubscribe.  It says you may unsubscribe from the emails. Hope you have more success than I did.
__label__0 The app itself works great.  I got the two week free trial on my Kindle Fire and was very pleased with it.  But I was disappointed to find out that it was $10 A MONTH to use it on a tablet or mobile device after the two weeks were up.  That's $120 a year
__label__1 I love this app. I am still exploring all the possibilities. But what I have had time to listen to I have really enjoyed
__label__1 I really love the way you can get whole albums of the singers and play that, as well as the &#34;like&#34; feature.  Since I've found this I've had it on my computer playing constantly :)  (and on my phone, and on my Kindle)
__label__0 I run into this because "SoundHound" had an option for "Listen to on Rdio".  I learned that is just an ad with no integration.  The link opens the Appstore regardless if Rdio is installed or not.  Although that is most likely an issue with SoundHound but
__label__1 I listen to majority country music, so when I saw this I knew I had to download it. I was pleasantly surprised! I love it! :) better then iHeartRadio and Pandora :)
__label__1 It is a free APP and you get great music. You can get old country as well as modern as well as bluegrass and gospel.
__label__0 It wasn't really hooked up to the radio that then one must pay for.  Not something I want to pay for.Very disappointing!
__label__0 I am a country music fan and this app does nothing for Country music!  It is not worth the trouble installing it.
__label__1 1 of the best apps ever I love county music and I love this app if you like or love county u will love this app!!!!!!!!!! I would recommend it for anyone who likes county music!!!
__label__1 its so easy to use it makes it fun plus its free double greatness. whoop I'm a country loving teen Yahoo whoo this is amazing
__label__1 I love country music and this app provides a great way to listen to just one type of music.  It is awesome!!!
__label__0 It did not work right. I could not get it to download at first and then when it did then it would not work.
__label__0 i have not had the time to use it so i can not say to much about it
__label__1 I like the country oldies station. So it is nice to find so many stations .I really like this app.Thanks
__label__1 This is GREAT!!! Can hear all the country music i want right off of my Kindle Fire.  Grandkids like it too
__label__1 Love this station! I work with jewelry and this station can get me rocking and crying at the same time while I am putting my pieces together for a show. I love country music radio.
__label__0 This app is very disturbing turns on by It self.have problems navigating it app tells you nothing about operating it .not happy.As soon as I figure out how to delete it with out looking my other apps it's gone..
__label__1 This was one of the first apps I downloaded after getting my Droid. It is so simple to use and is a life saver when I go grocery shopping or run errands.
__label__1 love this ap! this app keeps me organized and my head on straight when I run out to the grocery store and forget my shopping list - this way its always with me and whenever I have something pop into my head I can quick input it into my phone! Its also gr

__label__1 I love this app! It is very helpful! I really like to just play around with the scanner! :) If I were you I would download! You can always uninstall!!!!!! :)
__label__1 Definitely could not do without this app! I use it as my primary shopping list. One thing I'd like to see is being able to categorize food groups/store sections, like fruits, veggies, meat, drinks, bakery, etc. Otherwise excellent and highly recommended,
__label__1 I looked a couple of other apps for shopping lists and this was the best. Love that I can have it on all my devices and sync them.Recommend to all my friends
__label__1 I love this app.  I have the pro version and us it for my shopping trips.  I love that I can share my lists with my husband and we are both kept current.  It keeps a running total if my checkout amount including deductions for any coupons I plan to use. 
__label__1 i LOVE this! i always forget my shopping list at the house..this way, its always with me! the scanner recognized some odd things, which surprised me, but it doesn't recognize my local grocery store brands (not really a problem...i just type the name of t
__label__1 I use this for my  lists every day. No more thinking of items I need and then forgetting it before I can write it down. also has nice to do list.
__label__1 Running on my Samsung Verizon fascinate. This is a super-handy app that can keep track of multiple lists, and maintain my commonly-purchased items.
__label__1 This is one of the best shopping list or list making programs I have ever seen. You can use the camera for barcodes on android and sync it across multiple devices. The lists can even be shared with friends. Great for keeping a household inventory for gro
__label__1 [FIRST REVIEW] I have used this app for a full month and loved it, although to fully reap the rewards, one must painstakingly scan each item and add pricing.  So be it.  But in an unforgivable  update, all of my lists were WIPED OUT!  Seriously!?  From a
__label__1 How did I live before this app? It's way too much fun to go around scanning the stuff in the house.
__label__0 Drains battery with the animation on home screen and can't turn it off unless you upgrade to pro. Can't customize anything till you up grade. Uninstalling.
__label__1 I love this app! I love to organize things and this helps me so much! You can use it for your pantry, but you can also use it for anything. I love it and hotly recommend it for people like me.
__label__1 This app is perfect for my shopping needs. I can add as many titles as I want so I go by aisle to make my shopping a breeze. !
__label__1 app is as advertrised. it is simple to use and set up and best of all, it syncs with my other devises
__label__1 My phone is never out of my pocket. My memory is almost never in my head. Put those two facts together and you have the motivation behind this app.
__label__1 I wish the decimal point was with the numbers though, don't like the extra step.....And you would think the major categories would already be listed as defaults.  Other than that it's really cool.
__label__1 I want to say this is awesome you should get it give me an A give me an W. gimmy an E gimmy an S gimmy an O gimmy an M and gimmy an E
__label__1 Love the bar code part. I always need a list to go grocery shopping and it was so easy to add things that i needed all week
__label__1 Seems to work slick so far. I wish I had a smart phone to take advantage of all the features.
__label__1 Love this app and use it alot.  You can use your voice, type, or scan a grocery list.  Very handy!
__label__1 This app works well! It scans the bar codes easily, even finding store brands without difficulty. Manual input is easy also. As you shop, you can line out items as you find them.
__label__1 I love this app. Its one of my favs of all that I have and I use it all the time on my android phone. I wanted it on my kindle just so that if I wanted to see it a little bigger then I could use it instead of my phone since everything sincs from the inte
__label__1 I use this for my grocery shopping every time.  It's so easy to call up the same things that I buy each month.  No more wondering if I forgot something because my whole list of everything is right there (even if it's not checked off)
__label__1 I love love love this app.  I use it for everything.  I love that I can sync it from my phone to my husband's computer or print it out for him when he goes shopping.  My shopping list is always at hand and up to date.  Plus I can even look up deals at my
__label__1 Very easy to list stuff and mark stuff off.  Bar code scanner is wonderful. It puts the scanned item on your list. Very handy.
__label__1 Just downloaded this so I have had a chance to really use it a whole lot but just looking at it and all of the features I believe this will be one app I won't be able to live without.
__label__1 It's very easy and simple :)I use this to sort my clothes &gt;&bull;&gt;I think you could use this fun app for keeping track of ANYTHING! :D
__label__1 Best Grocery List and Pantry inventory app I have ever used! I have tried so many and always went back to pen and paper. Then I saw this on a Tech site I subscribe to and it is perfect! It's fast and easy to add to your grocer list by typing, speaking, o
__label__1 I don't usually pay for apps.  This was the first of only a few apps that I ever paid for.  I've had it over a year now and use it almost every day.
__label__1 Out of Milk is my alltime favorite app but Amazon is terrible for the slow verification process on updates.  OOM was updated with new features a month ago yet here I sit still waiting for Amazon to release it.  Really?  Either speed up the process Amazon
__label__1 This app is great; not only can I keep a list of what I want to buy at the store but when I am preparing my list, I can scan the bar code and it will add the product to my list.  I can create multiple lists and check things off when I get each item from 
__label__0 Downloaded and bought the unlocked program for it also. I tend to lean toward the simpler programs and to me this isn't one of them. Have tried a couple of other grocery shopping programs and found one that runs circles around this program plus, it's fre
__label__1 I love this App and also use Out Of Milk via the website. It makes creating my lists and sharing it with others, quick and easy! It also keeps track of my cost as I add to is, making budgeting a breeze.
__label__0 I had this on my phone for over 2 weeks, during the past week I started adding items for shopping. Now I'm at the store using the list, suddenly my phone restarted and this app is giving me a msg that it's no longer installed on my phone, only this app, 
__label__1 I will start with the bad part - set up. I know! Amazing it doesn't read minds! It took me a couple days to set it up to start with. I buy things when they are on sale and I have a good size freezer and pantry so I had a lot of things to input. And depen
__label__1 I save paper by not using paper grocery lists, and I don't forget what I went to the store to get. The UPC scan feature is really neat too.
__label__1 I haven't tried any other grocery list app. This is the first one I've used (for the past couple of months) and, since it does a very good job at what it's built for, I see no reason to change. Shortly after I downloaded this for free I purchased the Pro
__label__1 This is a wonderfully helpful app!!  It is so easy to add things right in the kitchen as I run out of things.  Items can be added by bar code scan, typing or voice.  They can very easily be moved to another list or copied to a second list.  new store lis
__label__1 Currently using it for meh b-day list.  worked great...but I had to delete then re-download it because of the update.. but still the greatest list  app out there:) XD :p @__@
__label__1 I have not run out of anything since downloading this app.  Whenever I use the last of "something", or think of something I need I just  key it in.  Then when I shop the shopping list is right there in my phone.  No more paper lists to lose or leave at h
__label__1 Help!! I cant stop scanning bar codes! I've tried many others but this ones a keeper. Being able to scan a bar code &amp; share the list, eliminates any excuse for my hubby buying the wrong product! Creating a pantry list shows me exactly what's in my ca
__label__1 This is definitely one of my favorite and most used apps. I'm not a big 'list' person, but this is so easy to use, so easy to add stuff when i'm thinking about it instead of when I'm on the way out the door. And if I forget to look at it while at the sto
__label__1 This is good product easy use and works well. I have no problems with it and  is easy to use.
__label__1 Very handy app for jotting down things needed at stores.  You can even make different lists for different stops.  And it is quick to get into and put something on list on the go.
__label__1 The major strength of this app is its simplicity. No, it doesn't do everything under the sun, and that's a good thing! It keeps lists, LOTS of lists, and they're easy to use. @ the last reviewer, you can cross off items on the lists by press-and-hold (do
__label__1 easy to use and I love the scanner. My list is complete and easy to read before I leave the house.
__label__1 Finally, a list app that I can categorize by my favorite store's aisles! Easy to add to the list as I shop and when I put the prices in for the items in my cart, it gives me a running total so I know how close I am to my budget.
__label__1 Hubby and I sync all the lists so we have the same info on our Asus tablets.  We can also have unshared lists.  Fabulous!  We have better things to talk about than what we need to remember to buy.  The app is easy to use.  The barcode scanner is responsi
__label__1 I LOVE this app. The interface is well-designed and intuitive. I love being able to edit my lists on my android phone, Kindle or computer. I can share lists with my husband or email them. I can make multiple errands lists and shopping lists by the store.
__label__1 First off I want to say that I'm not a developer for this app. You don't have to be the developer of an app to like it. Believe it or not, people's opinions differ, so just because you don't like something doesn't mean someone else won't as well. Use com
__label__1 Very easy to use and keeps track of your total purchase.  You know if you have enough money to checkout or missed something on your list.  On repeat visits to the store, it's obvious what prices have gone up or down.  Fun app!
__label__1 I use this app on my Kindle HD.  I've tried at least 20 different grocery list apps, and this is the only one I kept. If you are looking for just a quick list, this is the app to use. On the flip side, if you like more info on your list, you have the abi
__label__1 This App is such a great tool without a lot of useless bells and whistles.  For starters, my husband and I share a shopping list, so we are on the same page with what is needed at the store and can update in real time, even as the other is doing the shop
__label__1 I think I use this app more than all of the rest combined.  Great for all kinds of shopping and even budgeting.  I love this app.
__label__0 Not fast and helpful.. I spent more time figuring it out and browsing then it would have taken me to write out a list and go shopping.
__label__1 I liked this app .  Although at times it is hard to download the bar scans into my cell phone.  It is nice to send it to my husband when he is at the store.  He always forgets thr grocery list!
__label__1 Had this app for awhile.  Played around with the data aspects and found that it could do everything I needed and some more...  the new deals feature is awesome.... make life easier for all those time consuming lists and errands...plus I can share lists o
__label__1 The perfect app for those of us in charge of the weekly grocery shopping. This app removes the need for a traditional paper list, and having to make that same (or similar) list week after week. Being able to track the cost of an item from one week to the

__label__1 I have been using this app for about 1 month and love, love, love it!  I started with the free app (which is great) then paid for the unlock app which allows me to do a little more with it (I love bells and whistles).  I don't have a smart phone so I can

__label__1 I definatly liked this app. It was easy to use and a great organizer so that I don't forget the shopping list at home! : ) 5 stars!
__label__1 Have had this since 2012 and used it countless times, as well as suggesting it to others since it's such a useful app.
__label__1 you can add brand name or general items. this is perfect for me since we rely on the paper list on the kitchen counter :-)
__label__1 Having used OurGroceries for about 6 months, I wasn't satisfied with the fact that it was almost never updated and it is just a drag to use visually.  It functioned, but then I tried Out of Milk and was relieved to find out that it did the same things an
__label__1 This is a must have app and I use it on ALL my devices and my partners too so if I have a list of things we need he has one too as they sync up great.
__label__1 I love the Out of Milk, Grocery Shopping List program that I bought for my android smart phone. The program allows you to make up separate customized shopping lists for different stores or occasions and save them to be used over again. You can arrange ea

__label__1 I am using the free version of this app. At first i wondered if i would use it much, but the more I use it the more I find to list out and it is so easy to add and to check off the lists.
__label__1 I love this program.  I've had it for quite a while and just finally set up the ability to sync it online.  Did that because I got a new phone and didn't want to lose all my custom lists!  I have lists for EVERYTHING in here!  It's great!
__label__1 Normally I do not use these kinds of apps. They are more of a hassle than they are convenient. However I thought I would give this a chance. I deleted my previous application and downloaded this one. It surprised me at how easy it is to use. The applicat
__label__1 Excellent app! I will admit that I've not tried others, but I did carefully go over other shopping list reviews and through process of elimination, ended up settling on this one.My priority needs were simple, "I should be able to....":1.  ... make a diff
__label__1 This ap is very helpful.  I can go to my shopping list, or just a general list of things to do without any problem.  Helps me remember what I want to do and have to do.  Haven't tried all of the things yet, but am getting better at working it.
__label__1 reminds me when I need things and the list is easy to find.  App does a lot of things which makes a great help.
__label__0 You can do more with a spreadsheet.Tracks the food you have and need. Very Basic and a huge waste of time.
__label__0 I Had no idea what this app was.... At first I thought it was the game were you milk the cow and see how fast you can fill the farm's milk bucket, boy was I wrong..... All you do is make a stupid list ,that explains the name REALLY I'm  mad. I spent my t
__label__0 I liked Out of Milk quite a lot. It was so useful, I really took the time to fill the pantry with all of my necessaries, and found it very handy for making my shopping list and keeping track of what was needed.On the other hand, when an update was instal
__label__1 I originally purchased the free version - great app so I purchased the unlock $1.99 version. So thrilled with the ease of sharing the grocery list with my husband for those times when I stop by the store without him. I know what he has added to the list 
__label__0 I was really looking forward to using this app, but it froze up my kindle fire hd and wouldn't let me do anything. Im glad i searched for the free version to try it first instead of just buying it like i was going to do... :/
__label__1 This app was exactly what I was looking for. I shop with different needs in mind and this app helps me maintain running list of things without the hassle of pen & paper.  I love the barcode scanning so I can just scan the item when it's running low and n
__label__1 I take my Kindle everywhere.  And I do mean everywhere.  It has become my day planner, my game console, my library and my organizer.  I love, love this app for it's help in that.  The list is easy, the entire app is user friendly.  Watching the creator o
__label__0 While I like this and use it a lot, requiring a list- based app to be removed in order to update, thereby eradicating all lists/data, is IDIOTIC! Solution: dev update protocol should incorporate automatic cloud backup and restore of all user data!
__label__1 Like many of us do I make a list before I go grocery shopping and like many of us also do I forget to take the list with me. However I never leave my home without my phone so therefore thanks to this app I will always have my grocery shopping list with m
__label__1 I had it on my old phone. Just added it to the newone. I use it all the time for more  just groc.
__label__1 I adore this app because it helps you save money. It does this by listing all the stores in your area that have sale items. You can check ShopRite, Walbaums, A&P, Stop & Shop and Pathmark to see what's on sale and then add the item to your list. I saved 
__label__1 Awesome solution for an ongoing problem: How to get the family's shopping lists on the same "page" so to speak. I put this app on all our 'Droids & tablets. I linked them all together with my login (a BARGAIN at $2.99, I paid $4.99 & would again). Now an
__label__1 I just love this app!  I am used to making lists but 9 times out of 10, I forget to take it with me or can't find it.  I can make lists for "things to do" or groceries or all of the stores that I shop at.  Just delete them as you buy them.  I love seeing
__label__1 Downloaded this application on a whim and now it's one of mine and my wife's most used ones. Only gripe is that there is a monthly fee for the pro one instead of a once a year one other than that it's very useful even for the free version.
__label__0 I paid the 4.99 for the lifetime subscription pro version and it will not update. According to marketplace version 2.0.10 is out ant I am still on v2.0.8.Now they have an unlocker out for pro instead of the subscription.The app is ok8/23/11 Amazon versio
__label__1 I'm hard to please, but this app is excellent. Love ability to scan as well as input from scratch. Download!

__label__1 OMG! It works on the kindle fire too! ( first kindle fire) I use it for Christmas lists Its so simple add grocery go to store DONE! LOVE IT!
__label__1 I am only typing this review in response to the several other reviews regarding dev fluff.  The one that really got me was the person saying that it was obviously dev fluff cuz who needs a to-do list app on their phone.  Are you joking or just so egotist
__label__1 I adore this application.  It is easy to set up, maintain, and edit you grocery list.  You can snap a picture of the UPC and it will add the product to the application along with the price.  Then once you have all your groceries added to the list you can
__label__0 I can't figure this one out. Does not work for me at all. Don't waste your time with it. Have a better one on my computer.
__label__0 Too simple for my needs. Too complicated for my wants. Did not work well with other apps. I needed something I could use on my android, laptop and Kindle.
__label__1 I have this on smart phone. My husband has it on iPhone. If i think of something I need from the store when my husband is on way home I just put it on the list, and it sinc's with his phone list and he can get it. He knew how to since. Our phones. Wonder
__label__1 This app is easy to use and simple to understand. I love the pantry feature so I don't over buy spices and essentials. Being able to transfer an item from the pantry list to the shopping list is convenient.
__label__1 My wife and I sync shopping and to do lists. If there is something I want at the grocery or I use the last of something I can put it on the list. Best feature is bar code entry of grocery items while you shop.
__label__1 A very nice and handy app! I use it whenever I go to the super market or to note downn stuff I want to remember.
__label__1 But then, I figured out how to use it and now it's all I use.  Spend the $0.99 for the key, as it's well worth it just to support the developer for such a fine product.
__label__1 Great app for anyone on the go who may forget an item. You can use it for everything.I really use it daily. Great!!!!!
__label__1 This makes my shopping so much easier. You can scan your items or type them in. So many options to make a list, check your items off or delete them, put the prices in the note and it totals your dollar amt. love this app.  My only suggestion would be to 
__label__1 I was laughing when I saw this for free and started reading good reviews, so I tried it.  everything Irradiated was true.It really works very well and is well polished.  Just scan the barcodes off the package as you throw empty boxes out and it adds it t
__label__1 We are snowbirds and retired military. So we shop at several different store.  Safeway, Von's, Lucky's, Military Commissary, Home Depot, Costco and more. The ability to have several different lists is a big help. Also the &#34;Voice&#34;  system works ve
__label__1 I just love this app.  It stores whatever you buy, so you can go thru the history to make more shopping lists.  You don't have to type everything in each time you want to use it.  You can list the price of an item, thereby having a running total of your 
__label__1 (Comic book guy)  best soccer game ever, fun 2 player mode, great ambient sounds, good graphics, and very original method of playing the game,
__label__1 It took quite a number of matches to master the controls. People that complain about the controls probably didn't have enough patience. Lots of different teams. The training mode is unique. unlike other games, this one still has me hooked. They probably

__label__0 I was hoping to be able to let my son listen to radio traffic from his hero, Kyle Bush, but all we can do is look at the schedule and some past results. Turned it on during the Pheonix race and found there is nothing &#34;live&#34; going on. Is there mor

__label__1 I find this app to be extremely helpful in keeping track of all the bills I have. It's really helped me avoid late fees!
__label__1 This is a really great app if you need to keep track of your bills and viewing them by a calendar is the most helpful.  I use this on my kindle fire.  The only downfall is that you can't put in your paydates to counter act the budget.
__label__0 This app doesn't do anything but list bills.  There is no in app calculator, and no way to follow totals within categories.
__label__1 I love this app! I am not a fan of crosswards; but, this app is alot of fun and challenging. Challenging because I have not completed many crosswards maybe? There are only 10 puzzels which is enough for me currently. I may want more later. I like the clu

__label__1 this game is so awesome it is so easy.. i could do an essay and get it done in 10minutes. you all might think it is stupid but it is awesome.

__label__1 Fun puzzles and good exercise for the mind.  Not too difficult and not too easy.  I would recommend to everyone.
__label__1 This game is fun and relaxing! It is challenging but not frustrating. Definitely fun to do on a rainy day or while waiting on someone.
__label__1 I'm not very good at cross words so it's not as hard as the regular ones that you find in the news papers. I would recommend this game for the mentally challenge. lol
__label__0 Very disappointed with the app...which was allegedly free, but after doing about 1/2 dozen puzzles, you had to pay to do more...removing it from my device!!!!!1
__label__1 Great software for quick puzzles.  Easy to use and a lot of fun.  Plenty of puzzles to choose from.  Plenty of levels to choose from.
__label__1 I love this so much. I have always loved doing crossword puzzles. This one lets u unlock more puzzles as u go. I might have to buy the full version because I like it so much!
__label__1 ...to be challenging and easy enough to be fun. I like the settings options, ability to get a small hint, the graphics are good too. You can zoom in/out to see the whole puzzle or part of it. Eventually I'll finish the available puzzles that are free. Th
__label__1 I've only spent a little time using this application on my Kindle Fire HD.  It's easy to use, good size, and hints are adequate.
__label__1 This game is very awesome. It makes you think but if your stuck you can reveal a letter,word,whole puzzel,ir clear it all.
__label__1 I'm hard to please when it comes to crossword puzzle apps, so for me to give it 5 stars really says a lot! I'm loving it so far!  :)
__label__1 I have finished all the puzzles and had a great time doing it.  Will probably get more before too long.
__label__1 so fun! love that you can get a single letter hint when you need just a tiny bit of help.
__label__1 I have really been enjoying Crossword Lite. It is not overly  challenging, yet challenging enough to definitely keep you thinking. I like the way it's arranged and the screens look very nice.
__label__1 Great crossword game! Not only is this FREE, it is challenging, hard work, and a lot of fun! Download today!
__label__1 this is a great set of crosswords. great clue lists and the option for help with word or just a letter.
__label__1 I am purchasing the full version of this app this week. It offers challenging and fun crossword puzzles that will keep your mind stimulated for hours. Where have you been all of my life - is what I say now!
__label__0 I got on the app and all the clues were about other countries or stuff that I haven't even heard aboutJ:
__label__1 A great crossword puzzle app, and is free. A lot of puzzles and you can come back and finish any puzzle you have started or start a new one and come back to finish ones you did not yet.Highly recommended.
__label__1 I have always loved crossword puzzles and they are even better when doing them digital. I had enjoyed it very much and actually bought the full version. It doesn't disappoint.
__label__1 I don't always want to play a fast paced game, and when I don't this little app really comes in handy. Works beautifully on my tablet, with no graphics issues.
__label__1 Sometimes crossword games can seem &quot;judgmental&quot; in the way they punish for getting help or for wrong answers. Instead, this app has positive reinforcement. I appreciate it! :)
__label__1 I signed up for the free app and have done about 5 puzzles on the Kindle Fire.  All is good thus far. Did not look at app price yet to buy the broader set of puzzles and will do so based upon the solid experience of the free (believe it is 40 or so free 
__label__0 This was too hard for me, my vocabulary is not good enough  to work the puzzles, I have to learn more.
__label__1 Challenging, but not impossible. Good variety of clues &amp; answers between puzzles (ie, clues and answers are not repetitive from puzzle to puzzle). Easy to use. Several &quot;helps&quot; to keep your game going.  A must-have for word gamers!
__label__1 I absolutely love my crosswords! I can do them anytime, anywhere I want to. Altho it is an easy version!
__label__1 Really great game. I recommend it to anyone who likes crossword puzzles. Fun to work with. Think you would enjoy it also.
__label__0 I guess I'm only twelve but I tried everything and there was nothing that worked! DO NOT get this game! (unless you're a genius) its extremely difficult and I erased it after about 30 seconds of just trying it out!
__label__0 What I'm looking for is a regular crossword puzzle, like the ones you find in the daily newspaper.  These puzzles are squirrely.  There are all kinds of special clues etc., that detract from just working the puzzle.  If you're a purist, don't get it.
__label__1 This crossword puzzle app is the best! If you get stuck you can choose to have any letter or word revealed. There is an alternate layout to answer each clue horizontally in a much bigger print. Very nice puzzle app! I would buy again from Teasel without 
__label__1 I loved this app.  I am a crossword fanatic and enjoyed doing these on my kindle.  I have purchased other crossword apps, but this one was challenging and easy to use
__label__1 Really don't have any complaints a good free crossword app. I like how you can get a.hint of just one letter and check your work. App will tell you how many words you have correct, how many words you still need to complete and how many you have wrong whe
__label__1 Excellent games.You can set it to indicate the correct letter entry.Easily get the help (complete,letter or word)Open format, the words only connect with one or two letters.Keyboard is quite small so I use a stylus which works very well.(I have fat finge
__label__1 I am not the greatest crossword player so this is just right for me. the puzzles are brief enough to finish in a short time and challenging enough to get my mind working. enjoyable for the person with limited time and short attention span like me.
__label__1 I really like this app. Great puzzles with a lot of real real niice clues. I would recomend to every one. I spend hours on hours doing these puzzles. Thank you very much.
__label__1 Lots of fun!
__label__1 This is great mental and hand exercise.  It keeps your mind learning and builds up hand dexterity.  I am glad to find adult games.
__label__1 User-friendly app that goes well with the Kindle Fire. Lots of puzzles too. Like other reviewers have said; its the British version. ask some words are spelt different; I.e. armour instead of armorial. But still a great app nonetheless.
__label__1 this is a great app if you like crosswords. I'm always looking for apps good to spend a few minutes of waiting
__label__1 Works well on my Kindle Fire.  There are plenty of puzzles to get started with and more to purchase later.Puzzles are fairly challenging.
__label__1 I've tried a lot of different crosswords nd I feel like this one is the perfect one for me! As a young person (17) lots of puzzles have clues that I would never be able to guess-not even in a million years. these crosswords, however, have clues that I un
__label__1 please get scoremobile for other sports!  this app is very fast and useful.  scoremobile apps are great.  I would highly recommend it to anyone who follows soccer.
__label__1 I love this app. It lets me look at the scores and commentary of all my favorite teams in any corner of the world. Five stars and two thumbs-up.
__label__0 Be careful with this App. It is only for one sport - soccer. I have ScoreMobile on my phone, but the Kindle does not have it. Only one I found was this for Soccer.
__label__1 This is the best football (&quot;soccer&quot;) score app out there. Too bad its big cousin ScoreMobile disappeared from the amazon app store.
__label__1 Great cryptic crosswords. I would've liked to be able to tab between clues but that's just quibbling. My chief complaint is that I wanted more puzzles. The app has 4 free but I couldn't figure out where to buy more.
__label__1 ... and have some knowledge of British words. These are British puzzles. They're created well and not too hard as long as you are comfortable with cryptic style crosswords. In a cryptic crossword each clue is a word play of some type. One clue might cont
__label__0 I looked for an easy crossword puzzle game and this one said it was easy. They lied. There's nothing easy about this one. I took it off my device.
__label__0 I found that your crossword puzzles are too hard for me to work and I workpuzzles in the paper every morning.
__label__1 These crossword puzzles were just what I've been looking for! Not too many cryptic ones readily available and these were perfect..not too easy, but not so hard as to make you lose sleep over them. I loved 'em. Thanks for thefreebie! Will definitely pay a
__label__1 I am an immense fan of cruptic crosswords and this app, even its free version was excellent.  I recommend it highly.
__label__1 Extremely hard and gratiflying,to play makes you think and think again...love it to the max....buy it try it do it..
__label__1 Cryptics are crosswords with complicated clues.  Rather than just test your word knowledge, they also test your creativity.  You should be able to find solving techniques on the web.  Highly recommended.This set of puzzles include some easier ones, and p
__label__1 A nice little app which is a useful time waster when waiting for things to happen etc. A well constructed little program.
__label__1 I got this on the basis of other reviews and was not disappointed. I love the access to USGS and topographic maps, and as I moved to low country recently,  I have even used it to research areas nearby.  If I could integrate it with a gps tracking app and
__label__0 Pretty useless if you are looking for elevation detail for a small area with significant elevation changes. And developer does not want to refund.
__label__1 I have been using BCN on my Axim/Windows 5.0 and HTC HD2 /Windows Mobile 6.5.3 for years now and it has been extremely good. I have used it extensively for hiking and backpacking. Now I am running Android 2.3.3 on my HD2, with the new version of BCN and 
__label__1 This app has very good topographical maps. Also has a small compass at the bottom of map. Also gives you heading speed and altitude. Also gives you speed altitude gain, max speed, min altitude, max altitude , max grade, min grade. Nice app for the map lo
__label__0 This is a good mapping app, but the dev has completely stopped updating the app for the Amazon store. DO NOT BUY from Amazon. If you want this app, get it from the Google play store, or find another app here on Amazon. $10 is an expensive app.The dev of 
__label__1 My husband and I have found this to be invaluable. I never thought I'd pay for an app but this one was worth every penny.
__label__0 This app will not run on an Android.  I was going to put it on my phone but it would not load.  So it is of no use if you have a droid.
__label__0 I only had this app on my phone for a week or so and I could never get it to work, right. I'm sticking with RunKeeper!
__label__0 it is not working with sign in with the ap ANDi tried online WTH .  this looks like a cool ap, hope they fix. Samsung Instinct  2.2 OS
__label__1 I signed up for map my run for a run streak challenge...I do like it a lot and it works well for me but one thing I wish I could do is to adjust the verbal updates....I am a time and distance junky so I would like to hear updates more than every mile LOL
__label__0 This product didn't work very good for me.  I live in a very small rural area and it kept telling me that I was running around the lake that I clearly wasn't running around. Not for me.
__label__0 i couldn't set up the account.  i hit &quot;set up&quot; and nothing happened ...four times...nothing happened.  shame too...i really wanted to log my rides
__label__0 When I tried to install it said it was done. But it is not showing up anywhere on my phone. I went back into the amazon app store and it says install pending. I tried everything to get it to change status. powering off the phone wouldnt change the status
__label__1 This app is great. I started using it in July 2013. By keeping track of my rides, distances, elevations, calories burned, etc. I have been able to stay motivated and loose 30 pounds. As a reward to myself I rode a metric century charity ride and was able
__label__1 I find myself playing this alot- fun easy tilt game works great on Kindle Fire. I can't ski in real life-this is a good substitute(-:
__label__1 So I love skiing an whenever I cant do it I play this great substitute!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! LOVE IT GET IT NOW!!!!!!!
__label__1 This app and the hundreds like it help hold my daughter's interest in her Kindle. If she is happy then I am happy.
__label__0 horrible app sucky graphics don't buy it. urhdhsbsjdbd dudgeon dbehe dish dhhshd shbsheh shahs horrible stupid hshd shahs shshhd jdb
__label__1 I absolutely love this game, it's one of my favorite.  There enough challenge to hold my interest but it's also winable.  Warning...this game can be addicting, in a good way.  I hope you enjoy it as much as I do.
__label__1 love this game but one add keeps popping up.  also cant figure out how to put initials in.  it really is addictive.
__label__1 This game is as much fun as playing slot machines and you are not at risk of losing money.  Simple to play, but very entertaining.
__label__1 Had never play this one and sure doenjoy it lots...It is easy and fun..Get it you will enjoy it too..It free too..
__label__1 I love hidden object games, and card games too!  This one is a good one to pass the time.  I love the &#34;quickness&#34; of the game, and you are only playing against yourself.  Lots of fun!  It's a great game!
__label__1 This is a relaxing game. I love playing this when I want something simple to play. I play it alot. Give it a try.
__label__1 Have been playing since got my Kindle.  Love it.  Addicting! Shared with family and they also can't stop.  Just don't understand why the name is Home Run??
__label__0 There are several games that I have loaded and it tells me it is already in my library but I'm unable to find it on my Kindle.  I don't know if I need something else loaded first????
__label__1 I find this game fast and a lot of fun to play.  Euchre is a game I play often with friends and find this good practice.
__label__0 I love Eucher but this was too busy. Deleted it right away, there are better Rucher games out there. Yuk
__label__0 I like playing Duchenne but there was something about this app that just didn't appeal to me, so I deleted it.
__label__0 I didn't like this verson of Euchre at all. I ended up getting rid of it and finding another version. If I could have given it zero stars, I would have.
__label__0 this is an awful version of this game.  ads after EVERY hand?  ridiculous!!!  and the the game was over after 3 hands?  waste of time!
__label__1 At first this game was frustrating because there were no examples of a completed puzzle, but I muddled through.  Will be posting pictures of what Sea Wolf Bar #1 and #2 look like completed.  Solution #1 is a star, I'm thinking it's supposed to be a starf
__label__1 I've not played a puzzle game like this before. It's a simple concept but can be quite a challenge. The closest game I know to compare this to is Picross without the numbers.
__label__1 I love these kinds of puzzles its very challenging and addictive as well. if you get stuck on a problem look at the lamps and the strings turn. try to make them fit into places naturally. I'm stuck on Mon Ami Cafe 7/8.
__label__1 I really enjoy this game, because it is non-threatening (not timed) and easy to play, yet it stretches my mind to find the best solution for the most points.
__label__0 This app was slow and the graphics crude. Deleted it. Sorry but there are much better free apps out there.
__label__0 When i tried to use this game it takes over the kindle and i could not get out of it unless i turned kindle off.
__label__1 This is a fun albeit simple little game. I can waste time playing it for hours. It can be quite addictive for sure.
__label__1 I am hopelessly addicted to this game. My husband had it on his machine and said that I should try it, and now I am addicted. I am extremely pleased with this game.
__label__1 This is a great games, it really make you think in what you are doing. I love playing this game
__label__0 I love the Jewels type games.  This one was definately NOT up to the Jewels Star level....it looks to be a cheap imitation. I have already deleted it off my Kindle.
__label__0 This version is not as challanging or responsive as &#34;Bejewelled&#34; Other jewel games are around that will play much better.
__label__1 I am totally enjoying this game, it is very similar to bejeweled except that you can move on the diagonal with this game which makes it a lot more fun
__label__0 this game was really really slow. if it was faster I would love this game. I wouldn't get this game. sorry.
__label__1 Great game to keep your mind going and thinking, I work with this everyday. A must have for anyone who like thinking games.!
__label__0 When you are playing the game everything is like it is in slow motion. I would not recommend this game.
__label__1 I downloaded a few of these games for my mother-in-law because she kept killing my battery on my phone so now she kills my kindle LOL!
__label__1 My husband loves this game. I do not. For some reason, i just have a hard time figuring it out, but as long as my husband likes it, it will remain on the Kindle.
__label__1 I think this is an Easy Game to play.  It is Challenging to me.  I Enjoy playing it often and usually play each time I pick up my Kindle Fire.
__label__0 Too hard to make matches.  Needs more instructions.  Played several times before I found out you could make matchs diagonally.
__label__1 Love all the jewels, gems, and diamond games where you match up three or more.  Have lots of fun and get hooked.  Don't want to stop
__label__1 Love this game when I just want to relax.  It's fun, challenging and relaxing to me.  I really enjoy playing it.
__label__1 Love playing games and this is a great one. Easy but not too easy! Great price~! Would recoomend this to all the people who love to play games on device's
__label__1 It is the next best thing to Bejeweled. It is a lot of fun to play. plus it is free. Marilyn Remus, Michigan
__label__1 I enjoy this game and like that you can move diagonally. It can be come addictive and your other work doesn't get done.
__label__1 THIS GAME IS VERY FUN TO PLAY AND YOU CAN REALLY GET HOOKED ON IT. I FIND MYSELF NOT WANTING TO PUT MY TABLET DOWN WHEN I PLAY.
__label__1 Classic Jewels is a lot of fun and captures your attention right away.  Cannot put it down once started.  Don't start if you are short on  time as it can be so fascinating that you won't put it down.
__label__1 You can play this game for hours and not get tired of it.  It is challenging to find the most gems in a row to earn more points.
__label__1 I love this game, Bejeweled 2 was my favorite game like this, but after playing this I think it's as good or better. Most games like this don't move diagnal but this one does and it adds to the exitment. A+
__label__0 Prefer the Bejeweled game I've played on my sons I-Pad.  This one on the Kindle is very boring. Hope the Kindle will soon have another option. I've tried them all that are currently on the Kindle. None are fun for me.
__label__1 I truly enjoy playing this game. I highly recommend classic jewel for peoples enjoyment. It gives me lots and lots of pleasure.
__label__1 This game really gets your mind and eyes working.  I truly would recommend this game to all of my family and friends.  I have a hard time quitting this game.
__label__1 I downloaded it and figured it was  a lame Tetris ripoff from its icon. Little did I know, it was a outstanding game. Its a really cool little game and very tricky on some levels. I'd easily say this game is a good deal for .99.I would say for anybody lo
__label__1 you should give out 5free hints every time you want to and you should have a cheat app for it
__label__1 This game is great if you want to exercise your mind and waste time. If you are a visual learner, then this game is just what you need.
__label__1 I like the concept. I thought it was another Tetris clone, but I clearly misjudged that assumption. I got this for the free app of the day, but if you're a someone who loves puzzles that make you think a little hard, but not too hard, this game is for yo
__label__1 Just bought this before it went free :( Works great on the Motorola Xoom (Android 3.1). Fun and addicting. Great puzzler.
__label__1 This is one of those love/hate things for me. Some levels can be done on my first try and then I work on others until I am ready to throw the phone ... yet can't just walk away.
__label__1 I love this game!!  It's awesome fun.  Screen calibration seems a bit off but it runs fine on a Coby Kyros 7024.
__label__1 This is the perfect example that for a game to be good it doesn't always have to have 3rd graphics and hog all your phone's resources.This game is great,  simple concept,  and good implementation. Keeps me busy whenever I have a little time to kill.Well 
__label__0 Amazon has never been updated. V 1.1 released in March, android market is on v 1.3 last updated in October. Buy elsewhere, if at all.
__label__1 I hated tangrams as a kid. But for some insane reason I cant stop playing this! I keep going and going and going and it has a song like Tetris that doesn't drive you to play or away. It's burned in my mind! Can't stop playing... Must finish game... Five 
__label__1 This is a very fun and challenging game. Starts off very easy and gets to be downright difficult. Works great on droidx.
__label__1 An excellent little puzzle game, reminiscent ofTangoes, except you cannot rotate the pieces, which actually makes it a bit easier.  It's a great game for exercising the creative portion of your brain.  It's also one you can pick up and put down very quic
__label__1 beyond fun! beyond addicting! challenging and just plain awesome! tetris only m better! music is cool too and catchy. works flawless on my LG Ally. worth the $1!
__label__1 Didn't think I would like it but I was wrong!  I started playing and the time flew! The game handles well and is not so hard that I just get  frustrated and quit! Great game!
__label__1 I am enjoying this application quite a bit. simple but well done. the soundtrack is wonderful ad well. worth the price at 99 if you didn't get it free.
__label__1 Worth way more than a buck, and abso-friggin'-lutely worth a download when it's free.  I'm glad I snagged it when I did. :-DI'd recommend this to amybody who loves tetra/penta-mine style games.
__label__1 This game is very simple, but well executed. It&apos;s excellent as a time waster but engaging enough to play longer than 10 minutes. The art style is very nice.
__label__1 This game is easy to start but gets increasingly difficult.  Reminds me of tangrams.  Simple UI. Choose light graphics or dark.
__label__1 Love it. Simple concept executed perfectly. Why can't more apps be like this. It is a must have for thinkers.
__label__1 I'm a big fan of puzzle games, and this one has quickly become my favorite.  The clever use of 'tetris' like pieces and interesting puzzle shapes make this a must have!
__label__1 Typical puzzle game with great controls.  Really I think the fact that you don't have to put your finger over the puzzle is quite innovative.
__label__1 well organized and thought out game, lures you in with easy puzzles then gets progressively harder. great free app for the day, and worth purchasing for those that, missed the window.
__label__1 This game really makes you think. I would have to say if Tetris was more puzzler than speed,  this is what it would be. Doodle Fit.Soundtrack is also very catchy. Would recommend to anyone. Well worth the $1.
__label__1 nice puzzler, graphics and controls are vey nicely done.  finally someone does drag and drop the right way, shifting the object out from under your finger so you can see what you're doing.
__label__1 At a buck for this app, you'll get your money's worth. It is a great way to fill a few idle minutes, though you may find yourself playing quite a bit more. The "hand drawn" style of the interface is whimsical and fun. Nice work, guys.
__label__1 i love this game. it&apos;s simple but addicting- i do entire packs at a time! i try to solve without clues butfind myself needing them more and more as the puzzles get harder! i got thi as free app of day but would def spend a dollar for it.
__label__1 lots of fun, well worth a buck, been using free version for few weeks. amazon rocks! . . . .  .  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
__label__1 This is a simple game and helps exercise the part of your brain that controls spacial recognition.  It is amazing how something so simple can actually leave you scratching your head trying to find a solution.  It seems the more you play, the harder it ge
__label__1 First levels are super easy, and I was worried that it would not be challenging.  Now that I am on the third level it sometimes takes me a while to complete just one puzzle.  I got it for free but I definitely think it is worth a buck or more.
__label__1 I love this game so much on my phone but I would love it even more if I could have it on my kindle for free. so unfair :(
__label__1 I downloaded this app when it was the free app of the day, but I would most definitely would have paid for it if I had tried it on a friend's phone and wanted it for myself.  I'm a puzzle addict and love having one in my pocket at all times.Music can get
__label__1 Smooth, fun, challenging,  great graphics. Pretty much a win win game. Glad I got it for free!  Can't stop playing
__label__1 I downloaded this and haven't been able to put it down! Some are easy and some aren't. Good time waster!
__label__1 Just a simple and beautiful game no bells and whistles but just a nice tablet puzzle game with quality simple graphics..
__label__1 I really enjoy this game and even do &#34;pass and play&#34; style with my girlfriend if I get stuck, UI and the overall theme are both amazing. A mind boggler on some of the harder levels, has great replay value.
__label__1 This game is just simply AMAZING! I would not have been disappointed even if I payed $5 for this. While this is not everybody's cup of tea, if you like this kind of brain teaser (and I LOVE these) you will be very satisfied.The puzzles range from VERY ea
__label__1 I'm addicted to this game. I got it when it was free but would have definitely paid .99 for it. Works great on my HTC inspire.
__label__1 I got it while it was free, but it's worth $.99. Easy to pick up; nice, clean graphics; becomes quite challenging in later levels. Very nicely made game.
__label__1 Wonderful design, great graphics, easy controls. Music could use a little variety. Hope you Luke the game as much as I did.
__label__1 this is an entertaining game. I love puzzles, and anyone who enjoys a good brainteaser will love it. very satisfied. no technological lag or ads. definitely worth the 99 cents.
__label__1 Simple yet addicting and challenging. I love puzzles of all kinds and this is a great addition to my growing collection. It can be frustrating to solve some but when you do, it&apos;s a great feeling..haha! Plus it&apos;s good to make your brain work onc
__label__1 I was ready to pass on this free app of the day since it looked like others I had tried. but I'm glad I didn't.Its a lot of fun, easy at first but gets challenging towards the end of the first round. It has a unique and fun concept to design of the game.
__label__1 So much better than I expected from the pics.  Works well on my phone &amp; even better on my Asus Transformer tablet.
__label__1 This game is extremely fun for those who like puzzle games. there are almost always a variety of ways to complete a puzzle and I enjoy that aspect of the game. I would recommend it if you love puzzle games.
__label__1 VERY ENTERTAINING, NEVER BORING, SMART DESIGN. I PLAY IT ALL THE TIME. I HAVE LOOKED ALL OVER FOR SOMETHING SIMILAR, BUT CANNOT FIND!  GREAT WORK, VERY CREATIVE!  THANKS!
__label__1 Great Fun 4 all ages love this game. Like the music. Good free app reminds me of phitdroid. Have a great day!
__label__1 Absolutely loved the game. Easy gameplay, fun, and doesnt score anything, which is a relief because I hate when games remind me I suck at them.
__label__1 Love the way it challenges and keeps you thinking...I am not good in tetras but this is better. It gives you time to figure it out where to for those doodle.
__label__1 the &quot;sketch/drawn&quot; style is unique and fun. i like that it is not like tetris. no rotation, etc. very fun.i enjoy puzzles and this is a very fun one. recommend Downloading.
__label__1 Nice game.  blah.  Blah.  Blah.  why twenty words minimum.  Nice graphics. Blah blah. Fun game.  Interesting.  Good stuff.  Three two.  One.
__label__1 I wasn't sure about this have at first, but it really is fun and very addicting. Works nice and smooth on my droid x
__label__1 This is a fun little app and can actually become quite complicated to complete once you really get into it. Well worth getting. Thank you amazon for this fun free app!
__label__1 works on nook color running cm7.  thanks.  looks good and great for short bursts. great for spacial reasoning.  great app
__label__1 Amazing graphics!  Killer sound track! Ultraresponsive controls! This game will have you riveted to the edge of your seat for hours of non-stop puzzle game play action!!  ...actually, it is a pretty fun game, and for free...yah, I'll clog up my phone's m
__label__1 Took me 20-30 hours to solve all of the puzzles. Helps kids with visualizing geometric solutions, but my kids haven't really played it much.
__label__1 This game possess a challenge and you get hooked easily. thanks appstore for your free ap a day, but I don't think bosses will appreciate my inactivity at work.
__label__1 This is a nicely designed and challenging puzzle-style game.  Kudos to the developer for creating a game that scales nicely to the Kindle Fire's screen.
__label__1 This game is fun and addicting. Between this and the other fun stuff you have been giving out lately, I am getting no work done. Please stop! :)Thank you to the Doodle Fit folks for making such a cute, fun game. I loved tangrams as a kid and this is just
__label__1 Doodle Fit is a brilliant execution of a very simple concept.  Simply fill in the given shape with a predefined assortment of smaller shapes (similar to Tetris pieces).  The pieces must fit perfectly, with no gaps, and without going outside the bounds of
__label__1 This game is incredibly fun and actually challenging! I enjoy it a lot. It looks good, plays good, and there are lots of levels. Well worth $0.99!
__label__1 I was really surprised how quickly I got sucked in. I thought it was too easy at first and then... I got stumped, and I was determined to solve it without using a hint. A few hours later, I find myself craving more!
__label__1 A fun and fresh take on the classic game Tangrams, Doodle Fit is fun, fanciful and best of all free (today only). I would've paid a dollar for it easily, though! Grab it!
__label__1 I really like this app. planing a trip to England in a few months and this app should come in real handy. from what I&apos;ve used it looks great and has not force closed yet.
__label__1 I've used this to record and tag photos during trips. I prefer to use my DSLR for taking photos of important trips, but for quick shots my phone is adequate and can be used with the trip journal.
__label__0 1.- It seems to conflict with other apps installed on the phone.  In my particular case; it Force-Closed when one of my alarms popped-up (I am using Alarm Xtreme).2.- Second try:  I started a trip (it did not get my location correctly, btw), took some ph
__label__1 Great to record for your memories of special vacations or even to laugh at later!  Beautiful interface.  Well done.\n\nTo the person who doesn&apos;t like this app because he or she doesn&apos;t want to get robbed, you could either a) share your trip whe
__label__0 Though I am pretty sure the program was called Facebook. It might be just me but if you paid for this, you haven&apos;t heard of Facebook.
__label__0 This app has the potential but isn&apos;t there yet. Problems ranging from crashes to poor gps data are holding it back. Right now, im found back to using MyTracks. Simple but have had no problems unlike this app.
__label__1 I don&apos;t think some people understand  this whole permissions  issue at all. It seems that some reviewers  are under the impression that an app will actually &quot;read&quot; the content of your email, as in read for understanding.  So if they wrote 
__label__1 it's cute, i like it. I don't know if I'd ever pay for it but it's nice for free. of course it's a battery drain, it's live wallpaper. don't like the concept then don't use it. I'm glad amazon offers a variety of things instead of just games every day.
__label__0 Who made this??  A first year computer science student?  I don't understand how Amazon manages to pick these.  do they even look at them first?  Unoriginal... bad graphics... horrible landscape/portrait transitions... Pour some effort into it, Dev!
__label__1 This is an adorable wallpaper with loads of customizations. Seasons and choice of plants, car and people speeds keep it from getting boring. It installed and ran without a hitch on my HTC Incredible. Like most live wallpapers, it's a battery eater, but a
__label__1 This is a good wallpaper that changes with the seasons.  Able to customize animations.  Graphics are good for a simple concept. Works fine on the Droid x.
__label__0 Sounded like a good idea but won't open. have a xoom. Am going to uninstall if it will let me.
__label__0 this doesn't look like my house at all. And the street is all wrong. and it's not even fun.I am not the developer, I promise.
__label__1 i love the fact that people will fall apart over a cute live wallpaper and flame it to death as if it ruined their lives
__label__1 It's a cheery looking wallpaper. The customization options are pretty decent. I think there are way too many people walking about for suburb street, but other than that I can't fault this one. Looks great on the Asus Transformer.
__label__1 I love this wallpaper.  First, let's remember that this is wallpaper, not a game, so we can't give it a bad review for lack of complexity.  I mean, really, how complex of the wallpaper you have right now?It's a nice scene to have on the background of you
__label__1 what makes you think that they even trying to get awesome graphics going. this could be the look they where looking for. all you have to do is look at the pictures and see that its cartoons. hell look at the wii!!!!
__label__0 do not buy this app. it doesn't work on the HTC EVO phone. looked like a fun game too :(
__label__1 So you cant interact with the background (not a big deal for me). I like the colorful background and animations, looks very fall festive. In the settings you can change the animation speed, which I did to slow because medium seemed a bit fast for my eyes
__label__1 Not a bad app...does what it says it does.  didn't crash DROID x.  no silly permissions.  prefer environment awareness, but not holding it again the dev.
__label__1 Good fun live wallpaper.  My kids like to hold my phone and play around and they are enjoying this one.  Animation is just fine, not everything needs to look like a Tim Burton movie.
__label__0 I have d/l and installed twice, haven't been able to find it to launch it, and when I go to the link on the Amazon store, the 'Open' option is greyed out. Anyone else seeing this?
__label__1 i like cute, and this is super cute. i can't wait to see if it changes for all the holidays.
__label__0 Saying this is lame is an understatement.I would rather stab myself again than use this again. waste of space like my sister
__label__1 I is so sick of stereotypes and dis app jus promotes dem. I ain't seen no black peoples runnin around da burbs. It's all white folks lookin happy. Heck, I half spected to see a black man runnin down da street with a purse or sometin. This app ought to le
__label__1 nice little wallpaper. good for a free app of the day. figures there are still damn idiots on here that always rate low. i figured they would be gone by now, but not.anyways download this, nice wallpaper, keep you the good work.
__label__0 horrible live wallpaper not worth a penny in my book I got it for free and I am happy I didn't pay a cent. I would never use this. I never really ise live wallpapers in the first place though. DONT BUY
__label__0 very boring wish u couod click on people and have them actually do something. the same blue car keeps driving by. do like free live wallpaper just wish it was good Free wallpaper
__label__1 I loved this game! It was impossible to put down! I wish there were more like it. It was challenging yet  not impossible.
__label__1 I like puzzle games and this on is addictive.  Very much like bejewelled. You can compete with the computer or play solo. I've had it for about 2 weeks with no tech problems like freezing.
__label__1 Absolutely love this app. Great casual game to pick up from time to time. A lot like bejeweled but a little more fun and challenging. Definitely can't go wrong.
__label__1 Anyone who says this ends on 45 seconds sucks at this game. I got to level seven the first time I played. Cool game. Interesting idea!
__label__1 I think that this is a challenging, but additive app. It is a great way to pass some time. It's hard, but not overly so and it gets easier the more you practice. It's fun.
__label__1 like the old palm daisy game.not too hard, not too easy.a bit pricey, but not today.all in all a good effort.
__label__1 This is most fun app i've downloaded off Amazon... I just can't get enough of this game. I love how it just keeps switching it up.
__label__1 I wouldn't pay $2.50 for this... $.99 seems more appropriate. but it is entertaining and not as bad as a lot of people are saying. wish there could be different modes of play, though.
__label__1 This is a good game to fill some time. Starts real easy then gets a little tougher.Keeps me occupied for a while.
__label__1 graphics are nice considering its just balls of color. sound effects and music aren't anything special nor are they annoying. Once you hit level ten things get very challenging relying far more on school than luck. My seven year old played and got to lev
__label__1 great app. works well on Evo. addictive and unpredictable makes it challenging every game. well worth the money spent on it.
__label__1 This game is pretty nice if you like action puzzles.  Very Colorful, nice soundtrac and Fun to play.  It is not any super game but a simple Brain exercise style game that keeps you interested for awhile.  Thanks.
__label__1 i really like this app. the graphics are absolutely stunning and the game is both addicting and challenging. definitely worth the download.
__label__1 I think my title says it all. Worked great on both my EVO 3D and my Galaxy tab. I prefer the galaxy tab because of the bigger screen size, but still carry it around on my 3D in case I have some downtime on the go. It takes a little bit to figure out how 
__label__1 My first impression was this looks weird. And it was weird playing at first. But! That's what makes it so awesome! its unique and once you get used to the game play this game is freaking fun! fast paced and challenge! its like if bubble breaker met Bejew
__label__1 I downloaded this when it was the free Amazon App of the Day. Many of those reviews came in negative and fast. However, most of them did not take the time to get to know this game.Many complained that you just kept tapping the button to automatically cle
__label__0 what is up with the excessive permissions? a game should NOT need that much acsess to my stuff!! No thank you!!!!
__label__0 It's very frustrating when a game that requires you to do a reasonable amount of button mashing doesn't save your progress if you inadvertently press the back button.
__label__1 i absolutely love this game. its quick and easy but you still have to focus and think about whats going on
__label__1 i like a good time waster and this one is great. lots of moving parts great graphics, interesting concept. enough logic to make it fun without being frustrating.
__label__1 this app is a great way to pass the time. easy to play. can pick it up when u have a few moments to wait, or when a long wait
__label__1 I play this game a lot and am surprised at some of the reviews. It does involve strategy. For example, there are four power-up options, one in each corner. To play the game, you link three or more same-colored balls by spinning circles to connect them. Y
__label__1 A new spin on the match 3 game this game provides hours of entertainment.  I find myslef playing all the time.
__label__0 It looks good but it's just not very fun. It doesn't offer anything that other matching type games do, and I found myself just mashing the execute button because it seemed like the dots always lined themselves up. Not very challenging or involving.
__label__0 Seemed like a decent game but it's anything but. It claims to require strategy but the timer runs way too fast to allow any sort of strategy. All you have to do is keep hitting the solve button and move things around. Not very challenging, imo. 1 out of 
__label__1 I enjoyed the game it is a fast pace game that pushes your thinking and reactions skills constantly. If you like this in a game you should enjoy this game.
__label__1 I said if I saw another bejewled spinoff I would puke. And I just did. I spewed all over my laptop. Now I have to contact customer service at Amazon to get this thing cleaned.
__label__1 another day another good time killer app. nice faotd if you ask me. once again , another app getting rated low, what is up with these stupid people, everyday the apps get rated low by the same people. do yourself a favor go read the reviews in the androi
__label__1 I downloaded Spinball this morning and played it while riding the train.  It is a fun version of the typicial "match color" games you see like Bejeweled.  You have to spin the different wheels to get the colors to match.  I like this because this is a ti
__label__0 Unfortunately, I find myself needing to uninstall this derivative yet amusing game. The developer decided to grant this application permission to modify battery statistics, in addition to full internet access and phone id. Otherwise, gameplay is fairly i
__label__0 Was fun... For a min... Then crashed. Had to pull the battery to restart my defy. Great graphics. What else to say?
__label__1 99c is really a bargain.  Its a fun little story with entertaining character development.  Beat in about 5 hours of play.  Glad i bought the game.
__label__1 If you like rpgs this should definitely be in your collection. The gameplay is great and easy to control. Great graphics and runs great. Get it while its only 99c worth it and then some.
__label__0 if you watch the video, it says full and free. if its supposed to be free why are they charging money for this?
__label__1 This game is easily counted among my favorite Android games. $1 for 6 hours of fun is a bargain by any standards (and that was just my first playthrough). Highly, highly recommended. Would gladly pay for a sequel or even another game with the same or sim
__label__1 Good story, great gameplay, and a good price. It uses the &quot;pause-give orders-pause&quot; method of fighting much like Baulder's Gate or Dragon Age(the first one). Sadly, the story is short, especially for taking down an all-powerful corporation, but
__label__1 I'm playing this on a Kindle Fire, and it's quite amazing.Most of the games out there for tablets, phones, and what have you are casual affairs.  Even the ones that aren't tend to skew towards the "short and sweet" end of the spectrum.So I was looking fo
__label__1 Like the other reviews said, this has a strong Shadow Run feel to it.  With decent animations and a clean, well thought out interface it's easy to pick up and hard to put down.  Worth the $.99 and then some.
__label__1 by far one of the best cyberspace punk games in year let alone it being a mobile is even more impressive. nice LENGTH, GRAPHICS &amp; Gameplay. My own gripe is too few songs leads to the title feeling somewhat repetitive. other than that well worth the l
__label__1 At first I was a little put off by the cartoony graphics but then I immediately got lost in the very rich and immersive setting, characters, and story. The character customization and leveling really scratches the rpg itch. And the graphics have really g
__label__1 This game has, a great story, great dialog, and overall great gameplay. My only complaint is that I wish it was longer
__label__1 This game worked very smooth on my Kindle Fire. What it might lack in depth, it makes up in game length especially in this Free version. Kinda makes me wonder what more or how much longer the Full version is.
__label__1 This is a great book to read if you are in the Information Security Field and trying to stay abreast of your field.
__label__1 A wonderful aid for anyone, young or old preparing for Confession.  Especially helpful for new or returning Catholics.  Each person in the family can use it (each person has their own password) and it is private for each.  The Examination Of Conscience, 
__label__0 Do you really have to pay to confess your sins?  I thought that practice ended with the Dark Ages...seriously, forgiveness is free.
__label__1 The app is so good I think I will keep it for a while.  I am in AA and appreciate this also
__label__0 has several versions of the act of contrition to choose from. you can follow an entire rosary, stations of the cross, or simply say some Catholic prayers .... free
__label__1 This is a great app to help all Catholics make a good examination of conscious before going to confession.I recommend all Catholics get this one.
__label__1 Excellent. Its only flaw is that when I touch the screen in the wrong spot I cannot correct it. The app would be improved by adding -- besides the questions centered on the Commandments -- some questions about the Seven Deadly Sins. Examination that incl
__label__0 I was really impressed with this app.It had everything i wanted when i looked thru it the 1st time but then i signed off. When i tried to get back on the app would not open again
__label__1 Absolutely great for calculating expenses. Even my fiancee loves it for grocery shopping. Definitely worth the money. Get it for sure.
__label__1 I like the imitation tape that allows you to check your math without re-calculating.  Good tool in my arsenal...well done!
__label__1 Great product. I would encourage everyone looking for a calculator app to look no further than this one! It works perfectly.
__label__1 I have tried several calculator apps on my phone, but I like this one the best. Has many functions, but if you are doing just simple math applications it allows you to do them quite easily.
__label__1 Amazon's FAOTD is so RARELY anything useful like this app, it's so refreshing to see something other than a silly game game geared to the tweeners rather than than their real market, the baby boomers.  This product is great.  Very basic calculator with a
__label__1 This was actually the first paid app I ever bought of the Google Play Store about 3 years ago and it has been a &quot;must install&quot; app on every phone I have had since then. I use it constantly.  I love the &quot;tape&quot; feature.  It has never gl
__label__1 I own several calculator app's-- this is the ONLY calculator where you can actually see your input up to the final calculation.  This is important, especially if you've got more than 10 lines in a calculation.Great app, fa sho!
__label__1 I've been using the free version for years, and have almost purchased the Pro version several time, and would have if I used it for more than balancing my ledger every month. So happy that I waited and get it for free! Thanks Amazon!
__label__1 I just downloaded it because it looked like it could be useful when shopping looking at the screen shot. This is so much better than the stock calculator. You can see your whole list of expenses and edit it as you need to. I'm reading the reviews and eve
__label__1 Great calcutator for work and home.  Was very pleased.  Easy to use and understand.  Would recomend this app. to all.
__label__1 if I didn't have dis app I would have failed class it would be kinda ok but not the other side... the consequences so ya
__label__1 While a calculator pretty much does the same thing, math, this one has one advantage over others that I have had, a virtual tape. So many times I wish I could review the numbers entered, or the arithmetic key struck? With this app I can see just that inf
__label__1 Well it keeps lists so you know what each number is for, kind of good if its pretty much the same every month, but it just does calculator stuff too.
__label__1 I have several calculators and use different ones for different jobs.  The useful functions here include the settable number of decimal places, the double zero button, etc.  I like the all of the options & settings possible. Love the auto decimal point m
__label__1 It's hard to find a great calculator for a smartphone, you always end up using the one that came stock, but this one is nice. Now if only these apps will include a widget for a basic calculator so I can just turn on my smartphone and scroll to one of the
__label__1 Great Calculator App! Love that you can edit it to make paying bills so much easier. Would love a send to printer mode.
__label__1 Has most the functions you need for all the operations in arithmetic or your office  you can think of yea
__label__1 I like the way this calculator has been put together to carry out fraction calculations. This is simple easy and great! Thank you!
__label__1 This is going to be very handy when I'm preparing a deposit. Until now I would add all the checks using my phone's calculator, enter the total on the slip, then subtract them all back out. If I ended back at zero, I knew I hadn't mis-entered anything. If
__label__1 This works just fine...would work for things like grocery shopping or others when your trying to keep track of a list of items and just as a basic calculator
__label__1 I love the Office Calculator pro and am enjoying using it whenever the need arises.  I use my Kindle Fire often so have this at my finger tips every day.
__label__1 As a retail manager this calculator is great. It makes counting safes and drawers much easier with the &quot;tape&quot;. It has replaced my huge, clunky, and loud calc in the office when the tapes don't need printed. I have a few task that require the pr
__label__1 This app, like Panecal, also does multiple calculations.  Very useful for taking care of your books or other similar applications.
__label__1 A pet peeve is not being able to see entries.  This gives you the ability to run a visual tape.
__label__1 We enjoyed using this app. The size of the keys is great.Love that you can see the tape while you are working.
__label__1 Got this app as FAOTD! Quite satisfied with it. Would be great if there was a print option with this to print out for record keeping.
__label__1 This is just what is says it is, a basic office calculator with tape display.  The tape is just great for showing a series of calculations and being able to check your data entry.  This IS NOT a financial calculator and is not presented as such.  I like 
__label__1 I've actually used the free version of this calculator for quite a while, but the ads got to be too annoying and distracting so I just recently deleted it to use a different one. But I really liked the tape feature on this simple calculator. Delighted to
__label__1 It is a calculator. It works well. End of story - what you see is what you get. And best of all - it uses relative little space.
__label__0 Its the worst app u can possibly get its hard to understand how to use it I needed it for my math it sucked it is weird to use also
__label__1 Having a virtual tape following your entries is huge when entering a string of numbers. Easy to see buttons.... Good App.
__label__1 Absolutely the greatest calculation app out there!!!With this I'm faster than the dispatchers at quoting the customers a price!!!  I love it!!!
__label__1 The free version of Office Calculator was one of the first apps that I downloaded on my original Kindle Fire in 2011. It quickly became my favorite, most used calculator. Office Calculator is a great basic four-function calculator than runs very well on 
__label__1 My LG phone came with a built in calculator that had (+ - x & division). When I go food shopping and have to do percentages my phone could not do it easily. So this app really comes in handy. Has a percent key and memory. I know It's not high tech but it
__label__1 Great calculator. Loved the free version so, I opted to pay for no adds. Plus I like supporting developers that produce great apps.  Best calculator for the Kindle Fire in my opinion.
__label__1 This fine application is handsomely presented with a GUI that rules. From simple math to running totals and easy percentage calculations. I have tried many others, but they fell way short in one way or another. If my brain were a calculator, this is how 
__label__1 When you have a tablet, smart phone or smart device you need to have a good calculator. This is a good one and I like it because of the virtual printed tape feature. The numbers and arithmetic step you have entered are shown on a white calculator tape th
__label__1 Perfect as an easy to use calculator. The low price was worth paying for the PRO version to remove the ads.
__label__1 I replaced my existing, add filled, calculator with this one during a free app day and have no complaints. It works great and it's nice to have the ticker to check my work. What more needs to be said?
__label__1 This is the best calculator I have used on any device. I love the running tape that is almost impossible to find anywhere else. I don't care what calculator comes pre-installed on any of my devices....I will boot them out & change to Office Pro. Thanks g
__label__1 I like this calculator for school because it has all the function I need for math class and graphic design. It is not difficult to use because I understand it.
__label__1 But when I need it I like the additional applications that go beyond the very basic calculator I first downloaded.
__label__1 I am a teacher and I love this calculator.  I can do my grades several different ways.  Love the virtual paper.
__label__1 This is an unusually useful app.  The ability to label items you are adding, the ability to delete &amp;/or edit individual lines in a calculation, and even better,  to be able to store items in a cloud.  All of these things combine into a terrific resou
__label__1 I had the free version and now have the Pro version with no ads.I like the ribbon, so I can see the numbers I have input.  And I like how clear and simple the calculator is on my screen.It does what it is supposed to do, and does it quite well.
__label__1 I agree....amazon should buy this app for standard apps on all their readers. tablets.... I appreciate the clear work of the app developer...this should be a case study of a good app...I'm not an expert @ these things...but the &quot;vibe &quot; is right
__label__1 I'd been using Office Calculator Free for a while, so I was happy to be able to upgrade to Office Calculator Pro when it was free app of the day.This is really just a basic arithmetic calculator. Functionality is quite limited. However, calculator apps t
__label__1 Excellent calculator.  I especially like the print out feature.  Buttons are big and easy to use.Highly recommend if you are looking for a calculator.
__label__1 Easy to use, to the idiot that couldn't figure out how to add text, you just right click on the line once its displayed. there is picture showing that.I love the tape feature,  greatly recommended.
__label__1 This calculator app is excellent.  It's extremely convienient in that I can easily add or subtract a %, (I use it at times to  add sales tax) as well as being accurate.  It's very attractive with beautiful colors & has a nice, large keyboard so it's easy
__label__1 I use the calculator for basic tasks, but it always works, its accurate and it hasnt crashed on me yet.  Good free app of the day.
__label__1 Does exactly what it says. Very customizable. I like the descriptions for each setting. Its more than ill ever need but looks like it will be handy. D/l as FAOTD but think it is worth purchase price. Very solid app.
__label__1 Downloaded this app to my android  phone, because this "Office Pro Calulator" works better than the basic one that came with it....It's handy because I need one all the time and to be able to carry it with me.....Plus, this calculator app switches to the
__label__1 Works great on multiple platforms -Galaxy Vibrant, ASUS T300.  Keep the virtual tape in memory, and the memory value even after closed.  Interface is simple, easy to read, and work in both any orientation.  The only basic calculator I need!
__label__1 I like this one a lot. many features or options for layout and viewing. The folks who want to export or keep results for an audit are unfairly rating this app. The vendor did not make it for that purpose. Tape is cleared automatically after max of 10 hou
__label__1 i prefer  having the ability to see if  i've  made a mistake  in my  number input.  this fits the bill NICELY!
__label__1 This is the goto calculator app for me and my wife. I use this app every day from shopping at the  super market to paying bills. I would highly recommend this app to anyone who needs a good calculator.
__label__1 I had the free version which is a very good app. Now it is ad free it is even better.
__label__1 I loved  this calculator app  simply because its visual - in that you can see your numbers as you enter them. in addition, it does differentiate  positive an d  negative with use of colors.  Very easy to use!
__label__1 This is very easy to understand and use.  Great app.  I highly recommend it for all ages and devices.  A++++++
__label__1 Love it. Tape feature is tops. Easy to use. Features a-plenty. This should be a native app. Good quality products like this one are worth paying for.Kindle Fire HD 8.9&#34;, Fire 7&#34;, DroidX
__label__1 This app is wonderful.  No troubles and does exactly what promised.  It's just like having a &#34;Hot Wizard&#34; over the &#34;Willard&#34;.  Seinfeld fans will understand.
__label__1 This app is well thought out with nice graphics and helpful tools. As a FAOTD,  it is definitely worth downloading.
__label__1 I got this app because I wanted a virtual tape calculator.I purchased the app to get the add free version.This is very good as a tape calculator. When doing financial or expense calculations, the tape helps to review and confirm entries. This makes it ea
__label__1 This is a great calculator for doing simple arithmetic, and the Virtual Tape is so useful.  I love how you can add text to entries in the tape, and the ability to go back and change an entry and have the totals adjust is a wonderful feature.But I wish th
__label__1 I have used calculators since 1977 or so.  I have always had one with me and this is the best I have tested for android.  I tried lots before this, but only 1 or 2 since, I don't think I can beat this one.  All basic functions right in front of me with a
__label__1 Great office calculator with a record. Comes in handy when doing checkbooks and monetary sums. I don't use it often, but it does capture the look and feel of a good old printing Canon calculator.
__label__1 Nice calculator, if you adjust the settings then you will have your own custom calculator the way you like it.
__label__1 This is an excellent tool!I find it very easy to read and very user friendly.This is convienient when computing discounts on sale items and calculating tips.
__label__1 While I love the tape feature, the %= feature is what separates this one from the pack. That simple function that makes all the difference for me.
__label__1 What more do you say, its facebook.  It works well as it should.  No real problems yet.  I like it.
__label__1 I've tried several free calculator offers and this one works great on my Kindle which I use to handle business on. What I like is that as you are adding there is a side bar that keeps tabs what you add or subtract and you don't have to wonder if you've a
__label__1 If you are not so number savy like me this is good to have. It really helps, it has every thing that a scientific calculator have but more, and even better it was free
__label__1 This has been a great calculator app. It works just like a &#34;regular&#34; calculator. The numbers & symbols are nice and big,  easy to use. Best of all the app was free
__label__1 I love this calculator. It is the clearest and easiest one that I have ever used on a hand held device.
__label__1 Yes, the tape makes this app. Not the one for geometry, but it says office calculator. Perfect for doing a little accounting homework without bringing a TI to class.
__label__1 I love this calculator! Works great on my Fire! Would recommend to anyone who wants a handy calculator to use.
__label__1 I looked at many of the calculators and was unable to make up my mind, then I went to my daughters over the week-end ( I bought heer a Kindle for her birthday),and low and behold she had found the perfect app so I down loaded it and very happy I did.
__label__1 This is a very handy / dandy little tool.  East to use, and definitely comes in handy.  I like having this on my tablet.
__label__1 This is a great app to have on your kindle.  You have everything you need at your fingertips and that's great.
__label__1 It's free and it works, enough said I guess.There are no bells and whistles, but what do you expect from a calculator app right? Everything on it works right and it's free and easy to use.Ruckischmuckle
__label__0 I wanted it in my tablet but I could not get it to go there, I don't need it in my deck top.
__label__1 Look no more, this will do for all the usual household math problems you might have. Large numbers for easy entry and it even gives a running tally. Pretty cool.
__label__1 Love this app!  Great virtual tape feature too :)  Easy to use display and adjustable settings (for example: decimal places)
__label__1 I'm sure it does what it does for free. I would rather recommend getting a $10 calculator that is good for statistics. Smartphones waste a lot of battery, and a solar calculator doesn't need batteries
__label__1 This calculator is very nice.  I especially like being able to see the running total when I'm doing long calculations from paper.  Would recommend as a free app.
__label__1 Works great on kindle fire. You never know when you might need a calculator and i can never seem to find one when i need one. Now I can use this app anytime! Download it, its free.
__label__1 Love using this.  Numbers are large enough that I can see them easily.  Helps when I balane my checkbook.  I do recommend this to others.  Does everything I want it to do.
__label__1 Very easy to use and nice to have a calculator so handy. Having it on my Kindle for easy access is great.
__label__1 This is a better calculator than stock.  That it is free is icing on the cake. Does what it says.
__label__1 This "Office Calculator" app provides basic calculation functionality, including Addition (+), Subtraction (-), Multiplication (x), Division (/), and Percentage (%=), as well as a Memory Function (single entry). The best part is the "Tape" feature that w

__label__1 I like this feature, doesn't work unless you have wifi. I would like it to work all the time. I want to use it in the store.

__label__1 After trying several other &quot;calculator&quot; apps, I decided to try the free version of Office Calculator. I've been using it for several months now and I'm no longer looking for anything else. Office Calculator does everything I need. It's flexible
__label__1 Easy to use. Has good memory to handle hewvy calculations. Has a lot of good features for all your calculation needs. It was Free.
__label__1 This is the BEST calculator that I have ever found. Since I use it on my Android tablet more, I found in the Settings that this can be changed to landscape mode (it starts off in portrait). And there are other settings that can be changed.My favorite thi
__label__1 I got this calculator for my Kindle Fire. I don't use it often but when I do, I like it. I messed around with it trying out different settings and colors. I put the Keypad Layout as EXTRA BIG PLUS BUTTON - that is what we use the most and that is a prett
__label__1 I love the functions of this calculator.  I especially like the way it shows your calculations like it is running a tape.  I would definitely buy this again.
__label__1 this is the easiest simplest office calculator I've used in a long time. I highly recommend it to everyone who owns a Kindle.
__label__1 All 5's without a doubt. It is the best calculator I have ever owned. It is easy to use and see. It does the job for me.
__label__1 Any calculator I use must have the +/- key and this met my #2 criteria; 1st criteria is that it was free.  Having tried it, I have to say I really love the tape feature so I can review different options without having to write everything down.
__label__1 I love this calculator.  Its like have a 10 key machine, only without the paper.  Great app to have one!
__label__1 Very nice and convenient, worked as expected, one of the better choices out there for an android calculator, also like Calcu a lot.
__label__1 I was very happy with the quality of this calculator.  I got it to help with my taxes, and it was far superior to any handheld I had used in the past.  I especially loved that was that it offered a choice to &#34;print&#34; the data entries on the screen
__label__1 I use this on a near daily basis. In the grocery store, when calculating my own gauge for knitting patterns, and lots more.
__label__1 I use the calculator for everything, adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing.  Works great.  It is very easy to use, the numbers are a great size. I would recommend this free app to anyone who needs a calculator.
__label__1 This was a free app that I downloaded for my Kindle Fire HD. In spite of my education, my math SUCKS! I needed something on my Fire that helped me quickly do math without bleeding from the eyes, nose, and ears!! This did the trick-for what I needed. It h
__label__1 This product is a blessing when I'm working on my budget. It saves a lot of time and aggravation. I find it only as accurate as what you put in. i have at times got flustered only to find it my fault
__label__1 I like this calculator because it lists your calculations vertically so if your doing a lot of adding or something you can see where a mistake was made and go back and check your work.
__label__1 why don't. all calculators come with this tape... what an excellent idea simple yet practicall. this is an ad supported version but I don't mind.  5 stars.
__label__1 It is just what it claims to be--a caculator.  It is handy to have and works well.  It should be standard on the kindle or any tablet computer.
__label__0 You cant do anything here, just add and subtract, nothing else.Don't don't don't buy I said don't buy this dont&iexcl;!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&iexcl;
__label__1 It's a free app for the kindle fire, it has come in handy many times. Has many functions and very readable.

__label__1 I found this a nice app and tried several.  This one is more detailed to all the things I want a calculator to do
__label__1 Office Calculator (free version) is a basic four-function calculator than runs well on my Kindle Fire. It's a good calculator for the basic functions: add, subtract, multiply, divide,, and percentage. It has a memory register to store one number. The vir
__label__1 All the basics calulator functions are here in this excellent little app and it's free.  If you need SIN or COS and other scientific notations, then this is not the caluclator for you.  If you need just the basics like memory keys, percentage key and a v
__label__1 I love having a calculator for my Kindle Fire.  This one works extremely well.  Couldn't be happier with this purchase.
__label__1 Why would anyone give this one star?  I mean it is a calculater and whoever wrote the report saying &quot;it is only a calculator &quot; duh!!!!!!  or else it wouldn't say &quot;CALCULATOR &quot; geez!!!!!!!!!!!!!
__label__1 This feature has many different uses. It is very easy to use and functions just as expected. Would recommend to others
__label__1 Everyone needsa calculator at one time or another. So convenient to have one handy at all time.  I love it.
__label__1 This is a no-frills app that simulates a standard office desk calculator. Works nicely on my Kindle Fire with no loading or freezing issues. The keys are sized appropriately so you can work quickly. With some other apps I tried, the keys were too narrow 
__label__1 this is the best calculator for my homework at Thomas Jefferson classical academy. I love it you should get this app it is very helpful and free :)
__label__1 GLAD TO KEEP ON THE SYSTEM. I USE IT ALL THE TIME AND I AM GLAD TO FIND IT LOOKS LIKE THE REAL TING AND GIVES ME A TICKET LIKE RECIEPT.
__label__1 This calculator is easy to use and gets tons of use on my kindle. I no longer need a separate calculator
__label__1 Having a bookkeeping background, I really like to see what my numbers are and review my tapes.  This calculator has it all and I highly recommend if you like to recall (review) your numbers.
__label__1 So much better than another calculator app I tried.  Like that it shows you the numbers you've previously entered, it helps you keep track of things so you don't muss anything or add something twice.
__label__1 Yep, nice big buttons and easy to use. Tape feature is great! I should buy the upgrade as I have no choice on where the decimal is or even if I want to use it. But that's okay, I'll just ignore it for now.
__label__1 I use this app in my phone and other tablet, I like it cause it has memory like regular calculators.
__label__1 Easy to work and has the additional functions I need. It emulates the more expensive calculators, and does so without carrying additional hardware.
__label__1 I have found this to be a necessary addition to the Kindle. Large easy to read display makes it easy to do simple math problems whenever the need arises.
__label__1 There are times you just need a calculator. So purchasing this just made sence. I have my fire with me all the time and now I have the calculator too. works wonderful!
__label__1 Essential to have on my Kindle Fire; practical and handy. Glad I have it on my Kindle Fire - It helps to have it.
__label__1 This works like a finance calculator with streaming tape etc. It does a lot of complex operations and has come in handy.
__label__1 I really enjoy that this calculator keeps track of the numbers you've entered. It keeps it listed for you, so you can see if you entered in anything wrong. It keeps me from having to enter everything in a couple times for verification. Very nice.
__label__1 Clear, simple calculator.I love the tape, which provides a quick record of the numbers I used in my calculations.Highly recommended.
__label__0 it gives me the wrong answersand the keys are to small it is a waist of time and space
__label__1 I'm in 5th grade and this calculator is awesome for checking my homework. It doesn't do anything complicated like fractions but does most basic things that is a real help on my Kindle. There's a fee ads but you'll look over it after a while
__label__1 I use this app on my Kindle. It works great and I'm glad to have it. I had an other one but it was making errors. It was not as exact.
__label__1 Loved this app.  The numbers are large enough to actually see them and the keyboard isn't tiny like my cell phone so I'm really pleased with it.
__label__1 works perfect for my algebra . . . . . . . . . . .. . . . . . . . . . .  . . .
__label__1 This is a wonderful, easy to use "adding machine" type of calculator. This app makes it easy to do expense reports, or anything that you need to do a large number of calculations. It also makes it easy to spot errors with the way the numerical entry is l
__label__1 Despite what others have said, the app is exactly as pictured and all required keys are present. I don't like the decimal added for me and it took a minute to find the right setting to turn that off, but after it's set it's perfect. The tape will be very
__label__1 I love this calculator. its simple,  unlike other calculators. you can easily find a mean of a problem beacause it records your answers. you don't have to be like,  awe man what was that answer again. and best of all,  its free! I don't know about you,  
__label__1 evryone needs a calculator dont they? well no mttr where i go i lik to hav one it helps wit the easiest thngs to the hardest
__label__0 didn't like it at all. I only needed a simple calculator, too much going on with it....but it did look good.
__label__1 Offers way more that than what I use it for. Maybe one day I'll look into all the functions, but honestly, I probably won't.
__label__1 This app was indispensable for tax time. Works and looks great on the Kindle Fire. Love the &quot;adding machine tape&quot; feature which is super helpful in double checking long transactions. Very customizable.
__label__1 I don't use this too often, but glad to know I have it when needed and the price is right
__label__1 it does havve a multillyig. button it just isn't a x its a wise figure. and it is freest and very. useful.
__label__1 Great app! It does what it is suppose to do. Had not had any problems as of yet! Works well in every aspect especially when calculating annual percentage rates.
__label__1 I use mine all the time on my Kindle Fire. It is simple and easy to use. I have no complaints.
__label__1 First -It,s a calculator, it adds and subtracts, and does that very intuitively.I got exactly what I expected, for free!Displays very well on the Kindle Fire.I only have one suggestion, don't have the clear all function clear the stored memory (M+), ther
__label__1 The calculator on my Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 was terrible, this one is just what I wanted. Tape mode to track what you've entered.
__label__1 This is the best calculator I've found for my Kindle Fire. I also love that you don't need wifi to use it.
__label__1 For a tablet in business use you can't beat this app.  Easy to read, easy to use and being able to follow your keyed amounts is such a plus.
__label__1 I have no complaints.  i like that you can see your running tab.  it's accurate easy to use and easy to reset
__label__1 It's GET to have this one for it has percentage too. It's a great calculator.You sitting there & something pops into your head you want to buy & your calculator is there however you need to calculate your order.
__label__0 I didnt like this at all its not a basic calculator which is all i was looking for i just deleted it and will look for another calculator app at another time
__label__1 I downloaded this when my desk calculator decided to die while I was doing my taxes. It saved my sanity at the time and I continue to use it all the time. I have no intention of buying another desk calculator.  I use this one in the stores to compare pro
__label__1 Love having this app on my Kindle Fire. I have been using it to plan my wedding renewal ceremony. Excellent for calculating expenses. Easy to use.
__label__1 Great!!! I use this calculator 4 classes, my budget and just simple tasks.  I would recommed this apps 2 others.
__label__1 This is a convenient device that I would recommend to anybody who needs to perform mathematical calculations frequently.  The app is simple and does what it is supposed to do: solve math problems so you don't have to! It works perfectly fine and I have h
__label__1 Loaded on our Pandigital White Novel tablets and it works perfect. Giving a 5 since it works so well. Logging from one of the tablets.
__label__1 I only needed a simple calculator for every day use on my phone.  This one fits the bill perfectly.  I highly recommend it.
__label__1 The headline says it all...and it's quick, easy to use etc and portable, pretty much servest he same purpose as a desk calc
__label__0 Does not work as well as Google Maps
__label__0 poor App
__label__0 Very helpful
__label__1 MapQuest has been the best for fast and accurate directions, for all driving directions local and multi state distances. it is great for figuring distances and travel times. I have used MapQuest for many years.
__label__1 Just like on your PC, this gets the job done quickly and easily. Great app to have when in need of directions
__label__1 This app performs as promised. I use it from time to time to find my way around and it works.
__label__0 First the app couldnt find my current location it was 5 blocks off. my wifi is connected and I even zoomed in to my correct location with still no luck. I then 'toured' my city and yes the streets are numbered right but almost half the businesses were no
__label__0 kindle doesn't have the geo ability so this was a waste of an upload. if you did it on a phone - maybe it would be worth it.
__label__0 this program doesn't let you have a start place different from your current locale. and you need 3g because in order to use it you have to be connected.
__label__0 acquired it to help a friend but I only had my kindle at the time; application WAS AND IS NOT EASY TO USE ON KINDLE.  Was unable to use it as easily as I would using Mapquest on my computer.  It doesn't allow you to put in the starting address and the de
__label__1 I have always used Map Quest and will keep using it more now. It helps keep from getting stuck in traffic.
__label__1 I have used a lot of navigational aids and devices, and my job takes me into remote areas at times, and mapquest has only been wrong once or twice, which was not a problem, since only two roads were &#34;swapped&#34; and I quickly figured that out. These
__label__1 It does what it's supposed to do, easier to work with than Google maps. Great app for the android platform.
__label__1 It works on my Fire with a Mobile Hot Spot.  Just thought I would mention that.  I have it on my phone too.. so I hadn't tried it with the hot spot until I saw on here that people were saying it didn't work and that you needed 3G..
__label__1 The Fire is not intended for mapping and anyone that trashes this app because it doesn't work on a Fire is out of touch with reality. This app is solely and completely an alternative to Google Maps. It is not a replacement for Google Earth. While it will
__label__1 I really like this app.  Whenever I need a map, this is the app that I go to.  User friendly and seems accurate.
__label__0 I down loaded this and couldn't get this to work on the Kindle Fire.  I unloaded it from my Kindle.
__label__1 Good app.  Not the one we use all the time, but definitely worth the money and has been very efficient.
__label__1 Very useful.  It's nice to have it on my kindle fire when I don't have my computer handy, and I can do a quick check on places I may visit.
__label__0 I have been unable to get the app to work. Therefore, I am giving 1 star and reserving my right to move it up once it responds to m\e. Probably good, but not now.
__label__1 This is amazing and I don't have to refold a large sheet.  Thanks  We are learning how to use this device with a little help from our son.  thanks
__label__1 Love the app had to look up something for work while I was out with my Kindle Fire and it was great.
__label__1 I have only used it twice.  I don't travel that much.  My husband is a truck driver and he uses it constantly.
__label__1 Great site, I have used it for years and will continue to do so. Accurate, reliable and easy to use.
__label__0 Loaded it on but could not get it to work for Canadian locations. Never had any problems using mapquest on my desktop computer.
__label__0 What happened? The new version is not working. I use the android version for the kindle hd. I always used the prior version, now it's totally useless. Arbitrary destination selection choices, pointless layers, milky white or pale blue screens don't help.
__label__1 so cool u can see China and if there is wifi u can see where you are hi hi yea so?
__label__0 ok I'm not being rood or anything but this app is not the best map app ever is you want a good one get Google Earth so that's that!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
__label__0 I am not a fan of mapquest. I was once,but that was back in my crazy experimental days of the 90's. This app needs some serious TLC to get it on par with Google. Its free but so is Google maps. save yourself the hassle of filling up the flux capacitator 
__label__1 As someone who likes to know where they are and where they are going, and occasionally runs into detours, this app is great!  Very functional, and even tells you the best gas prices around when you are connected to a server.
__label__1 This is a great game for kids and adults. I could spend all day playing this game, honestly! I would recommend this to any Amazon customer looking to install a great game for anyone in their family. You will have a lot of fun playing this, I promise.
__label__1 It is exactly what I was looking for, but the downfall of it is that you must have a wireless hotspot for it to function at all times when being used as a GPS and Traffic surveillance while driving.
__label__1 The GPS & traffic MapQuest is fantastic.  It alerted me to road construction before I even got to it.  Easy to hear audio made following the directions easy as well.  I'm hard to impress and I fight to avoid techy stuff with a passion.  While the grandpa
__label__1 Such a procastinator...Love this bigtime, everytime I have hesitated lately on getting certain apps on my KF, I end up kicking myself for it. I have been reading a book lately that giving streets and cross streets all through it. MQ Inc. Thank you!!!
__label__1 GOOD FOR LOCAL AND FORGIAN TRAVEL, FOR STATE TO STATE TRAVEL AND LOCAL TRAVEL AS WELL, GOOD TO KEEP YOU FROM GETTING CAUGHT UP IN CAR ACCIDENTS, AND WILL PREVENT YOUR FROM BEING LATE FOR WORK BECAUSE YOU GOT CAUGHT UP IN WAITRING IN TRAFFIC BECAUSE YOU W
__label__1 Installed easily and works well. A nice addition to the kindle fire. The gas station feature alone is well worth installing this app.
__label__1 App works. Typical mapquest set up. Haven't had any problems with it. Use it on computer, iPhone, and kindle fire
__label__1 Great app! Can be used in place of a GPS if you have wireless access on the highway. Good detailed maps!
__label__1 My son install this app for me. I only used it once. It appears to be accurate. But I do not have much experience with it.
__label__1 I use this all of the time. it's very handy and easy to follow because it gives you step-by-step instructions
__label__1 As always, MapQuest gives good directions, and I use my Kindle now more than my small-screened phone that is named after fruit.  Worth the price&#8230;especially if you're lost and the Zombies are closing in...
__label__0 It will not work.  I planed to map out my trip, then be able to to refer to it as I traveled only to fine it did not work. So I hope you have a good memory for this one.
__label__0 MapQuest simply sucks in comparison to Google maps and Google Earth...MQ just can't match Google's investment in keeping it current and accurate.
__label__1 Has the information that I need when we travel.  Having Map Quest has made vacationing so much easier.  We never plan how we are getting to our destination. With the help of Map Quest, we are seeing scenery we haven't seen before.  It's great!
__label__1 This MapQuest app is very handy to have.  I can now readily access MapQuest without logging into my computer.  This app saves me time.
__label__1 A good thing to have as long as  you keep it updated.  It is a good thing if you are traveling.
__label__1 Watch out world, I might be at your house soon.  I can go any where now.  Pick a spot and head out.
__label__1 This is great for planning trips and finding places you are looking for.  I use it especially for finding lower price gas stations.
__label__1 This is a great app. It was one of the first apps I put on my Kindle Fire. Very easy to use and with very useful information. I love it.
__label__1 Use it all of the time.  Easy and so helpful.  Everyone should have this on any electronics they use. :)
__label__1 This is a good map app and very useful. Better than a lot of paid apps out there. Worth a look
__label__1 Obviously this APP is way better to have on your phone, unless you have a data plan for your kindle fire, if not, this APP is useless unless you print out directions.
__label__1 I got this app for my Kindle Fire and I love it.  It is quick and easy to get directions.  Just wish the Kindle Fire was 3G instead of WiFi.
__label__0 Woefully slow on my Kindle HD Fire. Interface was a little clunky, and I had issues navigating.  Bear in mind, these are only my opinions, but as a former fan of the web version (pre- Google maps), I was disappointed.
__label__1 Giving it five stars because it is the most accurate mapping system yet; I have tried other things but this is working out great for me.  Thanks, Debbie S.
__label__1 Since I am not a real literate computer user, it takes me a long time to get what I am looking for.  But it will great after I get it all figured ou.
__label__1 This free app has helped me so many times.  If I make the wrong turn it recalculates.  What I like about it, is that it talks you through the route!
__label__0 are u developers that blaitainly Stupid,,your pc version is great but this is a -25 on a scale of 1-10 not even worth 1star.
__label__1 Pretty neat little app for an old android tablet that didn't have a map capability on it. Took me a while to figure out the ins and outs of using it but once I got that done it works great. A good alternative to using the GPS unit in my truck should I ne
__label__0 It's been a long time since I took the time to review an app, but this dang thing has been so hard to use and gotten me lost so often, I just have to.  The original app was fine.  It's the devil updates.  Bye, Mapquest!
__label__1 Not that I have ever been lost but it is nice to know with very little effort I can find places and directions from where I am.
__label__1 If you used MapQuest on your desktop or laptop then you know how this app works. It is a good thing to have unless you have a GPS unit in your car.
__label__0 This Ap loaded to my Kindle Fire however could not be viewed. I then could not remove it. Anyone have advice on how to rid myself of this?
__label__1 I use this all the time when I travel so it make my trip so easy and more fun. wish I could print from my kindle fire
__label__1 I live in a tiny town in northern Arizona &amp; had to spend the past two weeks in Phoenix for job training. After spending the past 12 years in a rural area I am not used to driving in heavy traffic anymore &amp; was totally unfamiliar with Phoenix. I'v
__label__1 Great idea.  As long as you have to walk around with a GPS locator on your person for 'Big Brother' to find you whenever he wants to, you might as well get some personal use out of it.  Tracking devices are another good idea if you think it's necessary. 
__label__1 This app is SUPER!! It tells you everything and anything you want or need to know to get anywhere! Even has a GPS that gives you explicit directions. I'm soooo glad I have it. I used to get lost going around the corner. A must have for all people whether
__label__1 Went on a road trip to Oregon and needed to find a couple of places and it was great.  Popped it up on the screen and asked for directions and there they were.  It made our trip a lot less stressful.  Very easy to use.
__label__1 I am very pleased that this app works on my Android 2.2 tablet. No problems at all. Excellent!It works as well as on my desktop.
__label__1 This application loads quickly and has many features that I like.  I plan to do travelling this season and I know this will be useful.
__label__0 The Amazon experience was great as usual, but the product is horrible. It is a terrible map app.
__label__1 Kindlefire is packed with goodies ...this is one of them! Just wish one could use it off line :))  Great!
__label__1 Hey there how are you have Flappy wings PRO?i do you do.I'm Ethan Cline.i lllllllooooovvvvveeeee this game.1+1=21+2-?+?=?Have Flappy wings PRO
__label__1 Really quick 2 find directions ...etc.  Really convienent! Would recommend Mapquest on Kindles! Especially while traveling. Or just trying to find local businesses.
__label__1 We bought an i-pad mini today because google maps always crashed on me and we were planning a road trip across the country.  I could have just as easily downloaded this app for free and saved me a lot of money.  But then my son would not have had all tha
__label__1 Great app. The app supplies a person with up-to-date maps, excellent driving directions,  and does not use excessive space on the tablet.
__label__1 It's only 2MB so it runs fast and hasn't locked or crashed on me, and  you need Wi-Fi, 3G or 4G for directions.
__label__1 Worked without any glitches to date. Able to get all the information I need in the least amount of time.
__label__1 I don't have a GPS for my car. This app has come in handy several times. I just put in an address and it shows me the location. Love it!
__label__0 I couldn't get directions or buildings to pull up like I needed to so this app just didn't work on my Kindle the way it works on my desktop.
__label__0 What a worthless app. Navigating the site is more difficult than actually navigating to your actual destination. Being lost online simultaneously with not knowing how to get somewhere stinks.
__label__0 I am sure the product is very good, however, I never received it on my Kindle. This is the first time I have not received something I ordered.
__label__0 Without GPS I Couldn't get the app to do anything other than locate a single address. No driving directions between two points available through my wifi. I didn't need actual directions while driving. Just wanted to check distances/routes between two poi
__label__1 Sean Dugan is correct, this is a Must Have app :-). The app tested at 100%. It shows detail maps of where you want to go, it will spot: addresses, Food, gase, post office, coffee shops, the list goes on and on!. If your looking for it, this is a great wa
__label__1 I found this jewel just as the GPS in my auto needed to be upgraded with current information.  The GPS company wanted to charge me approx. $250 to upgrade my five year old system with new programming.  True, upgrading it would have given me new turn-by-t
__label__1 hope this continue to work on my kindle fire. I like the different features just wish I ccsn have continuous connection to the Internet with this wi fi  stuff.
__label__1 very accurate with trip maps and gas and food locationslooking forward to using it again for vacations.  Thank you
__label__1 I have this on my desk computer and just added it to my Kindle. I have some difficulty using it with a smaller screen so when I'm at home I can easily use it there.  I only put on the Kindle what I need. This app comes in handy away from home (Kindle).
__label__1 I like the MapQuest, GPS & Traffic because it shows the maps in good detail.  It makes it easy to find where I am at any time.
__label__1 I downloaded this to see what my area looks like and so far it has not dissapointed me. I like that I can zoom out when I want to. I have to get better at using my hand to zoom as sometimes I make it go too far from where I want to be and I am not as smo
__label__1 Yes, it requires that you be on Wifi, and if it can see other wifi signals, the Mapquest app determines your location.  Most other Kindle apps don't do this.Other than that its' an average app, but it's free, no harm in trying.
__label__1 This app. gets me to where i'm going in times of desperate need! It saved money by not requiring a gps tool.
__label__0 I don't really hate it.  Just haven't had the opportunity to use it yet.  I know it will be very useful.
__label__1 Installed it not knowing how it might work, played around with it for a few minutes, found a ton of information with this app.Try it, it's free, you'll enjoy it as I have.
__label__1 I chose to put this on my kindle because it is what I use at home on PC and at work.  I am familiar with the format and think it is the best that I have tried.
__label__1 Mapquest is better than google maps I live this app try it for your self.  You  won't be disappointed in.
__label__1 I installed MapQuest on my Android tablet, and took a trip across the state. It worked perfectly, giving verbal directions every step of the way, making the trip safe, and easy, and stress free. GREAT APP!
__label__0 It does not know where I live ! I put in the address and it thinks I am in a different location. I have WiFi and I think that is the problem. Maybe you will have better luck .
__label__0 This was very difficult to work with.  Could not seem to get accurate information but got a lot of information I didn't need or want.I'll stick with GPS
__label__1 I have a very simple phone so this is a great item to have on my Kindle Fire so that I can find directions to places I need to go.  I was in a restaurant when the delivery person was not there.  Someone needed find the directions to the location for a de
__label__1 I love the ease of using this app to figure out where I am and how to get to where I want to go.
__label__1 I like being able to plan my trips.  Knowing the routes keeps me focused and makes driving so much easier
__label__1 I was surprised at how easy MapQuest was to use. This application on my Kindle clearly and easily shows me the information I need to locate any address. The additional features help me plan not only my route but where to find services such as gas station
__label__1 Are family was going to church 4 hours and 17 min. away on Dec. the 30 but we got sick.  So I downloaded this app and I love it.  It shoes you how long it will take and it does not freeze up!  :)
__label__1 My husband was the one who downloaded this app and spent hours looking at the spot in Czechoslovakia where my daughter will be going to school for a semester.We were both impressed with the detail and quality of that detail MapQuest had.Four thumbs up!
__label__1 It is a good mapping program. The only difficulty is the lack of a GPS on my Kindle to get full use of the App
__label__1 What a novel idea. Haven't used it, but we go tooling in an RV and having more maps is great!
__label__1 I love this app. It made travel easier and my kids love to find our house on the map, or find a country's capital for school. It is very accurate and simple to use. Also, it has state-of-the-art graphics. It is AMAZING!!!
__label__1 I really like this app on my Kindle.  It's so handy when you don't want to be on you computer and need location information.
__label__1 I have this set to my local driving area, and I especially use the traffic updates on my tablet prior to leaving for work and on my return trip. I also use it during rush hour if I want to go shopping in order to avoid heavy traffic. Great app for many r
__label__1 Needed this for a long time. No more excuses for getting lost and being late to a friends house !!!!!
__label__1 nice app MapQuest, Inc. I love this app.recommend for all kindle fire owners.helps you find where you need to go to. GREAT GPS!!!!
__label__0 I had download this app over a month ago as I thought it would be usefull. I tried to us it today for the first time and it couldn't find the business I was trying to find. I put in Macco Paint & Body and it returned Mac Cosmetics. I guess comsetics coul
__label__0 I often find that MapQuest gives incorrect directions and/or street names.  I will stick with my other mapping/driving direction service (to which I am not mentioning because it would be advertising for someone else).  Use at your own descretion...
__label__0 I honestly don't understand why apps for windows tablets are so much worse than apps for apple products.  I have used MapQuest for years on desk top computers and have always been pleased with the results.  However, this app is too complicated and too sl
__label__1 I only partially check this APP out, I can tell already how helpful it would be for just about anyone.From travelers to delivery people. I look forward to enjoying this a long time.
__label__1 this is an essential app for me.  I do a lot of driving and exploring on my days off and I use it all the time.
__label__1 Plan on using this when traveling.  Have used MapQuest often from my desktop in preparation for trips.  Wish the Kindle had a GPS.
__label__1 WORKS JUST LIKE A MAP PROGRAM SHOULD VERY EASY TO USE AND NO ISSUES YET IM GLAD WE DOWNLOADED TO BOTH OF OUR ANDROID PHONES!!
__label__1 I like knowing where I am going and this app is extremely helpful.  The fact is has GPS is perfect.
__label__1 Like it!
__label__1 I like to use this app. I use the app often. It was a great buy. Very happy with my purchase. I would buy again.
__label__1 One night when my husband and I had left a friends home in the country, we turned on a wrong road. It is so easy to get disoriented out away from  the bright lights of the city. The moon wasn't even any help that night. He didn't have a compass in his tr
__label__1 I USE THIS APPLICATION TO GET INFORMATION ON WHERE I AM GOING & WHAT IS AVAILABLE IN THE AREA!THANK YOU FOR YOUR INFORMATION.
__label__1 Always nice to have a map handy.  Nice to be able to look at a place at the touch of a finger.  Added convenience.
__label__1 Thus application has very detailed maps.  Many landmarks and geological features are labeled.  Great for orientating in an unfamiliar area .  Thank you for offering it.
__label__1 Search with this AP is great.. I've only had to use it a couple of times, and then it was easy to use
__label__1 I have not used this app that much but can't wait until I need to use it and see how it works.  Will write a better review then.
__label__1 Same old MapQuest, if you need to find your way around, try this app, and you will be there in a flash.
__label__1 i like map quest shows me where i am going if i dont know the way just like on the computer it is easy
__label__1 always use it at home great to have else where. gives you all you need to know when traveling around
__label__0 And it won't erase from my kindles memory. It shows up whenever i run a malware ck, taking up valuable space! :-(
__label__0 Mapquest is owned by AOL and like all AOL products it lacks quality and proper customer support. Use Google Maps instead.
__label__1 I like it because it is so easy to find the places I want without becoming frustrated as I do with so many others
__label__1 Cool I am always getting lost so this can really help. I don't have to print up maps anymore. This is a great app.
__label__1 always nice to be able to access this feature as I am traveling more and more for my company. Thank you.
__label__0 App wouldn't work at all put in directions and it was so poor it wouldn't even load had to uninstall!!!!
__label__1 Everyone can use a mapping device every now and then.  This works if you are in an area with wifi.
__label__1 OK, I rarely use this app but it is reliable and a must. Unless you have to agree with your wife and 'stop and ask for directions' , especially where your not sure of the location or the area!!!  AND you don't want to be in that predicament to begin with
__label__1 I like this app as it gives a few different routes to choose from as to which is the shortest route to the longest route.  Also, on the route you choose, it shows options of places to stay, food, etc.  It has helped many times.
__label__1 A great replacement for my GPS. Simple and fast. I like the neat graphics and visuals. Clear and colorful, sharp details and accurate.
__label__1 Locating a Map Application that would work with our i10-50 Tablet was a deal-breaker for keeping the tablet.  This MapQuest app WORKED - even with the low Wi-Fi connectivity at our home.  We are still in the decision-making process with the tablet, so ha
__label__1 Who could live with out this one especially when your traveling. Love how is pin points all the coffee shops. A must!
__label__1 great for getting around.  Mapquest is a good source for getting around the city or if you are traveling you can use it to find your way.
__label__1 I really like mapquest; I've used it for several years now and it has NEVER failed me. I was tickled pink to see it available for my kindle fire HDX. It gives me a secure feeling when I am on the road.
__label__1 It gives me the information where I want it and the locations I want.  I am really happy with this app, and couldn't be happier.
__label__0 I Got this and never used it so it is hard for me to rate this app. I am glad it was free.
__label__1 i use this as map quest on the internet and i hope this work the same as the computer internet version
__label__1 thank you for  putting this in an  app so i can use it  on  my kindle. i know it will come in handy  when i am  on  the road.
__label__1 I have just began to use MapQuest on my kindle I have used it on my computer and think it is great. gives good directions and the GPS works wonderful
__label__1 found maps in one second. still needs a update, because google maps still is better. but i guess this map app is still fine
__label__0 This app didnt work, since it does have the right maps of Venezulea.Never found my location, so was never able to find directions.
__label__1 Had help from family on this app and am so happy to be able to get directions when I don't have computor access as I don't have a smart phone either.
__label__1 Same great service we expect from mapquest. I now have Mapquest on all our devices.I highly recommend this app to anyone needing &#34; direction&#34;..
__label__1 The first time I used it I was impressed.  Voice command is awesome.How can you go wrong with a great free app.,
__label__1 Great GPS and maps..I would recommend this to all my friends.I haven't put it to the test yet, but I've used it before an it worked out well.
__label__1 I use this app all the time even if someone gives me directions. I have used it with friends traveling. It isOften easier than a GPS.  It has been accurate every time.
__label__0 Okay so heres the deal what was the point to have this if my kidle fire only had wifi map wuest is to help you get places well if the road has no wifi it does not help me. Maybe with the new fires this would help but not the first Gen or the no wifi ones
__label__1 I love MapQuest, have used it for years on my PC and now on my tablet. Great information and easy to use. Thank you
__label__1 It usually gets you to where you are trying to go.  As with other MapQuest apps it sometimes comes up with strange ways to get there.
__label__1 Works well as I would expect it to
__label__0 wasn't  thrilled by it for navigation to begin with, but when i was trying to use it to help understand the news, Israel disappears after zooming once, and Jerusalem is missing.  Way to take sides in politics instead of showing facts.
__label__1 Great, but I really don't need it as I have a Magellin GPS, which I depend on enourmously.  BUT - I'm glad I have MapQuest, too.
__label__0 this product does not load properly and when it finally does...it does not work properly...i have removed and reinstalled to no avail!!!
__label__1 Mapquest is wonderful -- don't leave home without it!  It's fast, accurate, and helpful.  I use it often when I'm traveling - locally and on trips.  Keep up the updates coming.  Fantastic!
__label__1 I live in Australia and this app is very good,it is obviously not a GPS but is nice to have as GPS backup and handy for traveller research or trip planning.I can also see a benefit when I may walking in a strange city or town and am able to use my kindle
__label__1 It is very useful and helpedmy husband and I find our way around Prescott.  We used it to get to our granddaughters home and to our hotel.  IVIE Bellone
__label__1 It guided us around San Francisco streets, found restaurants in Santa Cruz and found faster routes to the freeway than we had taken before.  Lots of bells and whistles and great accuracy.
__label__1 You have to have internet connection to use it.  I have the location mapped in at home and then use it for just the map to get where I need to go.
__label__1 There are times when my GPS acts up, so I have to turn to the MapQuest app. I love it.I also like to use it to see the distance from where I am to where I think I want to go.
__label__1 I have used MapQuest for years on my computer. Now that I have it on my Kindle Fire it is a great asset when traveling for your every need.  We love our Garmin but I have always put great confidence in MapQuest. Great asset.
__label__1 This app works just like using MapQuest on your computer - very convenient and a must have for people constantly on the go
__label__1 I love this app it something good to have you don't need to ask any one where is this place you just take out you kindle and look up your place yourself .
__label__1 Plug in where you want to go and it gets you there quite nicely. I have given up on GPS's for travel with the advent of smart phones and now my Kindle. Very up to date and accurate.
__label__1 I installed it on a Kindle Fire HD with no problems.  The app is just like going to the website to me.  Very easy to use.
__label__1 I'm just a kid and when my dad is like &quot;ok I will take you to your friends house, but where is it&quot; I am like idk her address is blab blab blab and he has no clue where it is so instead of looking it up and printing It out everytime I just use t
__label__1 the voice directions are great when you are driving alone and can't take eyes off road to read a screen.
__label__0 Don't install this unless you want to share the information of ALL your contacts, which is a requirement of the application.
__label__1 works great for what I needed  it to  do  will use again and again. i will keep it  for my trips away home .
__label__1 I love  the mobility of using when I'm out and about and traveling.We will recommend it to a friend.Thank You!
__label__1 this application. I'm a die hard Mapquester and love this version. You can detour while en route and easy to use
__label__1 I like the way you can look up a map or directions when in WIFI range and it stays available after you leave.  I use it on my Kindle Fire when I work as a transporter, a job that frequently takes me to new places.
__label__1 When I ask a question, I want a direct answer. That's precisely what I get with this version of MapQuest; direct and simple information. I had given up on getting any useful directions on the internet; but remembering the old MapQuest, I tried again, and
__label__1 Product works well have it on my kindle and with it there is no need for a GPS -- making the gps obsolete..
__label__1 this app is great and very helpful. its like haveing a gps without the turn by turn guidince. the maps are great and you really can explore an area
__label__0 I tried to use the new mapquest. I added the lawyer for &#34;food&#34; for my part of town. I live in Alaska. I got to see restaurants just down the street from me, which were located in places like Richland WA and Monroe LA. I sent feedback:&#34;Discove
__label__1 this is a great help, when I'm researching a location or just planning a trip.  I've always used this for printing out directions
__label__1 this app is great for me and my business. it helps me find my clients with out any problems. thanks
__label__1 I downloaded MapQuest to my smart phone and began to use about 6 months ago.  The product is good but I still prefer Google maps.
__label__1 Mapquest works great for finding things, so long as you have a wifi connection.  However this is a limitation of the kindle, not the app.
__label__0 I am pretty certain that you have to be locked into WiFi for this to even work remotely well.And I am.And it doesn't work well.I like Google Earth the most. This would be cool - and work MUCH better if it was live on the Kindle Fire and not searching for
__label__1 This is a great app to have if you travel.  You can't beat a GPS when you're actually on the road but when it comes to planning a road trip it's great. You can view alternate routes and get an idea of how long your trip will take.
__label__1 Great app! Very easy to use and has come in handy more times than I can count. I love it!
__label__1 When I need to find a place to go, I use this app. So far it has beenVery accurate and reliable. No complaints what so ever.
__label__1 I was amazed at how easy it was to get directions and how much information was available.I usethis in all my travels now
__label__0 Mapquest never worked right, and don't they have fine print on all their maps that says they are not liable when their directions get you hopelessly lost? Seriously, look.
__label__1 I like it Ican chose to use it on my kindle instead of getting on my  computer the only down fall not able to print out the directions
__label__1 Not a gps but very handy.  I like being able to see how to get some where or give accurate direction.
__label__0 This App is nothing like the web based MapQuest.  Its hard as hell to find the button that will take you to &#34;get directions&#34; so you can enter your starting point, and then your end point.I DELETED IT.  IT WAS SOOOOOOO BAD.
__label__1 If you use Mapquest online for your pc....even better on your phone and since Apple blew it with their maps. This is the equivalent...even better.
__label__1 This works, especially I am not good when traveling to places I am not familiar with. I need precise directions to get where I am going in a timely manner
__label__1 I have used the Google map program on the web for years and have watched it develop from a sometimes useful program to a source of first resort for information on the location of just about any home or business.  The MapQuest app offers that capability a
__label__1 I am an animal rescue and often have to give directions to my rescue from places I am not  familiar and have been able with MAPQUEST to give easy direct routing thanks to MAPQUEST. GREAT!
__label__1 This is a great tool to find places, estimate travel times, etc.  I use it on my home computer as well.
__label__1 Love it.  Glad to have this app. x x x x x x x x x x x x x x
__label__1 Easy to use, this app makes getting around simple and quick (especially for the direction-impaired).  Since I travel often to different cities, this app comes in handy, acclimating me quickly to wherever I happen to be; especially if I have to walk anywh
__label__0 Whenever I typed in directions on mapquest.com, the directions that they given were not very accurate and they also did not listed side roads.  Google Maps is better!
__label__1 After download to Fire, I turned on and there was a little car at my house.  Just like a paid for GPS.  Got map on several locations.  When off like the map is still there. Love it.
__label__1 This program works the best for me.  Its clear and easy to read.  I wish I could use my kindle in the car!
__label__1 Great help for you when your in unfamiliar territory, I have resorted to this a couple of times. Thank you
__label__1 It is a great map app for Kindle, use it frequently, no problems on my new Kindle, it's a keeper
__label__1 It's just mapquest, lol.But I haven't found any kind of digital mapping system that works really well in the Hampton Roads area of Virginia.  This one is really no exception.  You just have to look at the map and figure out how to get where you are going
__label__1 I love the way it is so accurate in locating your position and showing very clearly the routes available to get to your destination.
__label__0 I needed to get direction and mileage for vacation. I could not get either one. Had to get a different web site from my son.
__label__0 I deleted this app since it gives the wrong location when I put in our address.Instead I go to google maps using the silk browser.
__label__1 I like this app a lot. Not sure why there are so many low reviews. I don't expect much when my device is wifi only with no gps. So basically this is still a great tool for planning trips at home before I leave. And maybe there's not a ton of offline opti
__label__1 This is better than any paper map because it has up to date streets and subdivisions.  Great for garage saling.
__label__1 This was downloaded to my Kindle, and even seemed to act like my Kindle had a WI FI  and GPs to follow the pickup  and show  maps as I walked down the street!  I must have been picking up from houses I was passing!  ??
__label__0 Not as good as google maps, runs much slower and graphics less refined even on a tablet, not sure why anyone would use this unless they didn't have a choice (I'm looking at you kindle fire)
__label__1 I use this on my Kindle Fire. I'm not always on Wi-Fi, but when I can connect this app has a lot of info. available, especially for being a free app..I would recommend this to anyone.
__label__0 Downloaded this free app, went to look for it in app library and it wasn't there.  Went back to re-download it again and was told it was already in my app library.  Again I go to look for it, and no Mapquest App..As the kids like to say... FAIL!
__label__1 so great when local or traveling-it is simply great-whether driving or traveling by train or plane, this is the item to have with you
__label__1 This application is very similar to the Web site.  It is easy to use.  This app would be helpful to anyone who needs to find an address.
__label__1 Very informative  like that I can get map quest . On my kindle makes it convenient so I don't always have to . Use my phone would recomend to everyone
__label__1 Have always loved mapquest but now love that I have it on my Kindle. Everyone needs this app, execially when traveling
__label__1 it worked great. did not stop cooperating it worked really really great for me to everyone that is thinking about getting it it is great
__label__0 this app was a waste of time unable to get maps to where I need to travel. Deleted it as fast as I downloaded it could never get directions from Georgia to Phoenix&#60; AZ
__label__1 I downloaded this app while I was lost in PA.  Within minutes I was up and running and in a stressful situation found my destination and a path to reach it.  You know an app is great when you use it in a panic and it helps.
__label__1 Not as many features as Google maps but it still get the job done. What makes this great though is that it seems to be more accurate then Google Maps and it is only 2MB so it runs fast, rock solid and hasn't locked or crashed on me yet. Wonderful app!
__label__1 I am a truck driver and this helps out in planning this app works wonderfully. This has turned into one of my favorite tools
__label__1 As long as you got internet connection to use with it it is somewhat useless. But I like that I can pull up last saved map without being online.
__label__0 The gps part is not working. It keeps saying can't find your location. I just wished it would have worked.
__label__1 This is a great app if you need direction. It is precise and fast. I would recommend the app. Thanks.
__label__0 I didn't like this app because I wanted to be able to print the directions from my kindle. I couldn't find a way to do that so that's why I didn't like it.
__label__1 I have only had this app a couple of days so far but looks good.  I tried it on a simple test to a store in town and it plotted the course perfectly and quickly.  Using on Kinkle Fire HD don't know how it will work in car with no wifi available I'll have
__label__1 It is perfect for what I need.  I do a lot of searching and I use this almost every day.
__label__1 It put me right where I wanted to be, with miles to destination. Better than my TOM TOM, and no cost to me.
__label__1 I love this app. I have maps of everywhere I want to go; can get directions step by step; can find local restaurants; and all of this while traveling. I have used MapQuest for years, but always from home which meant I had to print out my map and directio
__label__1 A great app to have, although if its on your kindle, like mine, you have to go where there is wifi to use it lol Still nice to have on hand.
__label__1 I would think thatmost people know the computer version of this program & if you like that this is a must, pity that the Kindle has no GPS though so it dosen't work 100%
__label__1 love this app!!! have it for the kindle fire, works great! obviously not ALL features work, that would need mic 3g or cell signal and stanndered aneroid but it is still a great app.
__label__1 I now have a navigation system that works through my Kindle without paying a fortune to have this added to my vehicles. I have the application with me in whatever car I am driving.
__label__1 I wanted a map that doesn't require GPS, since my Kindle Fire HD doesn't have that.  This somehow figures out you location using other methods, and will plot a course for you.  Exactly what I was looking for.  Well done MapQuest.
__label__1 This will be very good on trips and that is the very reason I got it on mt tablet. thanks
__label__1 My five year old is learning to play chess, so I downloaded this and have been blown away by its design and features. As well as basic options like playing against another human or an android, you can choose to flip the screen between turns or to keep th
__label__0 More junk! What is the point of single player chess? Where is the multiplayer? Why would anyone want a single player chess game?
__label__1 Admitted, this is only the fourth free chess app I tested but the other ones either had a tendency to make huge blunders even at higher levels or weaknesses either in opening or endgame.Not this one.There aren't many &quot;creature comfort &quot; feature
__label__1 I write a lot of list. things pop in my head and I have to write them down immediately or I'll forget. this app is awesome! I can type them so I can read my own writing and no more little bits of paper everywhere! gift ideas to groceries to things that n
__label__1 An excellent list keeping and organization app.  I love the ability to add reminders and separate based on categories.  Not bad for a free app.
__label__1 This is marvelous.  Easy to use, syncs to my PC.  Available thru the cloud.  Reminders and such.  I don't really like todo lists but this one works well.
__label__1 Free, easy to learn, customizable, and syncs to all platforms...hands down the best of its kind. If you're looking for a to-do list w/multiple lists, reminders, and the option to upgrade for sharing options, look no further.
__label__1 I downloaded it on my EFun Nextbook and it works great and is very easy to use.  You can even get reminders in you email.I recommend this app.
__label__1 I've tried some of the best selling To-Do apps and none have been as easy to use as this one. In addition to the ease of use, I can program sub-tasks, set due dates and set reminders. There's even a space to type notes under each to-do item. Overall, it'
__label__1 I love Wunderlist. It's not too complicated and has a clean design. Its easy to use too.I wanted a simple list app and this is it.
__label__1 This is amazing. You can make lists and organize them neatly and quickly. I also like the fact that you can connect it with your facebook or tootle account. This is a great app overall. I really recommend it to anyone who is looking for a good notetaking
__label__1 This app works great! I use yahoo whereas the other apps want to use Gmail or only works on phones. This app works great on my Kindle Fire HD. I set a reminder, and on the specified time and date, an email is sent as a reminder to my Yahoo account, which
__label__1 I really love this app. I had Astrid before this & it was a good app but this one is ten times better. You get to set the background pic of your inbox, there is an additional note pad area for extra note-taking, & you can set reminders for specific tasks
__label__1 I have several list/note apps, and this is my favorite. Making all the different categories,I need, is so easy. My ONLY problem is forgetting to use it! I really like my &quot;notebook&quot; app, but I find when I want to enter anything quickly, this wor
__label__1 This is the most useful types of To Do Lists, Grocery List, Task List that I have found. It is great because it emails to myself or others like a memo that does it all, you know like a handy Swiss Army Knife. This app does it all as far as keeping one or
__label__1 I have been trying to find a to do list type app for the longest that really fit my needs. I have downloaded and removed several trying to find the best one. I've finally did with wunderlist. Not only does it sync across devises but i can make sub-lists 
__label__1 It's free, functional, and works really well, with companion apps on pretty much every platform so my tasks are accessible on whatever device I'm using. One of the main reasons I switched from using Google Tasks.
__label__0 Not useful or helpful.  Left a lot of stuff on my computer when I downloaded it. Not recommended at all.
__label__1 I got this app because it would sync across all my devices and it does so seamlessly. My MacBook Air, iPhone 5, and Kindle Fire HD all synced without a problem. I found the ability to set alerts and make folders and sub-folders very useful and the use of
__label__1 I have read the descriptions on all the list managers, downloaded and tried Wunderlist and MLO, and selected Wunderlist as my list manager.  It has a few more options and a few more capabilities than MLO.  It certainly has more than I need and now I read
__label__1 How many ways can I say I love this app. It has transformed my organizational skills. It is simple to use yet amazingly useful. I love that I have full control of content. I enter my own choice of names for folders. I can set reminders and add notes. It 
__label__1 The best way to keep, share and schedule tasks.  Organized by group and calendar sensitive to do lists across all platforms.  Handy.
__label__0 While I could set the the task on the calendar, I could not figure out how to set a notification for the task.  Would not recommend.
__label__0 So how does the app work? Where are any instructions.  Load the app in your Kindle and you can spend the next 8 hours trying to make it work. Very frustrating. Not straightforward. Maybe the instructions are hidden somewhere.
__label__1 I really like the ease of making up different lists in this app. Easy to mark things off as they are completed and you can either delete them entirely or leave them to recall what you did.  I highly recommend this app for those who need to keep track of 
__label__1 This is the best list making app. A few sync errors with repeating due dates only with my android phone, LG optimus L9 and the kindle fire. It only does it with repeating due dates that are daily. Other than that it is perfect, and I've tried out lots of
__label__1 I needed a task manager that worked across a Macbook, my Kindle, and a Samsung phone.  Wunderlist does it without fail.  Highly recommend.
__label__1 This is my favorite of the many many apps I have used to try to digitize my many temporary and recurring lists. I use this for so much more than just to-dos.
__label__1 Despite the name Wunderlist is more a task/to do app than a list/note app, although you can certainly use it to track your notes too. It offers GTD type functionality and includes Inbox, Starred, Today, Week, All, and Completed categories, although these
__label__1 I really like this app! Im able to sync lists on my Android phone, PC, and Amazon Kindle Fire.Its helping me on a daily basis at work and at home!
__label__1 I love this app! It is easy to use and just what I needed...I would do the same thing on paper all the time, this is way better.
__label__1 Wunderlist is such a great app! I use it everyday. From shopping to work to things around the house. This app totally deserves 5 stars. :)
__label__1 I used to use Any-Do for my agenda, but due to its lack of a desktop app i have stop.  Wunderlist is the ultimate agenda.  It works seamlessly with multiple platforms and is now the only app i use to keep track of school and work.
__label__1 This is an amazing app!  I have downloaded many to do list apps and have deleted every one, except this one!  I love that I can have this on all my devices (kindle, samsung galaxy phone, and PC).  No matter where I am I can see what needs to be done.  Th
__label__1 I like this product. The more I use it the better I like it. I have it on a Kindle Fire HD and on my Windows pc. They keep in sync very well. I think it would also be a great app on a smart phone, but I don't have one.
__label__1 I was apprehensive about this app, but that disappeared when I found how simple it was to load on my PC. my Kindle, and my iPhone. All three were synced as easy as can be. Very flexible and I probably will find it more and more useful as I get in the hab
__label__1 I use Wunderlist ALL the time.  It's a great app.  Easy to use and full of functionality.  If you use lists for anything, download it now.
__label__1 I like writing a shopping list and being able to complete a shopping list on my Kindle is really great.  I am also able to email this shopping list to my finance and she can update the information.  Those chances made will update on my wunderlist program
__label__1 I love this program. It allows me to sync my laptop to-do lists with my kindle so I have them when I'm out and about or don't want to get on my laptop. It's a great way to keep myself organized and knowing whats due when.
__label__1 wish I could give it more than 5 stars needs about 100 of them...love this app, you can add to your list from any device and let others do also...
__label__1 Now if only I could get it on my husband's older windows phone life would be perfect!  I have LOVED the sync features and have found that I no longer use many of my apps I previously loved and would prefer to just use this one for everything.  Flexible a
__label__1 I wanted a simple to do list for my Kindle and this is just what I wanted. Nothing unnecessary, just an easy way to make lists.
__label__1 yeah--you know it--fun just to sit and pop the bubble wrap and kill some time and stress relief...even makes a sweet bubble pop noise when you pop the bubbles...do a sheet--scoot to the next one or just shake the mobile or tablet and it resets...have fun
__label__0 maybe you people like it, but I don't. I got bored of it after a two minutes. I do not suggest this app. its boring.
__label__1 Very awesome. I keep it on my phone for a stress reliever. It let's you relax and get some frustration out. Love it!!!!
__label__0 really buy this app if you want to waste 10 min of your time tapping your screen 750 times a total waste of space on my kindle. REALLY boring
__label__1 Got this when I was going to visit my grandma because she loves popping the bubble wrap. She laughed the whole time. Had a little girl at church who was fussing and she enjoyed it a lot, especially when she could just run her finger across and pop a whol
__label__0 I wanted to get an app that was like popping bubble wrap...This is like popping bubble wrap but you can't do anything other than pop each individual bubble and you have to scroll to pop the whole sheet and you can't zoom out or in or open an new sheet of
__label__1 This reader is excellent! I needed one that would read .mobi files so I decided to try this one and I have never been happier. Handles .epubs, .mobis, .pdfs, .html (including .css), and so much more. Easily imports all the books I can put on my tablet. S
__label__1 Don't know how I got along with out it......So glad I have it now. I recommend it to every one.
__label__1 Love the features in this app. Being an avid reader it really helps pass the time while waiting on appointments Etc. I can have an entire library on the go.
__label__1 I was extremely disappointing with the lack of e-readers on the android side of devices. Coming from the iPhone where there were so many at so many different price points, Android just sucked.I found Moon Reader Free and tried it out. I was impressed eno
__label__1 Unfortunately, I really can't rate the Pro version as it is not am Amazon approved app for the Kindle Fire.  Amazon is so restrictive when it comes to the Kindle.  That sucks!  I will never purchase an Amazon hardware product again!  In this case, Amazon
__label__1 I was originally drawn to Moon+ because it offered the ability to lock your screen AND control pages with the dpad, while still offering limitless visual control options.  I've been ereading for a decade now, and I have a certain way I like things.  Moon
__label__0 This is another app that I Can't use on my Kindle Fire HDX, costing me $$$ again. How come Amazon sells digital books and apps that are NON Compatible? I tried to download this app onto my phone, LG G2 but it tried charging me another $4.99. Amazon takes
__label__1 This is the ONE!  I wanted a EPUB reader that I could highlight, enter notes, underline text.  This is my dream player.  It has replaced the FB Reader and Aldiko readers.  I like it better than Adobe reader.
__label__1 Not much I can say other than it can read everything I throw at it, and it renders everything smoothly and beautifully.This is the only app I have ever purchased, and I've been using android for five or six years.Thank you!
__label__1 No need to buy an audio book.  this one reads epubs to you while driving!  I recommend the free text to speech app called IVONA to go along with this.  Set it up on your android and it sounds more natural.  Still somewhat mono-tonic, but very acceptable!
__label__1 It is easy to use and a good epub would reccomend it to any one . it is  Fast and easy to use.
__label__1 get this to go on my pandigital to read my book to me . works great . kind of the same form as the kindle 3 wifi does . love it .
__label__1 But if you could get over that, this is a very fun puzzle game that will really give your brain a jolt.
__label__1 I found this because I liked the crosswords by Teazel and wanted to see what else they had. This type of game is new to me but after just a couple of puzzles in the free version I was hooked and had to buy the full game. No glitches so far. Keep up the g
__label__1 This game plays just like the codeword games in the puzzle magazines. The games are challenging but possible. A great way to exercise your brain!
__label__1 This is one of the nicest codewords puzzle apps that I've tried.  It has a very intuitive interface and a good help system.
__label__1 Excellent word puzzler!  The puzzles do get harder, which is good.  I do wish you could enter letters from the display of remaining letters, in addition to the keyboard below it.
__label__1 Deciphering the words with no clues is very relaxing for me.  It makes me think with no pressure.  And it is not timed.  Try it.
__label__1 I enjoy playing Codewords. Being able to check my work without seeing the answers is a very helpful feature, and the puzzles are challenging without being too difficult. Definitely worth the $1.99!
__label__1 I have always enjoyed the codewords game from the puzzle magazines and this is a very good app that plays just as easily as I have always enjoyed the game before.I would recommend it to puzzle lover's.
__label__1 Teasel has fast become my favourite word game app developer. This one is fun. Unlike some others, it gives true codewords puzzles where all the letters are used. You get quite a lot of puzzles for free, too. My one complaint would be that the format is a
__label__0 I found the UI so irritating I was unable to use the program. Numbers and letters are the same size and brightness. Full keyboard pops up and pushes word grid off the screen. Another reviewer said they got used to it and I wish I could because I love cod
__label__1 While I have only played 3 games so far, it has been fun and I caught on quickly. I. didn't invest in the full version, but I probably will. No glitches so far and no logging in-yay!
__label__1 I love having Codewords on the go. It is easier than carrying the book around. And the different levels of difficulty makes it a great app
__label__1 totally addicting much more fun than traditional crosswords download this one now! you won't regret it. only game you'll play
__label__1 I have really enjoyed this app. It is a great way to get your brain in gear and it is fun.
__label__1 This game is great for warming up the old noggin.  It really keeps you thinking on top of being extremely user friendly.
__label__1 This is a really fun app. I'm a sucker for word puzzles and these are really fun and challenging. I can sit and play it for hours and not get bored.
__label__1 At first it took me awhile to solve the puzzle, but now I can't put it down. I would recommend this app to my friends.
__label__1 this is an awesome game. thank you for helping me have a fun day. its like playing chess with words.
__label__1 I just recently started playing this type of game and have tried almost every one in app land but this one is by far the best one, hands down. I love how this company has the &quot;Lite&quot; versions for free. Even though it's free, there are so many pu
__label__1 Acer Iconia A500 w/ ICS. If you like codeword puzzles, this is the game for you. No fancy graphics, just efficient and well thought out. nice interface also.  No problem loading or playing - also did well on 3.2 before the ICS upgrade.
__label__1 Codewords Lite is a great game to make you think! My friend is always stealing my Fire to play this game. The game can be played with hints or without, so you can set your own level of assistance, giving you much more control over the game. It's a fun wa
__label__1 this is a very addictive game loads of fun and time consuming I hope you will enjoy this as much as I have
__label__1 I really like all the different options this app gives. You can really challenge yourself, or just relax with the easier puzzles. Either way, it's entertaining.
__label__1 shouldn't have to use a specific amounts of words - love sudoku - interesting game, easy to navigate app - fun
__label__1 I have always loved suduko and my son got this app for my kindle-fire.  I'm addicted!  The feature I like best is the option to occasionally check to see if I have any mistakes:)
__label__1 This game is set apart from other Sudoku games in that you can click on any number on the grid and it will highlight all of those digits already present in the grid, making finishing a single number easier.  Other than that, it is just a well rounded gam
__label__1 I like the option for adding possible solutions.  The 'check' feature makes it easy to see where you stand at any time.
__label__1 This is one of the best android games I have on my phone, easy to understand and to learn to use this program
__label__1 There are like 5 or 6 different modes of gameplay (regular sudoku, color sudoku, etc), plus 3 or 4 different difficulty levels. For each mode+difficulty combination, there are 100 puzzles. You do the math on how long this will keep you occupied. The inte
__label__1 We play this game every day and enjoy it so much.  It works fine on our Kindle Fire.  This was a good purchase. It is a fun game.
__label__1 I love this Sudoku Game, it's quite easy on all levels except the last one which is pretty hard. The marks system is not very good but I never use it so it doesn't reallty matter.
__label__1 It's never boring.  I have it on my phone, and on my tablet. It's good for my brain, I believe.
__label__1 I love sudoku puzzles and so I have really enjoyed playing this. I would recommend it to others who enjoy these kind of puzzles.
__label__1 This can be sed whether you are on or off line. Helps when those word games get frustrating. Gives you word game solutions if you want. I just love it.
__label__1 I really enjoy word games.  They can be relaxing as well as stimulating to your mind.  I would recommend it for anyone who likes to play with words.
__label__1 was skeptical at first at how well this app would perform but it does what it says it will an quite well too.
__label__1 This is something that my nephew downloaded and he played it the whole time we were camping. It was a little challenging for him though.
__label__1 It literally took just a few minutes to decide I wanted the paid app.  To see why, look at my review of the paid app.  This is perhaps the best app of its type.  It is far, far more than a typical word generator, app, or whatever you call it.
__label__1 This game is mentaly challenging and helps to keep me on my toes. I'm able to learn new words from playing it!
__label__0 not the game i was hoping for and cant figure it out it is like a dictionary i guess but still dont know what to do with it
__label__1 I love this game, play it every day, it helps me to learn new words to expand my vocabulary. Highly recommend this product to those trying to expand their vocabulary.
__label__0 This game is more complicated than I want to spend time solving. Prefer games that are relaxing and don't require much brain power.
__label__1 EVO 3d works fine. nice pictures and interface. basic game for basic skills.Please do not rate badly because Amazon won't do their updates. It is free today and the update will come. Take deep breath, be calm. :-)
__label__0 But my (non-reading) two year old was forced out of play into the appstore because of a request for rating that popped up during play.  This could have resulted in loads of mayhem if she were unattended!  I hope the developer will also make the play butt
__label__1 My kids love it, its a great way for them to practice counting and there abc, also love the lock feature, so they can't close the app
__label__0 Don't play any games on my phone and this was a free app. I never installed it so can't stay if I would've like it.
__label__1 I have an asus trnasformer tablet. Works perfectly! The young ones will love this! It will keep them occupied while learning.
__label__1 I purchased the app after reading the reviews.  I have the kindel fire and it works fine.  Pictures are large and I have purchased many apps for my grandchild to play.  She didn't have a connect by letters or numbers.  I like for her to have a variety of
__label__1 Great at occupying the kids. My kids love this application, and the special edition Xmas one. Aside from keeping them busy, is a great way to expand their numeracy. Keep the kids amused and learning at the same time. Works great on my Galaxy Tab.
__label__1 This is a child's connect the dots game. It features over 90 images and you can select either numbers for counting or the alphabet in either lower case or uppercase letters. Unfortunately connecting the dots draws shapes that even an adult could not gues
__label__1 This app is simple and does exactly as it says. My son has autism and loves it. This will help him learn letters and numbers and their orders. Many apps are too complicated for him, but this one is great.
__label__0 avoid the noid, that wants to kill Android!This app is Cr@p.  Do not install, unless you enjoy losing your INFO.
__label__1 WARNING!!! The thumbs-down mark does not appear to be legitimate!!! See my comments at the end of this review.My three year old loves this app (as well as another one from this company). It helps her practice her alphabet and counting. She loves to push 
__label__1 My five year old daughter loves this! Nice distraction when absolutely necessary, and she's learning at the same time. Thank you so much.
__label__1 this is great for my kids 3 and a half and one and a half. my older child can go through it but its still good practice and my younger child likes pushing the screen.
__label__1 My kids love to play this. We guess what the object will be, then practice counting in sequence and just have fun together. You owe it to your (grand)children to download this for them.
__label__1 great for learning and fun and good for little kids this app is great and its free and fun I think it is awesome for the young
__label__1 This is a great app, keeps my son entertained and he learns at the same time. He loves revealing each new picture and learning the words. At 2, saying "gramophone" and "magnifier" is cute.
__label__1 My two-year-old asks for this game by name. It is a great way to teach and reinforce counting skills. The graphics and voices are very professionally done.
__label__1 IT LOOKS SICK NASTY! OMG I LIKE HAVE TO GET IT LOL ROFL LMBO (laugh my Butt off. I don't like to use bad words...) I want it so bad. its too bad I'm 14...
__label__1 I got this app for my two year old and he loves it. I like the fact that you can do letters or numbers as well as odd or even numbers. Would recommend to anyone with small children.
__label__0 I purchase this app.because I have it on my phone.I got it for my Kindle and it was very very slow so I deleted.it.Sorry I bought it.
__label__0 I was looking for a different experience.  This is not one of the better versions but tolerable while in a waiting room.
__label__1 This game is fun to play. It's a little to fast for me though. ( old grandma hands) it's very exciting to play. And the sound is cool too. I wish this was available when my hands were younger and faster. I would've given it a run for its money. If your u
__label__0 No fun at all, it lags like crazy on my Kindle Fire and Sony Xperia Play.  There are much better jewel games out there...and they're free.  Uninstalled
__label__0 I HATE THIS APP!!! Do not get it. takes 10 seconds for 1 darn heal to trade places with another!!! deleted it within 5 min.
__label__0 wish the Kindle had a better bejeweled version like the one on the I pad.  I will delete it as soon as I can find a better one.
__label__0 I hate it!!! It doesn't work. It doesn't do any. I don't recommend people download this game it doesn't work..
__label__0 It won't let me move anyone and when I try to go towards the ball my players move away. I used the kindle fire HD for this but maybe it only works on the non HD. I am not sure but whatever. And Merry Christmas!
__label__1 A little bit confusing, but overall an ok game. Nice and simple idea the same as the graphics, but bearable.
__label__0 Ok first of all I was playing and and when we switch sides I notice that the goals don't change at all! I erase this game because of that. :(
__label__0 I thought this would be like the old English table top game of Subutteo (not sure if the spelling is correct there). It's not, however, and is dreadful to play. You cannot set up play or block the opposition unless you are on the ball. Then you are limit
__label__0 This game is so boring I deleted as soon as I got it don't waste your time with this game unless You have nothing else to do with your life.
__label__0 This really isn't real soccer if that is what you are interested in. Its really just a pull and release game.Get les.
__label__0 This game is badPros: It is free.It is rated all ages so every one can buy it.It is good for car rides I guess.Cons: It always crashes.It is to easy.You get bored after a while (I'm board of it. I haven't had it for a day).It is not that fun.This is all 
__label__0 the thing doesn't work! you try to kick it and it flings backward! even though it's free don't waste your time getting it.
__label__1 love this app. there are so many recipes on it and it takes up so little space on my kindle.
__label__0 IT DIDNT HAVE LIKE COMMON RECIPES THAT I WAS WANTING SO I JSUT GOT RID OF IT NOT RECOMMENED FOR U
__label__1 This is an awesome app I love how there are so many recipes!It is the best app I ever played. GET THIS APP!!!!!
__label__1 This recipe app is very user friendly...my favorite feature is the &#34;Saved&#34; folder!  I can save my favorite recipes and not have to search through 15,000 recipes again!  Love it!!
__label__1 So simple to put together menus with the recipes in this app.Even my grandkids want to cook now! It's good for the whole family.
__label__0 Unless you enjoy using a magnify glass, don't bother to download this app. How can I give anything a rating higher of one star that I can't see to use. Fail...
__label__1 I have iCookbook on my tablet, and that is nice for pictures and ideas.  I also have Dinner-Spinner which is great and fun and good for ideas.THIS app however takes up only a sliver of space, whereas I've been considering removing my iCookbook because it
__label__1 So many wonderful recipes at the tip of your fingers! Yummy desserts, easy dinners, recipes I haven't seen in years & some I've never seen...but they're all great! Love this app & recommend it!
__label__0 This app should be called 15,000 ads....because that's the biggest thing it has. I was excited to try it, glad I didn't buy it first
__label__1 I really like this app! It has tons of good recipes and what makes it better is that it's free!
__label__1 Good recipies although some do not have the amount of the ingrediant listed.  My kindle will sometimes shut off before I am done with the recips and I'll have to go turn it back on before I can finish cooking.
__label__1 So many recipes, love it!I don't know if I'll be able to go through all the recipes. It's perfect for those days you can't decide on what to cook!!!Will recommend to all my friends.
__label__1 tons of great recipes. Useful &amp; utilitarian. Doesn't have all the bells and whistles, but it runs great on Kindle. Overall, my favorite.
__label__1 great for quick recipes on the go. u also get great ideas. lots and lots of options too. great choice for kindle fire
__label__1 This is better than any cooking website...almost. The makers just need to add a part where you can change the amount you want. For instance I saw this amazing recipe for some type of pudding but it made 1 gallon and I would never finish that much! I woul
__label__1 I am addicted to cook books etc. I love this ap! The recipes that I have tried have been easy to understand and the results were delicious!
__label__1 I llllllllllll oooooooooooooo vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv eeeeeeeeeeeeeee this app it helps me a lot and I love to get new recipies I love it

__label__1 the best thing ever especially for people who love to cook no matter how good or bad they are at it.
__label__1 why does this app rock! ?It rocks because it gives you a variety of recipes and their really simple and new and different. HOPE YOU GUYS LIKE MY REVIEW! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
__label__1 I love this app it has good graphic.Easy to read you can save recipe this app made me a better cook
__label__0 I don't know if it was intentional, but very suggestive ads were appearing in the header of this app.They made me uncomfortable. So I deleted the app.
__label__0 duhhhhhh.... well dont get this app cuz it dosent come with the game for kindle fire LISTEN TO ME DO NOT WASTE UR TIME!!!!
__label__0 and doesn't work well, case of free not such a great deal, I removed it from my device, sorry guys.
__label__0 The app did not work properly and I was not able to use it. A waste of time and effort if you ask me. Sorry.
__label__0 This app sucks. It messed up my crops. Thank God it's just fake crops. -_-&#34;
__label__0 I tryed this timer..it looked promising..but it did not go off at the appointed time...and when it did go off it was so low i could bearly hear it so dont waist your time!
__label__0 I could not get it to work on my kindle I was disappointed so I had to remove it sadly can't have FarmVille on kindle either that's another disappointment too...
__label__1 I have been sleeping better and focusing on making better choices about making sleep a priority. I find that the graphs that show my sleep times have had an impact in understanding why my lack of sleep has made a negative impact on my ability to get work

__label__1 This is great. I suffer from insomnia and I never know how much sleep I didn't get cause I have no clocks in my room. This I hit start when I am about to crash for the night, stop when I wake and it tells me how much sleep I got and how much more I need 
__label__1 This app is amazing!As a guy who suffers from sleep apnea, I find it rather hard to get a full night's sleep, so keeping track of how much I do get is important, and this app does exactly that and more.Tell the app how much sleep you generally (or would 
__label__0 I am now sure this was designed for an Android phone, but it is worthless for any Kinlde Fire. If you have a Fire, don't waster your money.
__label__0 I had to delete this app because it didn't work right on my phone. I needed the space so this was the first to go.
__label__0 The app is good but they want access to too many things. But other than that, it is pretty good.
__label__1 I've been using this for about six and a half months and I've never had a problem.  I love that you can look at various graphs to measure how you're sleeping.  I suffer from insomnia a lot, so this app is extremely helpful in making sure I get enough sle

__label__1 This app is awesome! It totally works title my PSN achievements and friend's list. My friend has an Xbox 360 so we both can get good usage out of it, to top it off... ITS FREAKING FREE! lol
__label__1 this may be the greatest app ever for me I have both psn and xbox so I can control both in 1 app even if u don't have both its still a great app for those gammers its a 2 in 1 deal even if u have only have 1 still a great app
__label__0 After numerous times of attempting to log in... I am still unable to do so. Uninstalling because of this issue. It could be that it doesnt work on my G2.

__label__0 While Play has apps like PS3 Trophies (my favorite) that actually show whether or not your friends are online and detailed trophy info, this app is about the only Amazon option and it doesn't do either. It only show who your friends are and basically the
__label__0 Sad thing is I wouldn't take this again if &#34;they&#34; paid me. App didn't work.... at all.... at anytime. Booooooooooooo
__label__0 Didn't really show much I hooked up my ps3 account and it didn't show anything but a code I wanted to see who was online but I could not do that I could not view my trophies either.
__label__1 Being an Xbox owner, this app fit my needs immediately. I'm going away for Christmas to see my family, and now during the trip, I can check and look back at my trophies and messages. It's almost like Smartglass to me, which is better than no Kindle versi
__label__1 Since I have Xbox Live, this app is perfect for checking my LIVE Status while I'm away! I couldn't ask for a better app! Great Job, Todosjuegos!
__label__1 If only you could actually send messages. Does what it advertises to do. It shows who is on line and what they are playing. Also shows your achievements. Trophies if you have PSN. You can read your messages, but as I said before, you can't send messages.
__label__0 I would love it if my son could actually use this app, however, it has a nasty glitch that won't allow him to actually trace the letters and numbers. It erases everything he does before he gets a chance to be scored on it. This app is lame.
__label__1 I downloaded this app while at dinner one night to keep my niece occupied. She just graduated from kindergarten and loved using this application. It was really easy for her to understand and work herself. It goes through the alphabet in capital and lower
__label__1 When trying to teach my 8yr old how to properly write his letters this app is a fun tool!  I paid for another app that didn't do 1/2 of what this one does. You can choose your own color to write with from many choices, and also choose to practice caps, l
__label__1 Great preschool tool for teaching printing.  Helps with sizing, directionality and line alignment. Great teaching tool and enjoyable for children to use.
__label__1 My child is 3, and he's ambidextrous.  I like that this game sets each letter apart, and he can trace it with either hand.  The directions for each stroke are nice and clear as well, since he has a tendency to try to write in one continuous line (not cur
__label__1 My girls really like it, they spend hours playing with it. I really enjoy the fact that both my kids play it
__label__1 my daughter like it
__label__1 I got this app for my 5 year old daughter. When we're in the car or waiting somewhere she can practice writing her letters, numbers, and shapes. There are a few different things to do.
__label__1 My son who has been diagnosed with autism and my three-year old daughter love the app.  My son has challenges with letter formation.  So this helps him practice when we are on the go.  My 3-year-old daughter loves learning how to write with this app.
__label__1 I have this on my Iconia A500 running 3.2 and it is used daily by my 3 year old son and his older brother. The letters are nicely sized and easy to trace. Our therapists love this app. And it is FREE! Enjoy!

__label__0 At first I was in love with this game. Then when I bought better stuff, got new refineries, and I actually started to get good at this game, the game rejects my Facebook account, won't allow me to access the refinery I waited three days for to get my 700

__label__1 This game is great. The graphics are up to par with such fame's on the app store. Lets just say this. If / rdd
__label__1 This game is quite addicting. Though leveling up doesn't do much, it's fun to buy weapons. The increasing diffuculty and new planets are great.

__label__1 Great game!!! I love playing this and is great when ur bored and I suggest that you get this app. Great guns and places to play in. AWESOME!!!!!
__label__1 yes, it's a freemium game where some of the better stuff requires you to buy in-game cash but it's still a blast without those additional items.
__label__0 Takes for ever to download.  I had to try a few different times.  Then I had to remove a bunch of stuff to be able to play it because it is so big.  I finally start playing and the guy only shoots in one direction.  So dumb do not waste your time.
__label__1 Another great game from flu mobile like the graphics and has good weapons id recommend it to anyone that likes shooter
__label__1 It is really cool that there is a zombie part I think there is enough epic enough and these words are just so I can enter it

__label__1 An over all good fun game and is interestingly strange I need ten more words and were they are right here
__label__1 pretty easy at first then gets challenging. already have predator and coronal ejector!  I wish you could win flu credit though...

__label__1 The title says it all! This game is filled with non-stop action and shooting. I hope you will also enjoy this game!!!
__label__1 I have gotten tons of games for my kindle,  but this is just simply the most fun of them all!

__label__1 if you guys need to know how.to get refineries than log into facebook my name is Pie Pies halpful tipped right their
__label__0 I tried this because I liked the other Glu games contract killer and blood &amp;glory-but couldn't get in to this one.  I found the touch joystick difficult to move my gunbrother where I wanted him to go.
__label__1 I think that it could be a bit cheaper for buying guns and such...but other than that its a great game.
__label__1 This game is really fun.  This is a good game for all ages and it is really hard to stop playing when you get good.
__label__1 Super addictive.  One of the best games on the market. Controls are responsive. Graphics are great. Love it. Get it now
__label__1 well I tried this game on my ipod, it was amazing but since the ipod can't handle the high temperature.anyway this game gives you good experience.
__label__1 Its really fun, controls jiffy at times but otherwise a great game, and the paid portion doesn't take ALL the good stuff away
__label__1 This was an awesome game the guns are amazing this game held my attention for like I don't know just for a really long time
__label__0 You can't fast forward or rewind. There is no volume control. Not very user friendly. I think I'll just keep listing on my iPod.
__label__0 Stops right in the middle of the program on the Kindle Fire.  Furthermore, once you switch apps there is no indicator in status bar or control.
__label__1 Love it - easy to use and download podcasts from.  The sound is crisp, clear and as entertaining as if you were listening live!
__label__1 I like the shows. It is a lot of fun listening too this great site. Especially A Prairie Home Companion.
__label__1 I have been looking for a drawing app that does everything and this is it. It is the only drawing app that comes with directions. There are about 20 different brushes to use including the air brush, caligraphy pen, paint splatter and many others. There i
__label__0 I would give it zero stars!  I tweaked all the brush settings and got ready..... I couldn't use the brush...it didn't work. how dumb. do not bother!
__label__0 plain and simply it sucks seriously. I hate it. whenever I draw something it makes it have a black background even if I didn't ask for one. it starts out white then when I save it it saves one with a black background and what's more when I save a pic I d
__label__0 every time i pick my finger up from drawing,painting what ever i do it makes me force it close but the up side was it is free!!!!:(
__label__1 It works well on my kindle...... The color is nice and when u draw, u can have different textures. Its the best drawing app I have......
__label__1 Lots of options for the artist in you to try out. Learn different techniques and styles with this easy to use app.
__label__0 its terrible. very hard to use. and not really for kids nor adults. i know its free but its a no go.
__label__1 The kids love this, and spend a lot of time with it.  Has been quite entertaining for the family.  As soon as the grand children get to the house, they are ready to open this and play with it.
__label__1 worth the download,  A lot of fun. I let the grand babies play it and it keeps them occupied if we are in a store or in the car and they get restless
__label__1 This app seems incredible and I want to buy it. This review earns five stars. I love to draw so this app would be perfect for artists like me.
__label__1 Perfect for playing pictionary in a long car ride, or even just having a little Doodle time:) I&lt;3 this app its perfect for me, and my friends!!!!!!!!!!!
__label__1 It's a wonderful app and awesome on kindle fire. Very advanced for a free app...but its also simple enough that a toddler can use it and choose different colors and brushes by themselves.
__label__0 This was a silly app to use,  It isn't user friendly and my toddle did not like it.  I didn't even like it just not for me.
__label__0 this game is confusing and just plain weird dont get it and save time. really don't get it I regret waiting three minutes trying to download it.
__label__0 It doesn't glow for one.. It doesn't have different Colorado.. It doesn't let you save pictures.. Takes forever to download.. U have to erase everything u cant clear the page.. Don't get it the drawing pad is unfinished times better than this retarded. t
__label__1 this app is.really fun I love all of the choices!But. sometimes its a little confusing.it runs great on the kindle fire
__label__0 this is the dumbest app ever all you do is draw  draw draw do not get or buy this app
__label__1 This app I just downloaded it and I have not even tried it but it downloaded so so so so fast I'm impressed because allot of other apps that I download slow and after all the waiting I did, it usually not worth it, they end up being crappier game than I 
__label__1 This app is a very nice and fun app. It's sort of like &quot;Paint&quot; in your computer but you have to really draw shapes like circles instead of just clicking and drag. You draw with your finger.I really like this app. One of my favorite.
__label__0 For my kindle, it was terrible. It downloaded and all, but I mean, you need a particular software for the anderoid. So it doens't work on the kindle just a heads up
__label__1 I prsanle love this app.so if you love art this is a game for you.it is free so no risk. if you sumit a thing do 5 stares.
__label__1 I love it sooooo much. I can't. halp my it I Ripley to eavre thinks. i love it sooo.  much
__label__0 I drew some pictures I didn't like and accidentally saved them. Now I cant delete them! it is a wretched game. I'll find a BETTER Doodle game.
__label__1 I'm running Magic Doodle Free on my Kindle Fire, and it runs fine. This is a nice drawing program, and easy to learn, with its Quick Start tutorial (English and French language) that only takes a couple of minutes to go through. You can set the canvas si
__label__0 I think this was the worst app i ever bought. And it is a huge waste of time DON'T BUY THIS APP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
__label__1 has some really nice brushes to play with. wish there were just a few more, but what it does come with are really neat
__label__1 I love this game because there are so many tools you can use and you can make pictures on the to without the mess. if your a art freek, I suggest you get this game
__label__0 Ok I don't know about the rest of you people but unroll i read the total of this app I thought it was a smoking app whoever made this app should serriously reconsider the picture for it. just saying :-l
__label__1 We downloaded this free app to our tween's new Kindle Fire and she loves it.  It is very user friendly and she has a lot of fun creating her Gallery of "master" pieces.  It has a wide variety of colors, brushes and effects for the user to choose from and
__label__1 The 2 yr old I watch loves the "playback" feature, and I think that it is easy to understand for even him.
__label__1 This was purchased for my Grand Kids and they have not been able to try it out as of yet.
__label__1 I like how u can change everything to writing from easering!!!! also u have alot of Colors to pick from!!  if u want to just Doodle this is a great app!!
__label__1 another must have in the back seat to keep the kids happy on a trip in the car must get
__label__1 This is a great app on my Samsung Tab. Great tools to work with; can not be moved to sd card but still fantastic.
__label__1 My Grandaughter will play for a long time on this app. She loves it and it is good for her imagination.
__label__0 I got the free version.  It let me doodle about 2 lines before crashing.  After a few tries I deleted it off my Kindle Fire 8.9.  I reinstalled it and it started completely differently with a tutorial.  I was very hopeful, but no luck.  It draws 2 lines 
__label__1 this is a really good app that you can do a lot with and make some really cool stuff with regally think its better than the other apps you have to pay for
__label__0 you might as well not download it get the other kind that is better it has more stuff so dont

__label__1 I use the Amplified Bible when having my church service and find it easy to use.  It conveniently fits into my pocketbook, however, I still use a writting pad to keep my notes and then can transfer them to the &#34;Notes&#34; tab on the device after serv
__label__1 This is a wonderful Bible. I love the note and search feature. I had a more expensive version downloaded with some features, but this one has it access to more and easier to navigate. You will love it and find it simple to use.
__label__1 This bible app is very easy to use and I appreciate how straight forward it is to get to each book , chapter, avd verse.
__label__1 i have a lot of Bibles on my kfhd, some of them are ebooks and some, like this one, are apps- Tecarta is by far the best, in my opinion.....presently i own three versions of the Bible on this app, and the best feature for me is that i can split the scree
__label__1 This app is great for all who want to read and or study the Bible. Any translation you might want is here from the King James to The Message and many more. There's also quite a few different commenttaries.As a Bible teacher, I love the ability to take no
__label__1 I am a preacher and I have found this app on my kindle fire to be a great asset in preparation of my sermons.I would highly recommend this app to anyone.
__label__1 I love this app!  I have purchased 4 verisons of Gods word and use them to compare so that i can get as close to the original meaning as I can.
__label__1 This Bible has helped with my studies. Easy reading. Whenever the passage we are reading is in old school I just get this book out.
__label__1 I just started using the Amplified Bible on my KindleFire and I am finding it very user friendly.  What a great way to be able to look up verses by address AND search for parts of verses and be able to find the address.  It is a great tool to have.  Than
__label__1 I am in love with the Tecarta bible apps.  They are so easy to use and are done in such a way that you can find your scripture with no difficulty.
__label__1 I have this bible in book form but having it on a kindle is much easier and quicker to access.
__label__1 I really enjoy this app in this version in the parallel feature. What a joy to be able to open this on my kindle and not have to carry multiple versions or big, clunky parallels. I love my paper Bible and always will, but this app holds a new place among
__label__1 Great book, very informative. I will advise anyone to come and use the Amazon site for movies, music and anything else they need.
__label__1 A really good and well done bible app.  I would recommend it  for anyone.  Go get it.  It is very complete.
__label__1 Review extensively revised 14 Jun:I've been using Bible Apps since I got my Kindle Keyboard three years ago. Got a Kindle Fire G1 for Christmas 2012 and started trying to use Bible apps on it. Most of the old apps were not too functional on the Kindle Fi
__label__1 I have only used this app a couple of times and it is very easy to use.  I love it!!!
__label__1 The Amplified Bible is a wonderful resource.  It lets you see what some of the words might also mean and give a nice alternative of flipping from version to version to get clarity.
__label__1 This App Is Wonderful.. I Am Just Starting Out To Read My Bible More.. And This Apps Me To Understand What Exactly I Am Reading..
__label__1 No comment Why do I have to make a comment I love the book that should be comment enough. Tks
__label__1 Good app all around! Please make it a lil easier to navigate. And more ways to personalize the look. Other than that I'm enjoying having this version, without the need for an internet connection!
__label__1 This has been my transliteration of preference for about 40+ years now. It's great to have it on my devices.
__label__1 Excellent addition to my library. Along with New King James version.  I am still trying to figure out how to use these apps.
__label__1 This is a great app. Very easy to use . I use it more than the other bibleapps.  And I take it every where I travel.
__label__0 I don't know who to believe one say it is good others say no I don't even know what to write
__label__0 this is a great time waster it wont even install so if you have a kindle fire DONT GET THIS APP.
__label__1 if your one of those people who like simple and fun games then this game is for you this should be at the top of the free list by now
__label__0 I got this game thinking it would be another Doodle jump but its worse. You should totally try Pepe Up its a free app with way better graphics and you can change the character by collecting apples :)
__label__0 okay in nh opinion someone tried to remake Doodle jump and wasn't successful !:( I recommend u don't get this even though its free its just a waste of your timethis game sucks! !!!!!:(
__label__0 this game is stupid! I even let my kids play it and they said it was dumb and haven't played it in the passed few.months. I wouldn't even get it if it was free!
__label__1 For some reason I really enjoyed playing this silly game! It challenges you to budget and plan wisely in order to turn a profit with your stand. You can choose to play a 1 day version, or a 7 day, and you can speed up hwo quickly time goes by if you choo
__label__0 Didn't like the game not that fun not worth the time. hard it don't play what can I say bad game
__label__1 all I can say is compared to other jewel games it's never boring.  having the time limit and your need for quick thinking and action is very entertaining.
__label__1 What can you say other than it really gives you daily deals.  Some deals may be a bit esoteric, but it is fun to see what is up for discounts and on sale.
__label__1 This app is great!  I have found some really great deals here!  Keep them coming! I look just about every day for an awesome deal to steal!
__label__0 After answering many questions that took me a very long time to answer, I was not shown a picture of a beige impala in Djibouti.
__label__0 the title says it all, takes ten years and a hundred questions later to do some stupid parlor trickdon't waste your time
__label__0 don't get this app.  it only has 1 pic. at the end and it is an elephant.  it is not an app I perferabley would get.
__label__1 really cool I LOVE to see the looks on peoples face when I get it right if you dontt understand then look at it a little more carefully
__label__0 okay. the numbers always get you to 4 which is the letter D.  I've seen the next series of questions ask you to pick a country with that letter (Denmark) then animal starting with last letter of that (Kangaroo).  Then, pick a color starting with that las
__label__0 Love this game!! I really love this game and hope everyone else has fun playing it, even though it's really not a game.
__label__1 omg!!! I was freaked out when it was right!! (I'm a teen so I'm easy to fool)  but omg I love the faces people make when they get that picture!!! spool worth it!!!  there's a trick but its sooooooooooooooooo fun!!! XD
__label__0 this app is not for kindle fire owners do not buy I have to fore - close every time I reapeat DO NOT BUY KINDLE OWNERS
__label__0 don't get this app bcuz it does not even work.i tried like,a gazzilion billion times,but it still does not work.its a good thing u don't pay money for this,cuz it would b a waste of money.
__label__1 Much better the the calandar app that was bundled with DX, especially in handling multiple calandarsPlus- able to see appt by description vs just a color bar- different color bar or desc color depending on which calandar it's onBug issues that exist in D
__label__1 i didnt like it at first, but its definitely more intuitive and easy to use than the normal calendar app. the only down side is that the calendar view widget shows a screenshot of your calendar which looks kind of crappy as a result of scaling. i have no
__label__1 I recently switched to the free version of this calendar app because I was sick of how bad the interface was on all the other calendar apps I'd tried. Now I see the full version offered for free today, there's absolutely no reason not to switch! Get it w
__label__1 Until you install this great app, you don't know how much functionality you are missing from your android powered phone. Once you install it though, your phone becomes a beast!!!
__label__1 Much better than stock calendar, great options. Would be nice if Month view was optimized for tablets and showed description of events.
__label__1 Great app. Does everything I was looking for as I rely heavily on my android's calendar. There are many settings you can choose from to set it just the way you want.
__label__1 I got this app for free over a year ago through FAOTD. Most apps that I've grabbed through the promo last a month or so, then I either find something I like better or decide I can live without due to their memory requirement (I have the original HTC Incr
__label__1 I've tried several free calendar apps but still felt something was missing. Now I won't use anything else.I got this as an Amazon FAOTD. now that I've tried it I paid to have it on my other devices.Widgets for every screen size. So many customizations yo
__label__1 i beyond love this app. it has a super friendly interface and is very simple to use. it does everything that i want it to. if your ocd like me you will love that it lets you color code everything. which makes knowing whats on your schedule super easy. th
__label__1 Great app and a huge improvement over the stock calendar and anything else available.  Its easy to navigate and syncs with my calendar without flaw. A couple of changes could include the current date on the widget and also to be able to scroll on the wid
__label__1 On my HTC G2 I use it just as an app, and on my Iconia I really love the widgets. Highly customizable in both size and  timeframe in both app and widget. This and Thumb Keyboard are my 2 FAOTD I don't know how I would live without. Good to see continued 
__label__1 Works perfectly with Google calendar, it is elegant and no frills. It has different views, daily, weekly, monthly, perfect for at a glance info.
__label__1 seems to work perfectly so far so maybe it was worth the $5....I like all the options and seems simple. widget options r great too
__label__0 i got this for from amazon app store. even with several reboots it would either freeze or force quit. really bummed.
__label__1 If you are a Google calendar user with multiple calendars this app is the easiest way to organize them on the go. I love it!
__label__1 I've had an Android phone for 3+ years now, but haven't ever used the stock calendar because it's not user friendly. I don't like paying for apps, so I just kept my good ol' paper calendar. This app made me chuck the paper and now I am only using my phon
__label__1 I love this calendar. The views give me the information I need in a look that works for me. Whenever someone sees me looking up an appointment they always ask &#34;how do I get my calendar to look like that&#34;? I tell them for the price this is the bes
__label__1 Great replacement calendar app for the EVO 3D, i was having problems with the sense one loading up but this one is great. Loads all my appointments on the widget really fast and syncs perfectly with all my google calendars
__label__1 Love this calendar.  Way better than the droid x's default calendar.  I was actually hoping that amazon would give this away, and to my suprise, they actually did.  Love it.
__label__1 Have been using this calendar for personal and business for the last few months and greatly appreciate how easy and quick it is to operate.
__label__1 Great app! Needed something like this. I'll let SwiftKey finish this review. You should therefore carry out your own virus checks before opening any attachment. Please note that the information in this outgoing message. Haha! Love it
__label__0 I tried the app and it was not as good as pure grid calendar widget... I then uninstalled and it messed up the connection with my Google account calendar, so they no longer pull up anything for any other calendar including stock calendar.  On Evo 4G.
__label__1 great customizations, great user interface, very smooh to use, very intuitive to operate, i also am in love with the little pop ups - this calendar app is the best! i was actually using the free version exclusively before this, thank you amazon!
__label__1 This app is very nice and fairly easy to use. I use it all the time and have gotten the hang of some of the features and all potentials this app gives! They get back to you quickly if you have a question or problem and they don't get all technical when r
__label__1 Great app, much better than stock. Note that although the store says it is not optimized for Honeycomb, it does still work very well with it - don't let that put you off.  The only (very small) issue is the lack of resizable widget (which is a Honeycomb 
__label__1 This is a wonderful Calendar app. The interface is appealing and easy to follow and adding new events is a snap!Much better than the default calendar.
__label__0 its great and all. but it lacks exchange support: specifically push exchange.  my company cannot wait for a periodic update they need my appointments now and I need theirs now.  when you add an appointment here it can take hours before your work calendar
__label__1 i particularly love that it will display TEXT for every item, even in Month view.[And more words so the review will publish]
__label__0 Widgets stopped working. They were working just fine and then they randomly just stopped. Very annoying! this is something that should be fixed as soon as possible!
__label__1 This is such a great application that it ought to be the builtin android calendar. I don't know how I would do without it now that I'm familiar with all its features and have come to depend upon it. My two favorite features are the expanding day view whi
__label__1 I'm so glad I've got this calendar. The calendar that came with my phone did interesting things to my events that Outlook was not fond of, like set the event as a meeting. IDK, I am not disappointed at all.
__label__1 Love it. The agenda view does a good job of packing a lot of info in an organized way. Well done.
__label__1 Love the fact that there are multiple widget sizes. I like to keep a small version on my home screen. Stock one was to large and needed to be on secondary screen. Well layed out and easy to use and read.
__label__1 I've used quite a few calendar apps and by fat this one is the best. Does everything I want an calendar to do and more.
__label__1 I got this as the FAOTD and use out exclusively a my goto calender app. It easily pulls in any other calender information you may have like googles calender. It has a very intuitive interface and uncluttered display. This app would have been worth purcha
__label__1 This is the most user friendly calendar I have found,  but more importantly it has a widget that will show you upcoming appointments.  This is a must for me and business calendar does a great job with it.
__label__0 I didn't read the advertising closely enough or I would have realized I didn't want anything to do with it.  There is a legal doctrine that says if you provide a third party with your private information, you have no reasonable expectation of privacy.  I
__label__1 This app is just what I was looking for.  It syncs with google perfectly.  The widget is great too.  Adding new events is easy and quick.  So many options..  love it!
__label__1 Best by far of several paid calendars I tried. I need excellent calendar functionality for my business and this application has it.
__label__1 Tried the free version and liked it so i bought the paid app.  Has an issue when changing versions where I lost my home screen widget and couldn't get it back but uninstalling/reinstalling fixed that.  Works great on my Galaxy S2 Skyrocket.  The stock To
__label__1 Has all the features I was looking for and several that I didn't realize I SHOULD have been! Well done!
__label__1 As many have said, its a great app, better than the stock app. Great display of appointment times. The widgets it allows are also very useful. Worth buying,  in. my opinion.
__label__1 I've tried other calendar apps, and this is by far the best. Developers keep improving it, too. Way better than the stock Android calendar. Syncs flawlessly with my Google calendar. While I got it for free, I would definitely pay $5 for it...it's worth i
__label__1 I really like this software calendar it works fantastic! i do use several on my devices due to one does something the other doesn't! this however is moving closer to the all in one!
__label__1 I have been using Business Calendar for about a year now and I love it.  It has a ton of customizing features to view your calendar events just the way you like it.  The week starts on sunday at 7am and I can view it that way when looking at month, week,
__label__1 I love this calendar!  It is tons better than the one that came preinstalled on my droid x. In particular I like that it shows bars representing meeting times and lengths even in month view, so I can decide if a particular week is too hectic for a meetin
__label__1 this calendar integrates very well with the Google calendar.  I wish the developer would come out with a honeycomb version.
__label__1 This calendar is really a great way to keep your events straight! I saw an earlier review that said the app needs a bi weekly repeat, it has one! My work schedule is a bi weekly schedule and the calendar keeps it synced perfectly.
__label__1 Until Business Calendar, I have never been fully satisfied with any of the calendar apps on Android, and I've tried many. They all seem to be either fast but overly-simplified and lacking features, or feature-full, resource hogs and slow, slow, slow.I fi
__label__1 The app works great on my rooted DX running latest ota. It has a nice widget that is highly customizable and the interface reminds me of the Cal app on my mac.
__label__1 Works perfectly.  Best app I've found to replace the lackluster default calendar app in most phones.  Makes my life SO much easier entering my work schedule, seeing as many times I'll work different hours each day of the week.  Really like that it saves 
__label__1 This is a great app to have. It's a nice planner with many different options I'd recommend it for everyone!
__label__1 50,000,000 Frenchmen can't be wrong, nor a whole bunch of Amazon reviewers.  This is my favorite calendar app, but Amazon's insistence that one be logged in to Amazon makes it DANGEROUS!  I don't mind being logged into Amazon.  The problem is figuring ou
__label__1 This cal. is the best out there for androind. its so easy to use and it makea your schedule easy to follow. eveyone should downlod this right away
__label__1 Much better than the one that comes built in.  I love the widget options.  Very handy addition, and worth the money.
__label__1 the recent updates have made this app amazing keep up the great work.. The new widget design has made this app extraordinary
__label__1 quite simply the best calendar app. I tried them all... this one syncs with outlook and google calendar very well. Info is displayed as well as can be expected on a phone. Love it...use it all the time
__label__1 I almost didn't bother downloading this app.  Although I'm not really happy with the stock calendar (it always opens on the wrong day - maybe it's an EVO thing?)  who'd have thought someone could build a better app than Google on Google's android platfor
__label__1 This is the best calendar I've tried.  I got it as the free app of the day but it would be worth paying for.It lets me change the calendar of a preexisting appointment - the native app won't.
__label__1 can't beat free. downloaded app it's good. better interface and easier to use than stock calendar on droid droid. me likes!
__label__1 I love this app. It's useful, it's well implemented, and it makes life simpler.  My one complaint was just fixed with an update.  This app is my absolute favorite calendar app.  It has a slick interface, fluid design, smart views, and now a scroll-able a
__label__1 Love this app. Tried 5 or 6 different ones until I ran into this. Works great with google and the display option are very nice and well thought out. A definate winner.
__label__1 I like this program much better than default Google calendar. It is much easier to enter new tasks and it is way easier to review existing tasks. Month view is especially nice and does the best job of making up for the lack of mouse hover that I have see
__label__1 Who is giving this a 4 star? This is by far the best calendar app. Don't look any further. Thanks to amazon to offer it for free long ago as the daily app. Just buy it and enjoy it. So many widgets and customizable functions that puts many developers inc
__label__1 I downloaded many calendar apps before this one, and deleted them all.  Nothing would properly sync to my google calendar.  This works perfectly, has awesome widget options, and reminds me of iCal on my mac (which I totally miss).  Definitely get this!
__label__1 I've been using Business Calender by Appgenix Software for about four years now and will not change.  It is user friendly and easy to learn.
__label__1 one of my new favorites!  way better than stock calendar on my atrix.  great interface no bugs.  for the cost of a beer to stay organized with seamless simplicity?  heck yes I'll give 5 * thank you biz cal
__label__1 there is no better calendar than this one if you have android 3 or below, and even the new 4.0 calendar is only AS good as this one
__label__1 This is the absolute best calander app out there. Does EVERYTHING! Your missing out if you don't have it already. Got to get tablet optimized widgets though. Need a 6x6 minimum for tablets.
__label__1 This is awesome! !! i can't believe it's here and free.Seriously,  Google should make this default calendar and have developer retire in the Tropics. Or better yet develope more apps for Google and stay rich. Yup, it's that good.
__label__1 I have been looking for a better calendar and this is it.  love it! HTC sensation and it is wonderful.  links Google calendar.....can not live without it!
__label__1 I wasn't happy with my old calendar, but this one is great. it is very customizable. I like that I can take birthday notices off the calendar of Facebook people I dont know. And I'm happy about being able to change the colors to something that appeals to
__label__1 I have tried other calendars, but this is the one that provides the highest level of organization. The ability to set the specific modes &amp; details enhances theoverall effectiveness of the calendar.
__label__0 once installed seemed to slow my droid x to a crawl. at one point locked it up altogether. had to uninstall.
__label__1 I use this calendar daily. I use it more than daily. It integrates perfectly with my Android device, updates perfectly from Google Calendar on the web, integrates others' scheduling opportunities into mine and makes my life livable.If it ain't written on
__label__1 This is by far the best third party calendar app that I've ever used. Everything about it just suits me perfectly. The whole app just flows flawlessly.
__label__0 A very generic app that is sort of needlessly complicated. Why buy this when you can do everything it can do a pencil and a piece of paper? Pass on it.
__label__0 I spent $5 on this because it allegedly works with Kindle Fire and synchs may calendar from tootle, but it doesn't.  Maybe one day it will, but as of 12/5/2011 it does not.
__label__1 I was never a huge fan of the default calendar app, and had found Touch Calendar to be my best option for an alternative to the default from the Google market.  When this was released as a free app, I thought I would try to see if it worked better than T
__label__1 This has been my go-to app for keeping times straight since it was in early beta.The graphic representation of time slots has helped me to keep appointments I might have otherwise overlooked.
__label__1 This is probably the most valuable app on my phone. This keeps me on track with meetings and appointments and I can't figure out how I managed without it for all these years.
__label__1 This app is better than the stock calendar by far. I love that you can see start and end times in the widget. Being able to select a few days up to two weeks at a time is amazing. Also the one touch adding is nice. Who would have thought that someone cou
__label__1 Very good integration of Gmail calendar functions.  Extremely flexible and easy to use.  Definitely worth the price (although I got it for free).
__label__1 It's very intuitive.  Not much more to say. Worth the money. And, you can coordinate multiple accounts. Would be even better with Reqall.
__label__1 latest upgrade is a really good calendar.  Easy to use, easy to see items, syncs works perfectly with my PC's G-calendar.  I'm glad I got it.
__label__1 I've used the Jorte calendar for a year and it was my fave, but it cant sync added calendars in your google account, like Jewish Holidays...well, this one can! the monthly view (my default and fav) is a little ugly and hard to decypher on this app, but t
__label__1 Pretty stoked about this app. I haven't fully explored all it has to offer yet, but I have gone through the standard initial setup and some basic customizations. I like the range of color coding options and its eagerness to sync my calendars. I can't wai
__label__1 I'll preface this review by saying that i've used calendargoo and touch calendar extensively. I thought calengoo's drag & drop style abilities were awesome, this is just in a whole new league.Business calendar is still being very actively developed, whic
__label__1 Usually I get the free version before going to a paid app, but since this was an app that I knew I would be using a lot, I decided to jump in with 2 feet &amp; bypass the free version.As reluctant as I was to pay $4.99, it was definitely $ well spent.  T
__label__1 Pretty good. still has a little room to grow. icons / buttons on widget look childish. app should directly handle reminders instead of letting stock calendar do it. at least provide option to go to this app from reminder if nothing else. despite these sm
__label__1 Love the text and colors in month view, and seeing days events without opening another screen is great. Huge selection of widgets saved five cells of screen real estate with no loss of info (actually, more info!) Haven't even explored all options... Rela
__label__1 what a great calendar. can't believe I got it for free. was suffering with pocket informant for too long. now have switched to this. just wish u could set option to &quot;snap to grid&quot; when scrolling horizontally. hopefully some updates will resolve
__label__1 Far more functional than the calendar app that came with my phone, and, just as importantly, far faster!Overall very well-designed. Uses the phone's sync software, so doesn't work around the phone's problems with Facebook calendar sync (appointments an h
__label__1 I was on the fence about getting this for a few days. Normally the built in apps are pretty hard to best.  They may be Spartan, but they trend to be good.  This app is really amazing.  This is what should come with the phone!
__label__1 I've tried a few other calendar apps but this is the best so far. It has a few features I haven't seen before but really wanted, like the option to set the default amount of time for a reminder before an event, or to remove it completely, which is great 
__label__1 This is a great calendar app.  I like the widget.  I have configured to show three days.  One tap and I see the month.  One swipe and I can see the swiped days in an hourly view. Love it.
__label__1 This app has a great interface! Unlike the standard Android Calendar, this app mimics the online calendar interface available on gmail by overlaying a date's agenda on top of a month view. In my opinion this feature is better than the OEM Calendar method
__label__0 Bis calendar only shows colored square in month view if you have an entry so you have to tap each one to see what they are. That was the biggest annoyance with HTC calendar. Jorte displays the text. Has more view options and it DOES sync with Google. I c
__label__1 Does everything I need it to do. Much better than the stock calendar. Very flexible. Works well with numerous Google calendars simultaneously. HTC ThunderBolt
__label__1 This is an excellent calendar replacement. Slick, fast, and intuitive. I would recommend this app to anyone looking for a full featured calendar replacement.
__label__1 Using on my Kindle Fire HDX. It has a super friendly interface and is very simple to use. it does everything that i want it to.  I have been able to use it without being logged into the Amazon site as other reviews have stated. I would recommend it to ot
__label__1 by far the most fundamentally sound, and functional app.  this is the type of calender app I have been wanting for quite some time now. very versatile and customized for the android user. great job! the 6th app I've ever rated 5 stars.
__label__1 Wow.  Had I known how good this little gem was, I would have dropped the Lincoln back when I got my Android.  Clean, smooth, seamless.  Amazing the features and power of this application.  I love the fact that it picked up my Google calendars automatical
__label__1 I use this to consolidate my personal and work calendars and the calendars of my wife and kids. Does a great job. Better than stock Google calendar. It's the first app I install on new devices.
__label__1 Simply put, this makes life easier, adding imperative features to what you'd get with just the stock google calender. I can't really think of anything to complain about. I guess if I had to try really hard to find something, I could say it's not &quot;pr
__label__1 If you are running the CyanogenMod 7 OS, you cannot edit calendar events from an exchange calendar with the standard Android calendar.  With this app, it lets you do just that.  This is a very nice feature on top of the wealth of other features.  The hom
__label__0 android market has jan 15 2012 version and amazon does not.lame for a paid app and cheating amazon users.
__label__1 The only thing that made me unhappy about upgrading from an ancient and unsupported Palm Treo 680 to an Android device was the lack of calendars comparable in look and functionality to the Palm calendar, which was unquestionably the best mobile calendar 
__label__0 Awesome app with a lot of potential but lacking a lot of integration.  For one,  it doesn't play nice with exchange as it does not allow you to view all of your exchange calendars,  only your primary one.  To see those calendars I ended up getting touchd
__label__1 Easily the most useful app I have ever downloaded from the app store. I use to use the standard android calender to manage my school and work schedule, but I hated not being able to easily view my friends schedule. Not only does this app allow this, but 
__label__1 This is exactly what I have been looking for in a replacement for the generic Google Android calendar.  The flexible month/week/day views and appointment options are really nice, as is the information box when selecting an individual appointment.  Anothe
__label__1 When I looked at the details and it specified that it is not optimized for Android 3.0, I was very skeptical but I like to test things on my Xoom anyway.  It actually looks and works beautifully and kind of shocked me at how smoothly it flowed and how qu
__label__1 Works well, syncs with Gmail calendar smoothly. This is an app, I'm willing to pay for. Adding new events is easy and smooth.
__label__1 Far superior to any calendar app I've seen. LOVE IT!Here's some more words to satisfy the twenty word minimum
__label__1 I have tried several different calendars and so far this is cream of the crop! The adjustable widget allows for a full months view without the need for opening the calendar fully. Also the different colors and settings make it that much better.
__label__1 Being a former BlackBerry user, I have never been really thrilled with the calendar app on my EVO. Fortunately, UNLIKE on the BlackBerry, there are several alternatives to the stock app. I had already been using the &quot;Smooth Calendar&quot; widget as 
__label__1 Very nice, thanks Amazon! This app gives you a lot of great features I haven't seen anywhere else, like a quick way to select multiple days to view. It is super quick and smooth, and gives you a pretty good widget to use on the homescreen. It's not quite
__label__1 I like that you can color code your differerent calendars, you can have calendars from different accounts, and there are many different size widgets. You can make templates for adding new events to your calendar, you can invite others to it, you can basi
__label__1 Exactly what I've been looking for! its awesome being able to see everything on my agenda without having to open any programs and with so many different widget options!!
__label__1 This is a very well thought  out, designed application. I like the widget also. They should consider putting a screen shot of the widget in the marketplace page too.
__label__1 I downloaded thus back in the beta and was amazed at the polish and features of this app. The widgets are marvelous. The interface its intuitive. I purchased this one within days of it being available. keep up the good work guys!
__label__1 Usually the free apps are so poor and at last a great one.didn't know this one and it's better than the stock appointment and calendar app of htc even. Doesn't look the best but very functional.
__label__1 Very nice GUI and helpful widget to show the whole week calender on my phone. Very easy to add new events. They start to add some new alarm feature which is not bug-free but I believe the developer will make things better.
__label__1 This us by far the best calender app out.  I have been using it for about 9 months and wouldn't be with it it.
__label__1 This is a great calender app with lots of features. Has a lot of useful options, easy to read and enter dates into. Use it every day.
__label__1 I love this app. I use the widget to show me the upcoming days and agendas. it is awsome. I would use this widget not droid.
__label__1 What a great calendar app! I find that both the agenda view and the widgets are far superior to anything else I've tried. *win*
__label__1 Ever since I first got the original droid I wanted a calander widget that can place a full calander on my screen.  This is the first one that I found that does exactly what I wanted, a 4x4 calander that shows the whole month in either a list of events pe
__label__1 I am and have been a big user of my google calendar.  I love how this is an extension of my PC google calendar, its simple and easy to use, the views are customizable and alerts work great.  never FC'd on ?y HTC G2.
__label__0 1. Wrong days on monthly view. A total shift: all Sundays appear as Mondays, Mondays shift into Tuesdays etc.2. current week on weekly view is totally BLANK!This is very bad for a pricey useless calendar. I have emailed the developers. Even added screen 
__label__1 Blows the default calendar out of the water.  Actually worth $6 if you're a business user, I actually feel a little guilty using this for free. Nice thing is apps like launcher pro's calendar widget integrate perfectly with all the add/delete/etc feature
__label__1 I have used the free version of this app for several months and have really enjoyed it. So glad I waited on buying it. Uninstall free.. Install full version for free. Sweet. -HTC EVO
__label__1 Was not able to get this app to work, BUT I have a discontinued Pandigital tablet that may not have the correct operating system etc. so do not blame the app - blame the tablet.
__label__0 This was not what i expected at all. it may be because I am new to apps in general. but this was more a commercial
__label__0 I wanted to use this to get an idea of what my return would be.  I went through all of the steps only for it to tell me at the end my taxes were too complex.  Probably good app for people with very simple deductions etc...
__label__1 I just used it to predict my taxes for this year and it was easy and quick.I was a little apprehensive so I put in my info from last year and it got my refund 100% correct from last year. So it looks like this year will be accurate or very close. Yay!
__label__1 I used the tax estimator and thought it worked well.  I just had to put in a minimum amount of information,  We'll see how close it comes when I finally do my taxes.
__label__1 i uninstalled this app because i had no more need for it. it did give me a nice quote that was only $100 or so off from being accurate, i got more than i expected
__label__0 Just personal only - that I don't put my SSN on line for any app - and there for didn't use it...............
__label__0 I have no idea what this is supposed to do. Looked like a great idea of an app, but turned out I did not need it so deleted it from my Kindle.
__label__1 but we will find out how accurate it was!  Very simple formulas, easy app, works well on the kindle!  Try it!
__label__1 Very easy to use and gives a good &#34;ballpark&#34; figure of what your return might be. Worth the purchase. Thanks.
__label__1 It's so easy to use. You can make as many notes as you want. The app autosaves when you exit. Also dates the last time you touched that note. Now I don't have to look for a pen and paper. My kindle is always next to me so this works out perfectly. No pro

__label__1 I am the most forgetful person there is....wow this works great for me, just looking at it seeing what I have to do or buy at the store for that day.
__label__1 Just what I wanted to record little pieces of information; free of a bunch of words, directions, or extra information.
__label__1 it does what it says it does, so I'm perfectly satisfied with that, nothing more to ask for! if an app lives up to its description it gets five stars from me!

__label__1 I use InkPad on my Kindle Fire. I think it is a great app. The very small ads at the top don't bother me one bit. I also think that it is super convenient that my notes are saved automatically. It makes the title be the first line of your note, which you

__label__0 this app was not the best.  It was  almost too simple.  I didn't like the icon either, it looked fuzzy on my screen.  it was more of an eyesore than the ads.

__label__1 I use it as a to-do list. It is also great as a grocery list. since I carry my Kindle in my purse, I can update things at any time. When people give me addresses, I can note them here and never lose that piece of paper!  It is also easy to name a list or

__label__1 I just needed a simple way to organize information and this fit the bill. Easy to use, an easy to understand
__label__1 It is just an ordinary notepad. The reason it has 5 stars is that you don't need a pen and you don't have to buy a notepad.

__label__1 This is the best thing I've come across for notes on the Kindle Fire. Don't get the newer version from other markets unless you need he search feature, though, since it just adds synching with Google (which the Kindle Fire doesn't support, yet). Part of 
__label__1 This is exactly what it says it is... A note pad - not a word processor. It only has one font, (actually two - Android or Inkpad's)  and and there are no formatting tools. It is easy to enter your info and the entry is easy to save by either the first wo
__label__0 As soon as I installed it and tried it, I uninstalled it and found better free apps within minutes.  It was too difficult to write with and being left-handed (although I'm sure that made a difference) it was just to tiresome to operate.

__label__1 I loved the built-in Notepad on my iPod Touch, but since I got my Kindle Fire, I haven't looked back. I downloaded and tried many &quot;notepad&quot; apps to use instead, but none were as good as the one for iOS. Some are great though, with color coding

__label__1 I use this app all the time. You don't have to &#34;save&#34; it or do anything special with formatting, etc. It's always handy.
__label__1 Overall this is a great list creation app.  I currently have numerous short and long term &#34;TODO&#34; lists as well as stored data lists that I am working from.  My only regret is the lack of a separate keyboard to attach to the Kindle Fire.  The touc

__label__1 This is a fun app my grandkids like to use it. Once I get my full size blue tooth keyboard I will have even more fun with it.
__label__0 I did not like the way this app looks.  The note pad always appears blurry.  Otherwise, it works fine for what it was intended.
__label__1 I really like this note book. I like that each note page has a title and you don't need the Internet to use it. I just have to remember to charge my kindle before I go out. I have a page for my grocery list. My list of movies I want to watch. My to do li
__label__1 I am using it for a journal of sorts for the year. Good app. Easy to use and it saves what you are doing.
__label__0 At least I did. It wasn't what I was looking for so I deleted it from my KindleFire. I was hoping for something like looseleaf where I could write my own lists, in my hand, not typing it out letter by letter with my stylus which just frustrated me.
__label__1 This app is helpful, well organised, and easy to use. Perfect for taking notes or any other kind of writing.
__label__1 I LOVE inkpad on my Kindle Fire. Tho I have an app on my phone, this is a fun way to have other lists of things I want at a glance too. Really a neat app! Thanks
__label__1 It keeps my notes organized and in one place. Sticky notes are great but I'll grab it off the frig and lose them or not be able to find them in my purse. The inkPad is great for taking notes while on the phone too.

__label__1 What a great little app. It's not elaborate, just enough. The email feature is great. You can make a shopping list on the Kindle, email it to yourself, and have the list on your phone when you're out. So easy. If there are ads, I have yet to notice them.
__label__1 This product was perfect for me because I am always writing down quick notes or ideas for stories and hate having to waste paper on notes that are going to be disposed not to long after they are written. It keeps them all in order for me and allows them

__label__1 I was surprised to find that the Kindle didn't have a notepad app standard and that I had to download one. This was exactly what I was looking for. Something simple that I can jot notes down on. Great, simple app.
__label__1 As a recent convert from Palm OS, one of the things I really needed was the ability to take notes for my consulting gig. InkPad works well in this regard. InkPad allows you to store multiple notes in a fashion similar to the note pad app baked into Palm 
__label__1 With neurologic damage to my hands, I no longer write legibly.  This little notepad has saved me!  I take my Kindle everywhere with all of my lists and reminders right at my finger tip.  This is a great product.
__label__1 I was looking for a free writing app and this was it.  I didn't think that it would allow me to type short stories and save them, but it supplies ample space and saves previous notes.  It also allows you to send the note to an email address if necessary.
__label__1 I really like this app. If you want and/or need a note app, this one is a great pick. It's virtually the same as the Apple version of notepad. I like how you don't have to manually save the notes, and it just saves by itself.
__label__1 Works for me. Write notes, save paper, save money. What you see is what you get!Just what I wanted.
__label__1 This is a fabulous little app. Jamie Oliver uses several videos to explain a lot of common kitchen steps. I love how the recipes have step by step pictures showing all the different steps. This is a very well organized and helpful app, I look forward to 
__label__0 was not able to install because it asked for more mem.. even tho I have .8gig on internal and 10 gig on SD HTC EVO 3D
__label__1 App downloaded, installed and opened without a problem. This might actually help me figure out what to do with my kitchen.
__label__0 running on asus transformer. when i click on recipe it shows a big picture then force closes. this is when i dl the 80mb of media or not.what a tease!looking fwd to update that fixes this.will rerate when a fix come out.
__label__0 It's like having a cookbook on your phone. The problem is, if you're cooking, you're probably at home or at a friends house, and if this is the case, you probably have a better option than this anyway - the internet.Instead of being spoon-fed a limited n
__label__1 I first downloaded this early in the morning as I didn&apos;t want to miss this all. I love all of Jamie Oliver&apos;s work. \n\nAbout 7 hours of the 80 MB download not working I decided to uninstall and reinstall. While the initial download didn&apos;t

__label__1 I got this app from the market and paid for it.  It is a great app.  There are videos and recipes and shopping lists.I also love the tip videos on how to prepare steak and risotto.  If nothing else try it, it's free and once they fix whatever glitch peop
__label__0 Something very wrong with download on VZW Droidx.  Even with wireless it aborts the app.Might be nice if it worked.
__label__1 Works well on my TMobile-US based G2 (HTC Desire Z). It's really the content that makes it great, but the interactive recipes are presented in a great way.
__label__1 Downloads and installs on sd card nook color cm7. Videos are great - many useful instructions and hints - so much more convenient than my falling to bits cook books
__label__1 it's a good app probably equivalent to several (many) episodes of food channel. great and easy reference and videos. autorotate isn't working right on my gtablet, but that doesn't impede the usefulness.
__label__0 I haven't used this app in a week; I have restarted my device multiple times.Someone please explain to me why this needs to run in the background. Even after I force close, it starts back up a few minutes later. It is a f$*#%g cookbook!
__label__1 No download issues. Installed fine and even followed a previous reviewers steps of downloading the media from the menu after clicking download later.  Great pictures and directions.  NO FORCE CLOSE ISSUES.Try reporting the problems and a reboot before 1*
__label__1 Comprehensive, great tips. movies are fast, informative. Oliver I'd passionate about fresh food. Gives a pantry list of essentials and a list to go shopping with. Already learned 4 new things today in less than 20 minutes. Thanks Amazon and thanks Jamie 
__label__0 UPDATE:I downloaded and installed the update.  This time it was able to download the 80 megs of additional data without crashing.Alas, as soon as I tried to view a recipe, the app force closed.  It still has a problem with switching between portrait and 
__label__1 In spite of the reviews I downloaded this app on my Droidx. So far it's working well. It takes a lot of memory but it's a high-content, attractive app. Thanks Amazon for this great free app.
__label__0 Review from Toshiba Thrive 16gb.I wanted to really like this app, my sis would have loved it - and I could really use it.  I also RARELY give one star reviews.I have uninstalled, rebooted, installed the update, and this bad boy won't play any videos.  Be
__label__1 And I'm impressed. this Jamie fellow really seems to know what he is doing. he gives you a list of fine recipes ( easy also! ) and walks you through them in a clear, concise, manner. i thought it might be a bit gimmicky, but the pictures and videos are t
__label__0 App downloads fine, but then fails to install, like there's a problem with the install package. Please fix this........
__label__0 Hopefully this will get fixed. Force close on droid x gingerbread. I hope they send an update son to fix the issue.
__label__1 I ended up uninstalling because I couldn't figure out how to stop the app from ALWAYS running in the background and slowing down my phone. Probably my own problem.Buy I must say, I learned some great stuff from this guy. My favorite tip? Put your boneles
__label__1 This app is amazing. The recipes are soooo goood! And the app looks really good. Very easy to use!The fact that you even have videos makes everything more simple.
__label__1 I downloaded the app, with the extra 80 MB from the prompt, this morning onto my Droid X.  No problems with FC at all.The recipes look amazing, and I really like the hi-res pics and vids included.  The shopping list is a good feature as well.  I also lik
__label__1 this is a great app not just an app also a cooking guide. the steps are easy to fallow and the tips he gives are good for beginners. I like the setup of the app too, good one chef :D
__label__1 I was able to download the media content from within the app.  It all runs very smoothly and looks terrific on the Incredible.  I can&apos;t wait to try out some of the recipes.  The tip videos look terrific.
__label__1 I'm amazed at the quality of this app. I guess it should be expected for an $8 app though. only problem I have is I'm not sure if its downloading the additional media. No way to tell :-(
__label__1 Beautiful app. Recipes move between portrait and landscape when they should and no force close. Downloaded video from within app as others suggested and no problems.Can't wait to try them.
__label__1 I would have kicked myself if I saw this app having been free and not snapped it up. What a wonderful way to approach cooking instruction. Your cookbook is your shopping list is your cooking show is in your pocket. This may actually qualify as something 
__label__0 I tried installing this first on my Iconic tablet. Wouldn't load. Uninstalled. Reinstalled.  Nothing again. Tried installing on my Droid X. Couldn't get it to work on that. Videos would never load. Ingredients were missing...blah, blah, blah. Would have 
__label__1 Looks like it doesn't work on all phones, fortunately it does work on the HTC sensation. worth the download, especially for free, 7.99 would be a stretch though.
__label__1 I'm sad to hear about all of us having trouble with force closings.. it works perfect on the Incredible is all I can say to everyone who has one. the pictures and videos are beautiful!! I hope they do continue to develop this app so you all can enjoy it 
__label__1 People please don't rate this app as a 1-2 STARS because it doesn't work on your phone - unfair! I have EVO 3d and this program ROCKS! It is very intuitive, clear and easy to follow direction, great pictures and videos! Most comprehensive cooking program
__label__1 This app really helped me to get started cooking. As a college student, I&apos;ve been looking for a good way to learn to prepare healthy meals without spending hours and hours looking at recipes, tracking down ingredients, and then trying to make someth
__label__1 At first, the video downloads weren't downloading, but that seems to be fixed because the queued videos are downloading now.  Having said that, I've watched the Knife Skills, Preparing Garlic, and other vids and I'm impressed!  Jaime is talking and teach
__label__1 This is one of the more beautiful apps that I've seen, and is the type of useful app I would love to see more of. He makes cooking look easy and I found myself making a few recipes I would not have dreamed of trying without Jamie's help.It worked great o
__label__1 Wish he would add more videos.  I haven't used the recipes but I learned a ton just by watching his video tips.
__label__0 Does not work. I care not the reason why... I do NOT rate apps based on potential of how good they might be once fixed. The app was released in a broken condition do it gets rated in a broken condition!
__label__1 It's pretty obvious that a lot of thought and planning are in this app.  I followed completely through two recipes, with all the tips, etc. and feel confident that all of the app is of the same high standard I saw.This is perhaps the "slickest" app I hav
__label__1 They obviously put a lot of work in this and it shows.  This is really worth it.  If you aren&apos;t a good cook this will probably make you one at your own pace.  Takes you by the hand if you want or just use as a normal cook book with shopping list.
__label__1 Wow!  This is, by far, the nicest cooking app I've seen -- and I love that it's free today!  The recipes all sound and look delicious (the photography is excellent). Navigation is smooth and intuitive, ingredients and equipment are easy to find, and the 
__label__1 The video tutorials make it. Recipes look great and the shopping list makes it easy. I definitely recommend this for anyone
__label__1 Workaround? None needed. I enabled WiFi, answered yes to the introductory download, and it is doing its thing. Like most apps with large downloads, it doesn&apos;t want to do out over 3g. They should fix the fc, though, and replace it with a message abou
__label__1 Just wanted to let everyone know that this works great on my phone.  I'm looking forward to trying out some easy, healthy recipes from here.
__label__1 I didn&apos;t think I&apos;d be impressed with this app at first, but it didn&apos;t take long for that to change. This app has great recipes, great cooking tips, and great videos and pictures to help you along. You can create shopping lists based on the
__label__0 without outo rotate this is useless on tablets and mounts... and in the kitchen I can't recommend it till I can autorotate and use it on my kitchen mount
__label__1 This application does not deserve one star. This application is one of the few that actually uses the smartphone technology the way it was intended to be used.  Glad I downloaded it and reported it to amazon that there was a problem on their end which ca
__label__1 Jamie has great simple recipes that my whole family likes. this app is awesome with its what you need list for ingredients, and ability to add them directly to the shopping list. also change recipe for 2 or 4 people, and watch how to videos. great app!
__label__1 Great app. Gives you some really good ideas on what to prepare especially when you can&apos;t think of anything to prepare.
__label__1 Finally, a useful app!  I've got to be honest, I've grown tired of the games Amazon offers.  But, in regards to this app, all is good.  Videos run smoothly, no force closes.  So far so good.  Works perfectly on my MyTouch 4G running Android 2.3.4.
__label__1 This app works and looks great. I did not get the force close on droidx. I let the a 80Mb download complete and everything is fine
__label__1 I love to cook and bake and with Jamie's 20 minute meals I have some great recipes to cook on week nights that won't take a long time and my family can eat sooner.
__label__1 This is a brilliant app; part cook book, part cooking show, it is a perfect (or at least very very good) cooking app for a phone (or, I presume, a tablet). The videos are helpful and he has little audio hints at done steps in the recipes; all in all, ver
__label__1 To avoid the force close issue I told it to download the extra material later and chose manual download right off. When that was done the program opened fine. What a treat!  Awesome use of multimedia, beautiful presentation, excellent recipes and the pri
__label__0 I&apos;m having trouble installing this app on my 3g touch slide Froyo 2.2.1, so I emailed amazon about it. It&apos;s annoying to read one star reviews when the person probably never bothered to contact the dev\/customer support.
__label__1 I went ahead and downloaded this app, eventhough others were having issues. I'm glad I did.. It works perfectly on my Incredible 2. I love Jamie Oliver recipes, and this app is beautiful, and very informative.
__label__1 This app is really quite impressive. the graphics and user interface are beautiful alone, not to mention how useful the tips and videos are. I love this app
__label__1 they fixed all the bugs and it looks real clean and iPhone looking this is how I want all android apps to look.
__label__1 I&apos;ve been watching for this application since it came out! The user interface is easy, the recipes easy to understand, and I am looking forward to using this application on a regular basis.
__label__1 Love the idea.  The application has a very nice appeal to it.  Only problem is landscape view makes g2x go crazy but that's something an update can fix.  Just send feedback!!!
__label__1 Well done and organized app....Great recipes with good production values.. but beware.. Because it's video intensive, it requires an additional 80 meg of media files....The original 14.5 meg file as well as the additional media files go directly on the S
__label__0 This application would freeze on a regular basis. I find that just googling receipes is much easier then using a phone application
__label__1 He's a great chef and this is a great app for preparing some of his recipes. Easy to use and works well. However it is a large download - but worth it.
__label__1 I don't usually rate apps but felt compelled to let people know this app WORKS WELL on my EVO. Thanks!
__label__1 Love Jamie Oliver and his goals.  This app looks great on my nook color running cm7.  Would definitely recommend to anyone who wants a nice looking cooking app
__label__1 Big help. Check it out. Thanks amazon. I will surely use this app. Nice graphics. Not sure about 7.99 but it seems like it can be good.
__label__1 Good recipes, but more importantly, super-informative instructional videos teaching essential basic skills, such as the proper way to cut an onion, how to chop really fast and so on.There's also a shopping list generator which is really handy.
__label__1 I first reviewed this app and gave it 4 stars because it kept force closing when I tried to download the extra data, I tried downloading it connected to WiFi and it worked. I haven&apos;t had any problems since so I&apos;m revising my review to 5 stars. 
__label__1 The videos are awesome high quality and very detailed.  Various types of techniques demonstrated are well done.  I can say now no more fried baloney sandwiches for me!
__label__0 Needs to be updated, does not work on galaxy nexus or tablets (rotation is messed up, makes app unusable). Version on android market fixes these issues
__label__1 This is a very cool app. I&apos;ve never seen anything like it. The videos played very well on my droid x. With all of the photos, recipes, instructions, tutorials and shopping list I can see this app being used a lot. miss maybe 1 of the best apps amazo
__label__1 I do like this app altogether. I&apos;m using an HTC inspire 4g and every time that I&apos;ve used it so far it works consistently and correctly. I love the shopping list and it makes cooking up and shopping for a good meal even better then a piece of pa
__label__1 It works perfectly on my Droid running 2.2.2. Nice pictures and video. Don't know why other phones are having a problem with this.  I'm using the early Droid phone.
__label__1 I'm sorry, but I don't have 20 minutes to spend on a meal. Could Jamie put out a 17 minutes meal app? That's about all the time I have to spend on a meal. Thanks!
__label__1 this app is very useful because it helps me learn the ins and outs of cooking and being extremely organize icons. A lot of new techniques I learned was from this app. I highly recommend it
__label__0 Will not download additional 80 megs of information, it asks me and when I select now it does nothing then force closes the app. I can get download quied then nothing else.
__label__1 Works great on the EVO 3D. Awesome recipe app with step by step instructions and pictures at every step. Very cool for a free app of the day.
__label__1 It even has videos to supplement some of the recipes. For those people who are complaining about force closing or what not, you shouldn't complain and give the app 1 star because you have a crappy out of date phone that can't handle threw 80 mb. I have t
__label__0 I was forced to choose the 1 star because the reviews section does not allow users to choose ZERO stars because that is the honest truth about this app since this app does not deserve even 1 star but zero stars instead!The reason why I downloaded this ap
__label__1 works fine for me and its a pretty good app. would i have paid 8 bucks for it?  definitely not, but for a free app it&apos;s a great deal.
__label__1 This is what programs should strive to be. Organized and well executed. May be slower on older phones due to its graphic nature, but i had no problems with it. Only real complaint is the lack of total number of recipes, especially due to the ridiculous s
__label__0 Zolmo seems not to give a tinkers cu$$ about supporting Amazon with updates.. using with galaxy nexus causes repeated unsuccessful download even when app is uninstalled. 5 emails to developer... nothing. Do I have to pay them $7 to get the update on the 
__label__1 I love how easy this app is to use.  The photos, videos,  and step-by-step instructions are awesome. I had a FC when initially trying to download media.  I chose download later, then downloaded through the menu with no problem.
__label__1 The app is very polished, well thought out, and extremely easy to use. The videos are very informative, and the recipes are chock full of information, including pictures for every step. \n\nIt&apos;s also great that you can instantly add all the ingredie
__label__1 it is a really large app but its worth it if you have the storage. i have a Galaxy s so space wasnt really an issue for me. Slick UI, pretty snappy, and it has decent recipies. And its Jamie Oliver. He tried to make school food healthier but he for kicke
__label__0 the app looks fantastic but it is packed with glitches. it force closes as soon as you try to download the required 80mb download. it also force closes at random times. in addition it tells you that you don't have a licensed version and you need to buy i
__label__1 First off, I chose to download the additional content later.  This app is terrific. The layout is impressive. There is so much this app has to offer. The videos are helpful, the recipes are easy to follow and my favorite part is the apps ability to creat
__label__0 Opened application it stated it needed to download like 80MB of content then when I clicked on it fc,  if it is fixed then I will related it.
__label__1 HTC G2  Since they updated the app, it's running smooth now.  I love the recipes and the step by step instructions.  It's pretty much exactly what I wanted/expected from a "Jamie Oliver" cooking application.
__label__1 Improvements: move ' delete all records' in mpg screen from main screen to hidden menu. Add record export to cvs or similar (useful for business car expense tracking in quick books or similar)
__label__1 This app does what it says it does. It keep track, but still requires user input. Could use a little cleaning up, otherwise good though. Wish it had a widget instead of the notifications.
__label__0 Uses up battery by always running. YOU CAN'T TURN IT OFF!! How screwed up is that for a program like this? Quickest way to be uninstalled program by me is eat up battery (besides obvious not work or be malicious) and at least SOME of those will turn off 
__label__1 Really liking this app now that I've had it for a little while now. Wish I could tweak some stuff though, put more info. in and be able to get rid of things that I think really isn't needed. But for the most part it really does help you keep track of wha
__label__1 This is an easy way to keep track of everything on your car. Very often when getting an oil changed or any other service we are asked when the last time we changed our wiper blades or had a coolant flushed. Most of us scratch our heads and say, "yesterda
__label__0 Great app in theory, but as soon as I installed it and moved it to the SD card, my phone kept unmounting the card. And when I tried to move it back to the phone? My settings went bouncing back to the main screen. Uninstall. (Evo Shift)
__label__1 I actually use this app for tracking my MPG since my car doesn't have that feature built in. It calculates my MPG based on my last fill-up, which is more accurate than what some other apps offer. It saves me the trouble of doing this the proper way.The o
__label__0 This review won't be helpful since I never really used the app. I downloaded it and found it to be pointless for me.
__label__0 Glad I checked before updating.  The new version wants to 'discover known accounts'.  Worse,  and not sure if this is the fault of the dev or Amazon,  that perm doesn't show up on the install screen unless you tap to see more. Also see the update has tra
__label__1 This tracks EVERYTHING, including your gas mileage.  I like that it doesn't lock you into certain measurements, like changing your oil every three months or 3,000 miles.  I'm not a big fan of how it has you set everything based on both mileage and time b
__label__1 Simple to use. Highly customizable. The app provides suggested tone and mileage intervals for all maintenance, which makes it easy to get started with for those who may be less familiar with suggested maintenance. I also love the MPG feature. It may be a
__label__1 Been using this for a while and it does what it's supposed to.  I probably would have given it 4 stars until I had to rebuild my phone the other day and found that it had been quietly backing up my data to the cloud.  Without that, I would have lost all 
__label__1 Like the gas log feature!  Does all the work for me.  I've been using pen and paper for years on 4 different vehicles.  Too bad this wasn't around back then to help.
__label__1 App downloaded quickly, small file, and is transferable to SD card. Easy to navigate User Interface. It's not the flashiest looking app, but is super-functional. Only permission requested is to write to the SD card. Well worth $2.I'm excited to go into m
__label__0 I got this some time ago. I tried it. It was to limited for much of anything so I didn't use it much. After a month or so I decided I could better use the space it was taking up and uninstalled it.
__label__1 Fantastic little program. It takes care of your autos records. To the person or persons that wrote this program.....THANKS! Outstanding job.
__label__1 I use the app regularly to input the miles, gas price and gallons used. The graphs are great and I hope after couple of years the data will be very useful. I have used it for 1 year. I had to change my Amazon account, and when I delete the appstore it is
__label__0 6/11/2013 OK the backup didn't work, I had just backed it up that morning so all should have been OK. When I tried to restore it said that "SD card may not be available but import successful from an alternate external location". Sorry but it did NOT impo
__label__1 I diligently maintain my car records on this. It helps me analyze car problems and take preventive action. I think my car will last a bit more longer because of this app.
__label__1 Please make the oil change field allow set mileage changes other than the presets. Thats the only issue and I have tried a lot of these tupe of apps, this one is the best!
__label__1 Pretty much what I was looking for. Does everything, including customizable fields for each interval for those of us that don't go by the "recommended" everyday settings or those with older vehicles which require more frequent changes.
__label__1 The graphics are very good. The play is pretty easy to understand, but it does take some time to figure out what all the weapons and defenses are. This is a game you can play right from the start without a big learning curve. eventually though you get to
__label__0 Downloaded it as the free app of the day and only played it for like 2 minutes. It was very confusing and I didn't understand how to play or what to do
__label__1 boring boring boring boring boring boring boring boring boring boring boring boring boring boring boring boring I only put 5 stars cause I felt like it
__label__0 I think that this game is a waste of our hard earned money. This game disappointed me and my kids. I think that if you get this game, you will be mad.
__label__0 This game is kind of stupid.  It has no real point and is not fun to play.  I do not think it is worth the time to download
__label__1 I would highly recommend this to anyone who has a android phone. Me and my daughter play with this game all the time.
__label__0 The poor reviews for this app are warranted.  It is boring and there is no need for the permission it requires.  Skip it, Skip it,  Skip it.  Amazon has given us yet another dud in a long line of apps that are nor worth loading as the Free App of the Day
__label__0 come on amazon give us a decent free app...the ones on here latly suck! are you ever going to acually put candy crush saga app on here? does anyone from amazon acually ever read these comments?
__label__0 I don't trust this app one bit after looking at the permissions. Im not installing this on my rooted phone and don't suggest it.
__label__1 I took this to work one day and had a blast with it. Kids love it.  Specially if they are boys.
__label__1 Of all the Yoda Apps out there. This has to be the best one. You won't find this great of quality anywhere else. Best Yoda App I've seen. Thanks for the excellent App. Do or do not, there is no try! Now let's go do some yoga!!!
__label__1 Well designed and implemented. You should disregard hate reviews that should have been directed at Amazon's practices or selection of free apps
__label__1 so glad i remembered to check out the faotd today. this is a great find! i normally use tapes but sometimes i find it to be limiting. now i have no excuse to not do yoga when i wake up or go to bed! it is an awesome tool and i am excited to see how it wi
__label__1 I'm a beginner to yoga, and I find the beginner routines easy to follow and still challenging. Tip for true newbies: I watched the routine all the way through before I tried it the first time and tried out some of the poses. Made it much easier to follow
__label__1 Pocket Yoga is amazing. Whether you're on the go or at home, your own personal yogi is always with you! The practices are very customizable. Three types of practices are available: Ocean, Desert and Mountain. Each practice is tailored to a specific flow.
__label__0 Since in the origin of yoga each position represents a different named pagan god, it is not for me or my family. I'll stick to weight lifting and aerobics.
__label__1 My wife has this application on her iPhone. Looks to be a straight port,  which is a good thing. Although there are a limited number of sequences, they are pretty good for beginners to intermediates. But for much less than the price of one single yoga cl
__label__1 A great app to be able to carry around with you anywhere! Home, beach, office or traveling!I enjoy it and what it can do and offer!
__label__0 people have the right to an opinion.  there are multiple reasons to rate 1 star.  it doesn't just have to be based on how well an app works.  it can be rated based on how well you like the apps content.  read the rules of posting a review.as for my revie
__label__1 This is great!!  I've done the P90X Yoga a few times but it doesn't let me customize my workout.  With this, I can, and it can't be simpler to set up and follow.  My wife has about 10 exercise videos on Yoga but enjoys using this as well.  I wish more An
__label__0 this is crap,  if i wanna do yoga, ill do it with television  or in a gym,  very useless app if i ever saw one.
__label__1 First off let me say that I never had even thought of trying yoga before.  I was looking for a change in lifestyle, I wanted to be more fit and active and I made up my mind that I was  going to push myself to my physical limits. and as I must admit were 
__label__1 No excessive permissions and the app does exactly what it says...what more could I ask for?  Thanks for a good choice after yesterdays stinker...makes me only blame the weekend help now!
__label__1 This is a good app if you are interested in yoga.  There are lots of different posesI normally don't write reviews for the free app but the pagan and yoda morons made me compelled to write.
__label__1 This app is MAGNIFICENT!Pocket yoga combines Ashtanga and Pilates yoga disciplines and puts an excellent stress reliever or a good workout in your pocket.It's a great app and it will be on my phone for a long time.5 stars.EVO 4G 2.3

__label__1 does what it says, nice app for beginners; graphics are kind of retro-simple, they could have done pictures with real people .
__label__1 ...&amp; the losers who gave one star should crawl back into their holes &amp; stay there. What kind of moron gives one star just because they don't do yoga? If I didn't play video games, but got on ign &amp; started throwing out horrible ratings to grea
__label__0 One good free app, then ten lousy ones...Thanks amazon, we really appreciate your free app promotions(wipes sarcasm off face).

__label__1 Personally, I don't do yoga. But I hate that people are giving this app bad reviews simply because they don't like yoga. That has nothing to do with how good the app is! If you don't like yoga, leave the app alone! It looks to me like a pretty great litt
__label__1 Don't review an app if you have no intentions of even downloading it. Cool app for someone that enjoys yoga. Thank you amazon.
__label__1 very useful! is there really someone who gave this 1* because yoga positions are named after pagan gods?? what an idiot... i wish you could flag comments for stupidity
__label__1 I've never tried yoga before. I've been doing a lot of crossfit-style exercises and only downloaded this app hoping to get some flexibility back.  I love this app and I love yoga now. The app is great for beginners like me since it has a description of t
__label__0 way too big for what it is. there's no reason for something like this to even be bigger than 1MB.
__label__1 This is a great yoga app whether you are a beginner or an advance Yogi.  It's great for people that travel a lot, it's almost like having a Yoga instructor there right with you.
__label__1 Love it! just like a real yoga class and great for a beginner like me. has three different styles of yoga, three different levels, and three  different time amounts, which is great for my lifestyle.. 2 beginner level practices and I can feel it working a

__label__0 no thank you. I know its free and all but really? I think yall can do better. I mean yoga? fo reals?
__label__1 that's what happens when you empower idiots to write reviews. app is what it says it is. take it or leave it. its not going to make you a gangster. its exercise for the mind n body.
__label__1 I love yoga but my schedule does not allow me to go to yoga classes often. This app not only brings the classes to me it is also cheaper than paying for classes. It is easy to follow, and you can choose your yoga style, difficulty level, and how long you
__label__0 I actually paid for this app. It is totally useless because the measurements are inaccurate. total waste of money i deleted it.
__label__1 Another round of ridiculous reviews.  One star because you don&apos;t play golf?  One star because it won&apos;t help find your way home?  Gimme a break.
__label__1 Remember, the gps is only a accurate as your hardware. The app has a quick and easy to navigate interface and even allows for new courses to be added. They thought of everything!
__label__1 5-10-13 I finally loaded this app on a GPS phone and my opinion of this product is greatly enhanced. I now can take it with me to the course and use the features in real time, and I am very pleased.The yardages are always within a yard or two of my Garmi

__label__1 I m so happy with subtitles^^,\ni will test this app when i could step on the green.\nthanks for free and thanks for progress~!
__label__1 If you&apos;re going to a course for the 1st time then this app will be a ball saver. I used skydroid for a long time now and this one handles the hazards and overhead views better.  As for accuracy, gps will generally get you within 3-6 yards, I was alw

__label__1 This app is the best thing since sliced bread!  Some of you may know me, my name is Tiger Woods. Last week I fired my caddy because of this app. I don&apos;t need that bum any more because this app does his job much better than he did. \n\nNot only is go

__label__1 Love that I can play and play.....the payouts aren't everytime; but enough that you can stay on the game for a while and stay completely enthralled...5 Stars!!
__label__0 didn't work well on my Kindle Fire.  registration of numbers were way out of place.  Horse race ran forever and had to force it to stop and poker game missing some of its card numbers.  Sorry cant recommend this game and will be removing it from my Kindl
__label__0 I unistalled immediately after I downloaded it. There seems to be a problem with it running and crashed my kindle.
__label__1 There are various levels and even some free spins to boost your score.  You can cash out and apply your score to the next game .
__label__1 Have fun playing these games. Can become addictive very quickly. Told all my friends about these fun games. Slot of fun
__label__0 This US very boring. It might be worth playing if it rewarded the pocket change it promised but just like every other game or app that's download ed d from Amazon, pocket change doesn't work. Not worth downloading or taking up space e . On your kindle
__label__0 didnt like the game you might so give it a try. sometime people like stuff and i dont so give it a try
__label__1 good way to pass the time. cant seem to ever lose. i play whenever i have a few minutes of down time.
__label__1 this is a fun and addictive game once you start playing you wont be able to stop I would highly recommend this game
__label__1 I really enjoy this game but I like to gamble and I wish you could play more coins at one time. also you should have another bonus game that comes up besides killing the turkeys. I play the horse race and scratch the card and the other but you do not win
__label__0 Just more of the same old pay to play come on. You pay out and get nothing in return, what a waste of time.
__label__1 This game is a fun way to practice your betting skills. It starts out small, but it will get better.
__label__1 This &#34;Little Application&#34; is really a &#34;Big App&#34;It gives hours of pleasure.I love this game.It is just like a &#34;Casino&#34; on your Tablet.I would highly recommend this to all who like slot machinesGive it a &#34;10&#34; for the 777Try 
__label__1 ..Enjoy the game very much. Like a trip to Vegas in the middle of the week.. Recommend it too ALL my friend.
__label__1 Very fun, can't seem to stop playing, got the whole family not wanting to put it down!!!Very nice for a free app
__label__1 I play real slits fairly often and lose most of the time. This is realistic and you do not lose.
__label__1 At least in this free game, you win lots of (unfortunately) money!!! Lol.. well worth the download. Hope to see more as I go.
__label__1 This is a really fun app and keeps me entertained when I am not able to go to the casino.
__label__1 this is exactly what I was looking for! a lot of the other apps are confusing. I could do without the mini games though.
__label__0 i didnt like the app it was very boring and there are planty of apps that have the same concepts that are alot more fun. sorry hope that helped
__label__1 great reminder of how simple it was to write on original palm os devices.not as practical today with capasitive screens thou, kinda makes me wanna buy a capasitive stylis just to use this.
__label__1 I cut my PDA teeth on a Palm IIIe.  I recently acquired an enTourage Pocket eDGe dualbook, with stylus and resistive touchscreen.  This app works GREAT, and for someone who spent a lot of time entering text in PalmOS, it's MUCH faster and more ergonomic 
__label__1 To my knowledge, Graffiti was the first successful handwriting recognition for the masses.  It was popularized by the PalmOS of yesteryears.It has its shortcomings in that user has to adapt to Graffiti's sometimes quirky gestures.  But once user get over
__label__1 Now I can keep up with my daughter's typing speed, and she grew up with these gadgets!I mastered Palm's Graffiti years ago.  On my tablet, I just couldn't make my big fingers hit the correct key with any keyboard I loaded. Now it feels so natural.  I hav
__label__0 WHEN I TRIED TO SET AN ALARM IT KEPT GOING OF ALL THE TIME WHEN IT WASNT SUPPOSED TO. THIS APP. REALLY STINKS
__label__1 I tried other apps but this one has better options &amp; looks prettier.  Very versatile &amp; adaptable. However, I don't use the launch app option because it turns my volume off.
__label__0 Didn't work junk not worth the download skip past this one don't waste space on your hard drive try to find something else
__label__1 this app is a hiden gem within apps, its great as an alarm, it is very flexible and has tons of features all for free!
__label__1 traded phones and tried others, came back to this one.  You can set up your own ringtones for the alarm, easy to use.  all around best one for me
__label__1 Very easy to use. Highly customizable. Of all the alarm apps I've tried (there's been many), this is the very best by far.
__label__0 I tried and tried but no matter what I did I could not turn the sound off!! do not install this app it is a wast of time!
__label__1 Great tool. I have been using it for over a year now. Itallows you to use music. Set multiple alarms. Also you can have your device volume seperate from alarm volume.
__label__1 Love this app. I especially like the hourly grand father clock chimes, although for some reason it occasionally chimes off the hour.
__label__1 Only alarm clock that has ever worked for me on a regular basis.. no worrying about the volume being turned down on a clock radio, you can set it to wake you up to any song on your phone, or to an app (supposedly like the weather forecast, but I can't fi
__label__0 first I set it for 7 o clock then it woke me up but did not shut up so I deleted the app but it still has the alarm set and I don't know how yo turn it off.
__label__1 The people who are submitting bad reviews about this app are just like the people who are submitting bad reviews about the Kindle Fire. They spend about half a minute exploring the features and decide that it sucks, making false reviews with information 
__label__0 I got that app and it froze my kindle,and I try to shut it down but it wouldn't work I had to get a new kindle because this stupid app don't get it
__label__1 this is very helpful because I got to go to school (just saying I'm 9 so if I didn't spell some of the words rite sorry) but this app is so tottaly awesome.if I were you get it
__label__0 I downloaded this app thinking it would be great. I tried it out but it didn't make sound. u would recommend not getting this app.
__label__1 I used the ad-supported version of this app for about 3 days before I went out and bought the no-ad version; not just to get rid of the slightly annoying ads, but to support the dev for making an amazing alarm app.  I find it mostly impossible to get out
__label__0 I thought I would give it a try.Everytime I would set the alarm it would shut off or stop working.I couldn't get it off my Kindle soon enough!!!!
__label__0 installs and opens, but crashes when trying to edit an alarm. you can't use the app... i cant further review the app until this is fixed. Five stars when running on my Galaxy S II... :/
__label__0 I found it to be too obnoxious for me to deal with as an actual alarm, but I am looking into other ones that are similar.
__label__1 I love this app. the one thing YOU NEED TO MAKE SURE TO DO is when your setting alarm make sure you set the dismissal. to turn the alarm off you can simply press a button or do a math problem to turn your alarm off. it has.anbutton so that you can play y
__label__1 I really suggest you get this. its free and it still lets you use your music as a choice. and even more there's. setting where you can make it where you have to do math to dismiss it! clever
__label__1 I just wanted a basic alarm to set. I found some extra's that I didn't know I wanted. Love the nap button, and that I can adjust the snooze time.. Have this app on several devices.
__label__0 I hate it I hate it I can never set a single alarm and it always says that it cannot stay stinken open sunbathing don't get this app ever
__label__0 I was going to use this as a travel alarm on a recent trip.  Tried to set it up and test it before I went, but I couldn't find the snooze when the alarm sounded.  It may have been there, but I couldn't find a way to shut it down, so I uninstalled it.  I 
__label__1 The app is a great alarm, and has many customizable options such as selecting your own music to wake you up. There is an option to do math to dismiss the alarm.
__label__1 I have waisted a lot of my time searching for a list of all math formulas on a regular computer. And now here it is. I have found another app on kindle fire as well that I had never seen on the computer. What am I doing waisting my adrenaline on this rev
__label__1 I got this with the idea that it may be useful. It has everything damn near in it and explains some information about said equations.
__label__1 this app is what ive been looking for no nor paying tot a tutor for me keep up the good work
__label__1 If your having some trouble with math, then this is right for you.  The explanations are accurate and straight to the point.
__label__1 I have used many math referenceapps, but this is by far the best I have ever used on any market.  I figured I should make a positive review before I upgrade to the paid app.
__label__1 If you think this is no good because you can't practice, it says &quot;math REF&quot; not &quot;math practice&quot;. It shows you the rules like a good ref. If you're looking for hands on practice,  then look elsewhere because this only shows you whateve
__label__0 I wanted to help my math but I thought this app should help but no I want a 5th grade app that's free and actually helps
__label__0 Pretty pointless.  Unless you like putting thumb tacks in a wall.  Then maybe it's for you.  Random touches on the screen redirect your device from game play to advertising.  Not fun, not exciting, not funny... Uninstalled.
__label__1 this app is addictive~i cant stop playing it. i like to play mp3s in the background too, and when pinman gets tortured enough he twitches and it seems like he is in a lot of pain (idk if thats a glitch or not). the app works nicely on kindle fire :) and 
__label__1 Did you know that you can change the bscktound and make the guy wear a tuxedo! amazing right, I love this game my friend, Elis and I think.it is so funny. one time, he even fell over because he was laughing at this app.Get this app : Its really hard to g
__label__1 in my opinion this game is a load of fun you can make shapes attack a person even a stand in for your boss. I like this game because of the gyroscopic controls.
__label__1 it is the perfect time waster pointless and fun over all great app fast download u will want to get this app
__label__0 probably the worst most pointless game ever played. amazon should do something about developers reviewing their own apps. one goes on to say this is hilarious. laugh laugh laugh. B.S.
__label__1 I love this you can do lots of things I like throwing the shapes at him he gets all bloody buy it BUY IT!!!!!!
__label__1 I highly recommend this app to very angry people. Just pretend the pinman is your worst enemy! lol, this is also a very good time-wasting game:))
__label__0 this game was boring when I got it I thought that there would be levels or something I have never UNinstalled a game so fast if there was a 0 star I would give it to this game
__label__1 you get to pin a man with tacks and you can turn off the blood. and you can get shapes and throw it at him.
__label__0 this game is terrible you poke a little stick figure with a pushpin and that is all that you do it was a.waste of space and I deleted it because it was boring
__label__0 Until permission to open to the network is explained, I will not download this potential Trojan horse.The same program could easily be run as local only, so it's trying to do something.
__label__0 all you do is stick a pin in him, as many as you can fit. this gets boring quick. I think I played it once.
__label__1 this is perfect for taking out this guy as in killing him! this is a lot better than punching a sibling
__label__0 I expected this to bad a unique and fun way to waste time simarly to paper toss. but this was a very boring game without any real excitement or fun involved.
__label__1 Use your imagination to have fun. You can pretend like he is a guy who has a new power control or you anything you want.
__label__0 it wont even let me play the freaking game it does force close every time!!! it doesn't solve ur anger issues it make them WORSE!!!
__label__1 its really fun,but i mean the problem is that from time :o to time it gets boring.........oh! LOLZ! i didn't even try to make that face............anyway,buy it!
__label__0 right from the start I didn't like it, their was not much do do. Their was an add covering something in the bottom right corner.  I would not download it.
__label__0 With or without blood splattering turned on, the app gets old quick.  Perhaps if there were something other than geometric shapes to use, the dummy had texture instead of being a stick-like figure, there were some good sound effects,  and realistic blood
__label__1 Pinman is a fun fun game, which is great for letting out anger (especially with the blood). You can beat him with objects and pin him to the walls. The best part is, I wont get accused of murderer!!!
__label__1 I think this is great if you tap your guy you switch body's and you can switch map download this it is awesome and your gonna like it
__label__0 stupid there is an add in the corner blocking something on the kindle fire STUPID don't get it if you have a kindle fire
__label__1 My son cannot get enough of this silly app. It's very amusing and catchy. Maybe more background effects would be better.
__label__1 A fun game for when you're bored. Sure to get plenty of laughs from this! Also good for those days when you're really mad hahaha(:
__label__0 Every time I tried to play this game it did not open! Awful game I will never play this game again.
__label__1 I loved it! it was a total laughing matter me and my bff loved it also if you are stressed or in a happy or giggly mood go ahead and give this a tap. :)
__label__1 Well, when I was in Idaho to see my cousin I brought my kindle fire with me and he played this game for hours.
__label__1 I love this app.I play it all the time,literally. If you get this app you wont be sorry you did.
__label__0 I want a job as a fake reviewer. id do a much better job than whoever wrote these fake 5 star reviews!! best game in appstore? grimmer a break. u don't even do anything.. there is no point. try rope n fly. same throwing a guy around.m but that one has a 
__label__1 My brother looked at me playing this and then he laughed and laughed and laughed and laughed, he wouldn't stop laughing at all. So it is good for all ages, gives you so many giggles. I am still laughing!!!!
__label__0 Amazon seems to have undergone some  change in management that has led to the site being flooded with revolting content.  What happened?  Oh - greed.
__label__0 THIS APP SUCKS I TRYED TO PLAY IT ON MY KINDLE FIRE AND IT KEPT SAYING PINMAN FREE HAS STOPPED.
__label__0 this app is useless. it is slow moving and really has not point. I have since removed from my device its not worth the space it takes up
__label__1 The ad covers another ad. Stop crying, or I will personally rip out your spines. This is a great app. Its even better at taking out anger.
__label__1 Look this is a awesome app. kindle fire users get rid of blood and u get rid of he ad
__label__1 BEST game EVER reeeaaalllyyy good on the kindle fire best pass time 2 its a funny 2 I play it ever day and STILL lol
__label__1 hillarous, funny, addicting, you want put it down trust me you wont I couldn't put it down it was reccomend to me I'm glad I got it
__label__0 The guy just flops to the ground, like a rag doll, and you drop stuff on him.  Really?  Not for me.  No cathartic pleasure here.
__label__1 I love this game! The perfect app to pass time on the toilet. It's also great to just sit and pass time!
__label__1 Gave Kindles to my kids for Christmas.  They love to download free Amazon apps for their entertainment!  They enjoyed this app.  My favorite part... It's FREE!!!  It's pretty gruesome, but funny... Thanks Amazon!
__label__1 I loved pin man because you can take out you're anger and not get in troudle for hitting some one
__label__1 I love this app I like to change him to the tux stick man and pretend to ruin a prom, ITS AWESOME GET IT NOW
__label__0 Terrible game, I say. I thought this might be interesting so I got it, but all it ever does is crash. Once it performed a glitch, then crashed again. Also, check out the permissions. I suggest that you not buy this game.
__label__1 I love this app I had it for about 1 year before I Thot about reviewing it but any way this app is great for trips and sucked when your board and stuff I think it is at least
__label__0 this isn't even fun oft has no point there is just a ty and you pin him.to the wall and you can drop stuff on him i didn't like it at all i uninstalled it fast
__label__1 Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool. Was I suppose to say something else?
__label__1 you guys are gonna rate it 1 star because you cant see an ad your freaking dummies what of there is no ad what if its inappropriate for kids retards like you guys get on my nerves
__label__0 its a piece of CRAP!! i love this game but evey time i presz start it says app has stopped working!! IT SUCKS!!&gt;:(HELP!!
__label__1 I would like to ask the general public what the price of the paid version is. if you have purchased it inform me on how much it is because a cannot retrieve the paid version of it using the search bar and in the ad section of the screen right before it s
__label__1 super super SUPER super super supper super game play for anger issues hay did you find the mistake yet? yeah you found it didn't you
__label__1 Such a simple concept. The price is right.  The game is fun. Younger kids especially think it's funny.Works great on kindle fire HD. Doesn't have any sound that I noticed but doesn't really need sound.
__label__0 i tried this game, and i find it absolutly terrible! i suggest u dont get this game cuz its just plain bad!
__label__0 This is so dumb, I wish my son never would have seen it.  I thought there would be some point, no just throw a guy around, try to pin him, and add some blood to make it worse!
__label__1 As soon as I opened the game, I knew that it would be very funny. I don't mean to sound evil,  but I had a WONDERFUL time TOURTURING the pin man. I hung him by his head, his leg, his arm, and pinning down every part of him and tickling him. NOBODY COULD 
__label__1 funny...i sit in boring meeting and it never fails to amuse me and others sitting next to me...a real keeper
__label__1 it is a real time killer. if your bored. you can turn of the blood if little kids are watching you.
__label__1 This app if u r under 13 years old get parents permission depending on ur parents.  So ask parents no matter what  it's fun to mess with the guy if u tap the guy on the start screen  he changes appearance. U can have fun messing with the stick guy I do p
__label__0 On my Kindle Fire HD this app won't work. When I open the app it says 'Pinman Free has stopped' every single time. It's not worth your time to decide if you want to get this app for your anger issues, download and install, and then end up with an app tha
__label__1 This game is AWESOME!!!!!!! it helps me take my anger out and is fun torturing the little guy bug this app
__label__1 this is a great game and it helps with anger. just imagine its a person you hate and boom solved
__label__0 this app Sucks because I don't get to play the game because it force closes every time I try to get on
__label__1 I love this app, but a note to the creators, for about 5 seconds there was a glitch that made my little pinman have a seizure, and that was the funniest thing ever!! You should take that glitch and incorporate it so when he gets all bloody, he starts flo
__label__1 this app is the best, I couldn't stop.  one time I glitched a square through his head and it looked like he had a square head. he also did an awesome backflip. I give it 5 stars.
__label__1 awesome!!! when u r at the start screen,drag you finger across it for a new backgroung!great anger management game and great for just every day.
__label__1 dude everybody who hasn't played this game you should play it or your lost come on you should get this app for your tablet.
__label__1 good if u r mad at someone, it calms you down and burns out the anger. didn diendone sonfpg doeo
__label__0 it would help if the game would actully start up because every time I do it say pinman has unexpectedly stopped working
__label__0 this doesn't deserve any stars...whether you have the blood option turned on or off it makes you flinch. i don't like it at all. don't waste ur time with this...no offense...
__label__0 I was so confused it was not funny. idhdhbcbchdhhshdvc.  ffhhrjfjdhfbbdb dhdhdbgdhevdvvdbxhd dh d hf hgf ddvvdvd dgggf dhhdhd dhdhfhhr ddhgggdvd dhdhhdrhf
__label__1 every time I get pissed off I just hang the dude and make him bleed its awesome I make him have a spasm
__label__0 I cant beloved some people accualy like this game if I could give it a negative 12345678901234567890 I SOOOO would. so FYI: DONT GET THIS GAME
__label__0 it was rlly boring nt worth the download hope u dnt download it bcuz it was super boring n dumb
__label__1 Daughter really enjoys this game and it is free to kindle fire owners.  I feel that this game might not be good for younger users because of the fake looking blood.
__label__0 This product does not run on my kindle no matter how many times I have tried to install it. Terrible product. Fix this!
__label__1 it is awesome , so fun you can have either one with blood or not, you can change the clothes(office man or not) , if you click the pin and touch the dude you can pin the guy to the wall, and if you click the + you can add shapes and hit the guy with them
__label__1 I love this app! you can &quot; pin &quot; him down by arm or legthen poke him in the tummy!  and you don't getaccused of muder!I would highly reccomed getting this app.
__label__0 this is not an ok game.  my kids didnt liked it and they played it a little.  then got bored with it.
__label__0 This game doesn't work on my kindle fire I pressed start and it says pin man has stopped I hate It I hate it I hate it and besides it makes my screen turn black and white and there's nothing I can do its and it deleted all my apps so now I have to 're do
__label__1 it is a little gross but u can turn off the blood it is also hard 2 pin the man in the begining. But it is so much fun. I recommended to kids older than 12 because of the graphics.
__label__1 Wat's with all those bad reviews? this game owns!  i once covered the guy completely in blood. one of the best free apps!
__label__1 this is a great game. don't listen to people who say it sucks. you can beat the life out of him. you can make stuff apear and beat him with it.
__label__1 This game us cool. What you have to di is pin the the man and you can also use squares, triangles, rectangles, and circles. And if someone is watching you , you could just turn off the blood. I rate this game a five star.
__label__1 Its an awesome app!! Its funny and entertaining and a wonderful cure for boredom!! U can add different shapes into theroom with your stick man too. You can also turn off the blood for little kids!!
__label__1 this game is very fun for a time killer. turn off the blood when little ones r around though. the only thing is that they shood add something to make it even better
__label__0 I knew this was a &#34;bad taste&#34; APP but thought it would be good for laughs.  It would, except it doesn't function as expected.
__label__1 great game for when your mad or if you have anger issues (Wich i I don't.) but it is a good time waister.
__label__1 This app is absolutely fantastic. I don't think I've exercised this much in my life! I've never found the motivation to do any of these exerxises, but this app shows you how to do the moves correctly, and there's no super skinny chick smiling and yelling
__label__1 I LIKE THIS APP A LOT BUT THE VOLUME IS VERY LOW AND HARD TO HEAR EVEN WHEN YOU ATTACH SPEAKERS.
__label__1 Excellent tracking device to monitor your workout progress as well I as your specific excercise program.  Can easily be customizied.
__label__1 I've lost 12lbs since Oct. 15. Works for me. I would tell all to get this. You can make it as easy as you need it. Then go rouge and get crazy. It's fun and keeps track of all you do. 6 Stars
__label__1 This app has helped me try new things in the gym and switch up my routine. I would recommend this for any android user!!!
__label__1 Fast paced enough to keep me interested. I love this app. I have a really hard time finding motivation but this is going to be on my kindle from now on. I actually enjoyed it and felt accomplished when I was done. Can't say enough good things about this 
__label__0 if considering purchasing this app dont because it is a waste. it just list what exercises to do with little explanation. It contains exercises that are common and easy to do.
__label__1 I have worked as a physical education treacher and a personal trainer. I thought this app was the next best thing to having a trainer and getting dressed to go to the gyn and take a class. I'm pretty fit, but get like I had a great workout when I used th
__label__0 doesnt give you a real workout  and is very blurry and does not make any sense at all so dont get it
__label__1 I have tried all of the alarm clock apps because it is an important one. So I found that his has been my favorite out of them all. It is the most reliable and user-friendly, with plenty of options but not so many that it is overwhelming. This is always i
__label__1 It's replaced my physical alarm clock. I really like that it tells you how much sleep you will (or won't) be able to get before the alarm sounds.
__label__1 this app is awesome. type w.e you want it to say for u to wake up . loooool creepy. but its cool. GET. IT. NOW. I WILL BE HERE TILL YOU GEDDIT. GODDIT?  K...,........ Are you installing it?!!!!! you better be!!!!! ............
__label__1 perfect app for busy moms. would like it if added ability to have alarm repeat monthly and every 2 weeks not just daily, weekly and yearly. there seems to be a glitches where it reminds next alarm when certain apps are added or opened. but overall best a
__label__1 I have used this app for a few weeks now and I like it.  I really like that I can decide what the alarm says.  Try it I tkink you will like it as well.
__label__0 Worked well for a week then would only alarm when it wanted. Should have listened to other reviews and I wouldn't have been late for work. Going back to my good old reliable cell phone alarm.
__label__1 The voice alarm is loud enough on the Kindle Fire which is known to have weak volume overall. It's very handy to have an alarm that can tell you WHY the alarm is going off in the first place. Then, of course, there are the endless possibilities for humor
__label__1 This app was perfect for easy setting, and my whole day is timed with alarms, right up to 8:00 PM when it goes off for the last time of the day, so I can find it (used to lose it once a day). Then it starts all over at 4:45 am....
__label__1 This app does everything that it is supposed to do.  It works fine on my Kindle Fire.  Remember to put your Kindle to sleep (not off) to save battery life.
__label__0 This app has a few serious issues. First and most serious, I could not access any of my wireless networks reliably while this app was installed. Second, the app (for whatever reason)  would randomly announce the next alarm time. This can happen while sle
__label__1 you can set lots of different ALARMS/reminders and it will alert you by voicing the text u input into the alarm.  PURE AWESOME. Not always telligible but giving this the full 5 stars because some doufus reviewer gave it 1 star a few days ago.
__label__0 I have a kindle fire. I got this so I was able to wake up in the morning without having an obnoxious sound every morning. I got this so I was able to come up witb a better way. This was a waste of battery. I lost so much on battery and it wouldnt uninsta
__label__1 There are not enough words about this app.  It's so easy to use, and keeps me on time for everything. Having an app talk to you is fantastic! Waking up to it is so much better than other alarms.  Everyone at work that has seen/heard mine has gotten this 
__label__1 highly addictive.  I love playing. quick and easy. onlineand off. great for memory and concentration.  great for any age. easy to learn.
__label__1 I love how this game can provide many hours of fun-filled challenges!!!Definitely recommended to someone who enjoys a challenge!
__label__1 Awesome app, really fun time waster because there isn't any goal in it. I play it all the time because it makes time go really fast.
__label__1 This game is supper fun you should all try it. If you need to waste some time play this supper fun game
__label__0 I guess I am just stupid because I don't know how to play. I clicked how to play, but if you don't  have alarge screen it's too small to read.
__label__1 I loved this game as a kid and still do. this is a great electronic version of an old time classic.
__label__1 Like so many others remember this fondly from childhood.  Really great game for phone.  Nice for quick break.  Thank you!
__label__1 This game is very addictive &amp; brain stimulating.  Would recommend it highly.  Easy to learn &amp; had different skill levels.
__label__0 don't get it it is a waste of ur time it has no point to it wat so ever so I'm telling u don't get if is waste ur time
__label__1 Great brain exercise game. Start out easy and work your way up to expert. Solving the code is different each time you play, so it never gets old. Good for teaching kids about logic.
__label__1 This is just like the game Mastermind that I used to play, and now I have gotten my children into it as well.  There are 3 different difficulty levels and the games are short, so it is perfect for passing time while waiting in a line.
__label__1 It isn't too hard and is good for a lite challenge. Since, the response dots don't correlate to the dots on the board, you can never be sure you are right. The game is pretty self explanitory, so even beginners shouldn't have too hard of a time winning.
__label__1 I'm running the free version currently and having no problems with it on my kindle fire. I loved playing this with friends years ago. I used to have it on my Pc until windows 7 came out and my game was no longer compatable. So I'm enjoying this on my kin
__label__1 this is such a fun game and addicting game. I was surprised about how challenging this game was. its actually harder than ya think.
__label__1 If you can logically think out your next move, this is a great game. If you just want to punch in colors willy nilly, you should skip this game and play something simpler.  Don't give the game a one star rating because you didn't read the brief instructi
__label__1 I am not what you would call a gamer.  I would much rather read or crochet.  One night this little game caught my eye and I thought I would give it a try.  Two hours later I couldn't figure out where the time had gone.  This game is fun and a bit of a ch
__label__1 It reminds meof the game mastermind. It's a fun quick playthat relies on logic to crack a code.
__label__1 This game will challenge your mind and make your brain think. There's different levels for different levels. You and your family will love this game.
__label__1 Tons of fun. I had forgotten just how much!No issues on kindle fire. Smooth and intuitive. Easy to learn, great for the kids.
__label__1 downloaded on my Kindle Fire and it is fun, not too hard but makes you have to think a little. Enjoyable way to pass time and it works great on this device.
__label__1 you can change the difficulty within each level by changing the settings. either have it repeat colors or allow blank spaces or not. I enjoy playing
__label__1 I really like this game its lots of fun my little brother (9 years old) loves to play it too
__label__1 this is a great brain teased game. really makes you concentrate and use a lot of reasoning and logic.  would recommend. to everyone.  can be addictive
__label__1 I love this app! It really makes you concentrate. I highly recommend it, you will not be disappointed or bored.
__label__1 a fun remake of master mind, or so I've heard. I enjoy never the less and I'm glad I got it.
__label__1 One of my favorite games; love games to stimulate my brain. If you are not a person to sit and analyze things, don't bother. This takes a lot of thinking. If you like to use your brain give this one a go!!
__label__1 I love this app. Going to buy the pro version. Helps me relax in evening. Happy when I suceed in knowing the placements of the colors in short time. Lets me know my intuition is in tune that day. Plus it's just fun! ;).
__label__1 I am always glued to this game! Whenever I play it, I never lose! Once you play ot for a while, you get the hang of it. My parents can't even figure this game out, even after I explain it and I show them the directions! But it's perfect for my kind of br
__label__1 This game is a great brain game and never gets boring.  I'm having too much fun to go to the MEDIUM and HARD levels but I'm sure I'll get to them eventually.  My husband is not too thrilled with it but I think it's because he gives up too easily.
__label__1 If you liked Mastermind you'll love this game in which the computer pegs for you. You don't have to be concerned about your opponent pegging incorrectly.  You can guess five colors, like Mastermind, or three or four for an easier game.
__label__1 this game is awesome!!!! it is so much fun!!my brain hurts when I play it....but....it is SO much fun!!!:{)
__label__1 i absolutely love this game... if you are a person that likes mind games, this game is for you. its not too difficult but it keeps you thinking.
__label__1 Nice version of Mastermind game.  I like that it has three levels and the graphics look very pleasing to the eye.  I just wish the clue pegs' colors were a bit more vivid because it's a bit hard to distinguish between the grey and the white sometimes.
__label__1 i LOVE this game! there is a board game version of this game, which  i have been pleying my whole life, and this is exactly the same thing!  this app is awesome!!!  if you dont have this app,  GET IT!!!!!!!
__label__0 Oh, how I hate this game! I mean, the other games they produce are enjoyable, but this, it's an unenjoyable one.
__label__1 when looking for apps to play on a long car ride this one fits all the requirements. including the fact that it doesn't need wi-fi. this is one of my favorite games and it is a great app
__label__1 This game is a great game to play anywhere. It does not need Internet access. That means hours of fun.THANK YOU GET
__label__1 I like it most because the hints on the side are different ppatterns everytime so u really have to use ur Brain I LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
__label__1 This is a fun game. The different levels allow anyone to play, and the hard level is a nice challenge.
__label__1 I saw this game when I first got my kindel, and I wanted to try it out, and it was fun! I absolutely love this game. crack the code is easy for me. yes I have lost a lot of times.....but ive won some too. either way its really fun. u should get it.
__label__1 this game is super fun! especially on the kindle fire so I reccomend to buy it. very good! Go ahead buy it you know you want to! :)
__label__1 I really enjoy this game. It's a great brain teaser and is easy to navigate this app. I recommend this over angry birds, fruit ninja, or any of the many other mindless games out there.
__label__1 Reminds me of Mastermind from years back. Great program works well have fun with it. Helps keep the mind sharp and the logic going.
__label__1 I love this app it is a challanging game of skill and fun. this is so a five star game people!!!!!
__label__1 As a young boy, I loved the board game &quot;MASTERMIND&quot;.This game is just like it, except it has two great advantages.#1- PLAY VS. CPU:  You don't have to beg your completely uninterested older sister to play the game with you!#2 - VERSATILITY:  Yo
__label__1 I like the ability to change difficulty. I can either challenge myself a lot or a little. My young children even love to try cracking the code!!!!
__label__1 this game is easy and fun its so fun my sister got the actual game at the store I defently recommend this game--Julianna
__label__1 its actually a game that makes me think it finally a game that does what it say its gonna do
__label__1 It is so easy and pretty addicting because I think I played it 20 the first day I got it.
__label__1 I really like the old Mastermind game, and this is an excellent version of the game. I has never played with pegs missing, so I got something new from this version of the game. Excellent work!
__label__1 Excellent game, very challenging to the mind and is entertaining to all age groups from age 10 to age 70.
__label__1 I am amazed this mastermind clone is free. It is incredible and I am convinced.it will help your overall thought process. Don't discount it based on the fact that it is a game or inexpensive.  It is a mind gym.My wife loves this. She has a masters degree
__label__1 This game is everything advertised! It may lack diversity in codes, but still worth it. Highly recommend to anyone who enjoys a bit of a riddle :)
__label__1 really a fun game never played this type of game before so I was pleased with every aspect of the game 5 stars
__label__1 This version is awesome. Keep doing great games. Always like this mind challenging games, instead of killing animals and/or other human beings.
__label__1 Just like Mastermind.  Simple, but very distracting and--I find--relaxing.  Works great on my kindle fire; no problems that I've noticed.
__label__1 I love this game! It's challenging but not so much that it isn't fun. You can play it over and over without getting bored.
__label__1 This game is enjoyable. For all you smarty pants who like puzzle games this one may be for you. Good exercise for the brain and an easy way to pass the time. Glad there are different levels the game works for many age groups.
__label__1 Like all of Optime Software's games, this is a great puzzle. Solve the code to win the game. Sounds easy, right? Oh, what little you know ;)A big bonus is the &#34;color blind&#34; feature, for those of us who have trouble with subtle shades.
__label__1 This is the game I played with my children.  My 4 year old granddaughter loves to play this on my kindle.
__label__1 As a kid, we played Mastermind in our house for hours and hours. I loved the deducing of it all and when it all came together quickly, voila! I love that I can play this as a solitaire game, select the level (depends on the number of pegs you want to gue
__label__1 this is cute and fun for kids and smart ones.I say its a mind bender because its difficult to figure out Wich color goes where. I would definitely recommend this app to a friend.especially because I love mind bender's.have fun:D
__label__1 I loved this game when I was a teenager, I'm so happy to be able to play any time I want to.
__label__1 This game is just like mastermind and is a lot of fun. very addicting to play and easy to learn.
__label__0 DIDNT GET THE KNACK OF THIS GAME AT ALL..IT HAS NO SENSE OF ANYTHING, GIVES NO FEELING OF ACCOMPLISHMENT NOR IS IT EXCITING ..ITS POOR
__label__1 Love this version of Mastermind game I played years ago. Great graphics, 3 levels. Plays without issues on my Samsung note 2.
__label__1 When I was little, I would pester anyone I could into playing Mastermind for hours on end ...and now I can play this by myself. :) Was so happy to find this app! The game is deceptively simple yet challenging - try it!
__label__1 If you like Mastermind you'll love this. Easy and pleasing interface, multiple difficulty levels, no bugs on the kindle fire.
__label__0 do Not even look at it!! it is soo bad!!  even my sister who love anything you put in front if her didn't. like it. such a lame game!!  :(
__label__1 This is awesome! This challenges your brain, but its fun as well!! This game is so addicting that even if you are troubled, you still keep going :)
__label__1 its amazing how often I feel like a complete knucklehead with this game but I keep coming back for more! a lot of fun and a great brain game.
__label__1 This is a very entertaining game. Not too difficult but still makes you think a bit. There are different levels for different skill levels.
__label__1 Much fun without a lot of fuss. The ads are less intrusive than I feared too. Good one that works well on the Fire.
__label__0 It is confusing. I mean, I followed the instructions and all, but it was still confusing. You couldn't guess the code at all!!
__label__1 It's right from the old days of Mastermind. I can understand why some folks are giving this a bad review. I guess they just aren't up for the mental challenge.
__label__1 I used to have this game in plastic form (Mastermind) and would play it with my son. It's not hard, but makes you think. Great for a free app.
__label__1 This game is a brain teaser. I love it, love love it. This is a great game. i cannot stop playing it. I would encourage anyone to buy and play this game, especially if you want to keep your brain stimulated. GREAT GAME.
__label__1 Crack the code is fun. I feel smart after reading these reviews. Puzzles, codes are like knots fun to untangle.
__label__1 I love this game and so do my friends.it is a good game for people who like puzzles :)this a really fun game
__label__1 I know someone says this is imposssble but it'd not. its a fun mind game. and it is amazing on the kindle fire.
__label__1 I got my game for free and thought it would be boring.  I was surprised on how I got caught up into solving the code. Its good for passing the time. I even got my husband hooked on the game :)
__label__1 Never thought I'd get hooked on this game.  Helps you think critically hence I won't consider it as a total waste of time.  On the contrary it may be a good brain exerciser.
__label__1 I played Mastermind with my sisters when I was younger and I never could figure it out.  Now as an adult, I can sometimes get the 3 colors right. Ha, ha!  Still working on my patience and focus to figure out the solution. Definitely worth having for the 
__label__1 I love this game and it is fun to play but it takes a lot of skill and it is like a mind twisted. Do you want to get you brain ready to think? Take a turn at playing the game.Ttyl peace out detectives code crackers!!!!! :)
__label__1 i love this app. I always played this game on my Pc and now I can play it all the time. strongly recommend.
__label__0 dont get this game it is totally rigged even if you do get the code right they say that it is wrong
__label__1 this is a fun application to play when you are bored. it is a simple and fun game based off of some math games. it runs smoothly on kindle fire!
__label__1 This is a perfect app if you want to keep your mind active or even just passing time. Highly recommended for people who want to have good mind exercise.
__label__0 I love puzzle games that make you think., but this game was just boring.  after a couple of levels I just deleted it
__label__1 finally something thag requires logic! lol one of the few games where I am challenged to THINK! I love it. plain and simple:)
__label__1 good game... keeps your brain sharp and fun too! only use medium level because that is what the original game has.
__label__1 This game is very fun. I tried to teach my teacher to play but then she wouldn't give it back.
__label__1 great for flexing your brain. the easy level is still a challenge for me, but this is a great opportunity to exercise logic skills.
__label__1 This is such an addictive game!  It really makes me have to process my moves. My memory is getting bad and my Doc told me that this kind of activity will help me to retain it. I love it!
__label__0 don't buy it. its a waste of time and its LITERALLY impossible to crack the code. Even on EASY! I would rate this a zero if I could.
__label__1 love playing this game. good for problem solving and thinking. Its nice for everyone. it can be tricky but that's the pint right?
__label__1 This is how I remember playing the game years ago.  The game looks great on the Kindle fire.  I would have picked another color than black to indicate that the color chosen was correct and in the proper spot.
__label__1 It works great on my kindle and is VERY addictive! I suggest you to get it I love it a lot!
__label__1 a fun and quick test of your powers of deduction. it encourages critical thinking. and can be fun for the entire family.
__label__0 I don't like it its boring its hard its tricky its something that makes you want to puke don't get it waste of life sorry if you got it that's why I only gave it a star if you want respond to this comment I'm sure you will do.t get the app
__label__1 I discovered thisbst my grandmas house and loved it but I didn't. think id be able to use it ever again till I found this. app. I play it all the time. YAAAAAAY!!!!!!!!!
__label__1 Just like the game Mastermind I played when I was a kid. The different levels made it easy to get back into it.  Very addicting!!!!
__label__1 Thank you so much for this app!  I love the new challenge each time I play!  I love playing at the hard level and I can usually guess by the 9th try but there's been enough times that I've gone all the way to the 12th!  And of course I've had my share of
__label__1 Amazing way to kill time if you are goingbon a trip or even if you are just going home! :)
__label__1 this is such a simple &quot;figure out the combination&quot; game that i CANNOT  believe how addictive it is!! good &quot;time killer&quot;. personally though, i haven't lost a game yet!
__label__1 My ten year old loves this app as much as I do. It is so much fun. Easy to use too. I have played for hours.
__label__0 Thought this would be a challenging game, but the rules left me just guessing.  It wasn't fun, just frustrating.  If someone can tell me how to play, I'll try again, otherwise...
__label__1 Solve the sequence in which the beads of color appear. Harder levels give you less opportunity to waste guesses. It's a game of deduction, and hones your ability to read between the lines.
__label__1 This game is both mind boggling and fun. I love playing this type of game.Its great! Its like the real board game mastermind which I love playing so this is even better!
__label__1 I've always loved Mastermind and was looking for an app to imitate the game. This was it. Even better, it has levels of difficulty. Easy to use, and no problems with it freezing or not working properly. Worthwhile download.
__label__1 This is a real great game. Just as I remember as a kid. Works well on Kindle Fire.  Definetly would recommend.
__label__1 This game is very good for learning logic and reasoning.  l would recommend it to all ages, young and older alike.
__label__0 i hate this one
__label__0 This is not a game. You follow directions and are told that you've followed directions. There is nothing that you'd recognize as gameplay. If you initiate a &#34;battle&#34; you are informed of the outcome, you don't even get a graphic representation of 
__label__1 probably the best uken game available, plus its free. I mean really how much more awesome can it get? if you like futuristic d&amp;d style rpg games then this game is for you. (a son's reveiw)
__label__1 You won't get flashy graphics or even BGM with this title but it is a spectacular game none the less. VBetween leveling up on missions, you can aqquire properties that generate cash used to heal and buy weapons. You can attack other marines on the battle
__label__1 a good way to wast your time.good graphicsfun for the hole familyjust get your level up :) :)
__label__1 This is a free social media style game that my wife and I both play on a nearly daily basis, more often during the weekly tournaments. If you want to check it out, be sure to join us in alliance so you can win more fights and advance further in the missi
__label__1 this thing is awesome you should also play the others they are awesome i love them soooo much. i can play it for hours
__label__1 This is a game that you will like if you can wait for a long time. Other than the waiting, it IS a good game.
__label__1 I love this app even though I just got it last night. Best game ever! get this app by all means
__label__1 Uken. I have a big problem I have had this game for a long time and like it a lot. But when I updated it here in the app store it updated it but made me start over at level 1 not sure what to do??
__label__0 ITS JUST A COPY OF FORCES OF WAR!DONT BUY IF U ALREADY HAVE FORCES OF WAR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! we. ed edd Shasta xbcc
__label__0 I though this game was gonna be like Supreme Commander or Halo Wars or something but you don't do nothing but push a button and watch the results. It's boring, honestly I think this is a bad idea for a game thumbs down.
__label__1 Usually the lack of animation in games like these turns me away but with dg there's so much under it I barely notice. add me auubn
__label__0 I have downloaded two games made by the author any guess what? they were identical but with a fifteenth theme and name and by reading the description on this on id say its no different. my advice uken? stop parodying your own games!!!
__label__1 to be completly honest, this is a great game. doesn't get old fast like a lot of games do these days. it is a must play in my opinion. download and enjoy people. AMAZING IS WHAT YOULL SEE
__label__0 Some games should not be classified as games...not much to do, confusing and boring.  Give it try, graphics are decent but I just couldn't get into it.
__label__1 love this game, very easy to play no bugs or force closes, opens and plays just fine everytime no problems
__label__1 don't get me tong forces of war is realty good but this is just like it. unending makes games like this they are all good but sometimes to much
__label__1 I never got this game but I wanted to tell you that it is the same thing as Forces of War.
__label__1 Yet another good timekiller! This one has space! They need to make more. Ones with different genres. Most of these are very crime based.
__label__1 Add Me. This is a good text base game, and so are all the others by Uken. I have all of them and rate each one in my opinion 5 Stars. Uken, keep up the good work!
__label__1 Since I found your company I downloaded almost all of your games but there is a bug in every one of them plead fix it when the his goes off screen for the ones on kindle fire I don't know if it is For all devices but please fix it
__label__1 Sometimes, for fun, I like to search the App market for 'magic' and see what comes. This did, and I am downright pleased. As well, there are no apparent ads - WOW! The app does require permissions for network access, so I'm not sure whether that will cha
__label__1 I love this app,  It is the greatest app I ever tasted. chocolate chip and marshmallow or my favorite flavors. Ronald Reagan was the greatest magician of all time. when I return to the future (2083) I will definetly recommend this to all of my wooden fri
__label__1 I think it is very cute an colorful. My daughter enjoys playing the game very much. SHe likes all the dragons.
__label__1 Let's u add track album song info. Great for on the go people that needs to somehow organize media with no access to a computer.
__label__1 This is a great program.  It saved me from needing to copy my mp3s onto my computer and fix it there.  I was able to perform the fixes directly on my tablet.  I used it to fix the album artist info for a bunch of tracks that I copied from a CD that has v
__label__1 Okay, once caveat - it is easy to use for a novice if you know a little bit about what you are doing!  If you are saying &#34;what's an audio tag?&#34;, then this may not be the program for you, and perhaps a little reading on audio tagging is in order! 
__label__1 Let me update my songs information right in the app. There was no issue doing it and it saved a lot of time instead of going to my computer and fixing it from there.
__label__1 This helped me fix the unknown artist issue and it added album art easily....once I got used to navigating through the program. Very nice!
__label__1 Gojod app, covers any situation. I buy the full version to support the developer. Able to easily switch between type of calculator needed.
__label__1 Particularly like the unit converter. It is the simplest and easiest I have found for all basic unit conversions. Well worth a buck for all this app can do.
__label__1 "Calculator Ultimate" is an outstanding calculator app. The scientific functions are exactly what I was looking for and it has a great, easy to use layout. The addition of a unit converter (which gets a lot of use) makes this a real winner!Installed and 
__label__1 As I mentioned in my review of Calculator Ultimate Lite, I was impressed enough to purchase the full version. It's a very good calculator that runs fine on my Kindle Fire. It's not the most intuitive calculator that I've used, but a few minutes reading t
__label__0 This has got to be the most limited, unintuitive product I have ever purchased.  If you still have your old HP or Texas Instrument calculator - keep them and let this piece of junk go by the wayside.
__label__1 I just purchased this calculator- and initially in the length conversions, appeared to be very limited in range- so I emailed Duckseason at their support address- and received an answer the same morning- with instructions how to access the additional con
__label__1 Than just a calculator. Just like having a TI science calc.Convenient to have with your books. Would recommend to anyone
__label__1 The only problem that I had with the app was that the help was lacking.  It took a minute before I found out that to completely clear out previous calculations I had to HOLD the Ci button.  If the dev team reads this consider adding things like that in t
__label__1 Very nice app, works great and is very easy to use, the developers did a great job with this one. Thanks all, looking forward to more good works from all of you.
__label__1 Perfect for what I need. And has ability to do the more complicated stuff that middle/high school math students need today...but not all of those functions are available on the free version. I'm sticking with this because when/if I decide to let the kids
__label__1 This calculator app has some great features! I might buy the full version for the polynomial, trigonometry and unit conversion features.
__label__1 Everything you need for algebraic calculations.  Son used and was all he needed.  Even I could figure it out and its been about 30 years since I needed.
__label__0 I have tried several Scientific Calculator Appa for Droid and of all, I like this one the least. It is difficult to use, and the layout is confusing. Try another App before you buy this one.
__label__1 Worked just as described, very easy to use, nice clean design.  Looked great on samsung galaxy tablet.  1 2 3 4
__label__1 This calculator is feature rich. The scientific and conversion calculators are helpful. The only calculations I use that are missing are financial calculations. If the programmers added that it would be the only calculator I would ever need.
__label__1 This is the only free calculator I have found that properly handles -X squared.  Most of the free calculators will compute this as a positive number when it should be a negative number. You should read the help section or you will have a difficult. time 
__label__1 Nifty little program to do simple calculations. I do recommend this program for simple everyday use at home or in the store.
__label__1 When I first tried Calculator Ultimate Lite on my Kindle Fire, I wasn't overly impressed. It had enough functionality to be a nice free app, but it wasn't overly intuitive on how to use it. However, after I spent a few minutes reading the Help screens, i
__label__1 Nothing light about this! Easy to use and even has conversion charts! I will probably use that more than the calculator. Fantastic app!!
__label__0 its good because it has fractions but... it doesn't even have division a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a
__label__1 THIS GAME IS SOOO ADDICTIVE. BEWARE! I PLAYED THIS GAME ALL NIGHT. I WISH I COULDVE PLAYED IT ALL DATLY TODAY BUT I HAD SCHOOL. SEVEN CRUEL HOURS OF OUR LIVES. AMEN BROTHER. AND THE GOVERNMENT IS TRYING TO MAKE IT EIGHT. OMG!  THE ONLY WAY ANYONE WILL MA
__label__1 Most people are down rating because its to smart for them and there is buttons they don't know but this is a perfect calculator!  I recommend this to everyone! Sure there is some &quot;extra buttons&quot; but I use them and someday you WILL too!
__label__0 The lite version of this calculator is worthless. This has the least amount of features of any online trial version calculator. I would not buy the full version because the lite edition would not do anything that the included calculator would do. I would
__label__0 This installed on Android 2.1 and initially looked promising, but then embedded ads froze the app and it stopped working. This made it unusable and I uninstalled it. Also, the layout for scientific functions is on tabbed pages, making it difficult to use
__label__0 Not challenging and not fun.  The screens never change and it is so repeatative that it is boring beyond boring.
__label__1 this is not supposed to be a kid for teens this is for little kids and I'm tired of seeing reviews saying ti easy and boring. my five year old loves it.
__label__0 This game was fun until I couldn't get it to quit. it kept taking me wither to the screen to select level or it would start playing. After about 5 times selecting quit, and it not doing so I had to uninstall.
__label__1 I wanted to find something my grandson could play. I found it. It's fun and easy. I definitely would not recommend it for a phone, but it works great for my tablet.
__label__1 Whacky Mole is a favorate of the grandkids.  I do worry when they get real involved and forget they are using a delicate device.The game keeps them involved for long periods of time.Whacky Mole is great in helping develop hand and eye coordination, which
__label__1 I have always looked for this game in arcades, but now I have it on my Kindle Fire &amp; can play it for free anytime I like.  It's still fun to play as an adult &amp; is appropriate for the young ones as well.  I would reccommend it for anyone who has n
__label__1 this game is cute but its fer younger kids. but my little brother loves it! so id say it a 5 star!
__label__1 I love playing Whack a Mole at the carnival and figured I would try it on my Kindle Fire.  It is a lot of fun and thankfully easier than the ones in the carnival.  This is one of my favorite games to play.
__label__1 Okay, Whacky Moles is not a fantastic game that you'll play hundreds of times. But it is extremely easy to learn - as in about five seconds - and there is a bit of satisfaction in whacking the moles, squashing them, bashing them, whatever you want to cal
__label__1 Love this game, it is fun and sort of addicting. This is a fun game for kids and adults. I play it all the time.
__label__0 Yes this game is Horryble, correct spelling of the word is too good for this bad game. Forget about it.
__label__0 you have to complete all the levels in one session you can't open it then close it or you have to start at level one again it is kinda a boring app and this is on the kindle fire
__label__0 IF YOU EVER GET THIS GAME THEN U WILL BORE YOUR SELF TO Death don't get read my LIPS DO NOT EVER NOT GET IT
__label__1 This really brings back the classic Whack-A-Mole and it's nice that I don't have to pay at an arcade to play this. It is basically Whack-A-Mole but it is more complex because of the modes. First you choose between Classic and Endurance (A longer game) an
__label__1 My 5 year old just loves this game so much!! He plays all the time, its easy and fun for him. I find myslef playing against him to see who will win! Its lots of fun I would recommend to anyone that has young kids!
__label__1 Cute for the kids to play!  I would recommend this game for all ages. The children would love to play it for hours.
__label__0 I tinkle they should make it a bit harder. I'm 9. it been 20 min width this app and I finished it allLAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
__label__1 Works great and looks great on kindle fire. My 2 and 4 year old love to play this. Just like whack a mole. 3 varieties of play.
__label__1 I really enjoy playing this game. It is just like the whack-a-mole at Chucky Cheese and other places. Kids and adults will have fun with this.
__label__1 Everything runs fine on my white pandigital. This is a classic that has 3 modes btw. Try this app if your looking for a good touch screen  game
__label__1 the kid in me just loves this.  it's nice to have a fun game to blow off steam and not have to put a lot of thought into playing.  I love that my son can sit in my lap and we can play it together.
__label__0 It is unacceptable that a game can't be moved to the sd card. It is cute enough, but uninstalled for wasting space. And ads.
__label__0 This app was okay for the first few minutes then seemed boring....Maybe I'm just to old for it and this is better suited for younger
__label__1 its adorable!!!! u learn how to take care if a little animal!! have fun!!!! while u mix potions and go on missions u help save the earth:]
__label__1 This super adorable game is fun and perfect for all ages. When I first saw it in the app store I thought it would be babyish then I read the reviews on it and they were good so now I pay it every day. I LOVE IT. :)
__label__1 My grandchildren and I Love this game..... recommend it to all my family and friends.......Its wonderful to play and you don't have to be a brain surg.
__label__1 I luv this game. But I don't know how to access the monk thing  or  upgradeYour home and get rid of that dam goffer !!!  Other than that, the game is the vast!
__label__1 Cute fun addicting game. My kids can play it and grab me some stars. I love it! Cute little Furdi.
__label__0 boring, hard to maneuver, waste of a dollar and space on my device. Even my child refused to play it
__label__1 Zomg!!!!! I love this game!!!!! its sort of confuzling at some parts but I just look up cheats wen I get stuckeded so you should really get it!!!!! I mean it!!!!
__label__0 this stupid app uses a ton of phone memory instead of the sd card..whyyyyyyyyyy???  when will developers understand this simple stufff....duh!!!!
__label__1 ADD IT TO KINDLE FIRE I MISS PLAYING IT gr gr gr gr gr gr IM SO MAD.AT THIS GAME RIGHT NOW but i still love it  just please make it avalible for kindle fire
__label__1 I had this game on my old tablet and fell in love with it, i know there have been lots of updates and it is a  fun and good game, please bring it to kindle fire
__label__1 Hey my name's Leah j Gulota and I give this game 5 stars. Believe me the bad reviews are TOTALLY WRONG!!!!! The game is challenging that's what make it fun. I'm still searching to find the last totem you have to pay to the brothers. It works perfectly fi
__label__0 I usually do great with puzzles, but this is so abstract in idea that you wind up trying to figure out what the heck your suppose to do next.  Delete.
__label__1 This is one of those games in where a monster or alien is lost on Earth and you must take care of it in order for it to get back home, but better. This is truly adorable. This little guy is named Furdiburb and while his parents were visiting Earth, they 
__label__1 This game is fun and exciting. Be sure to check on your Furdiburb! It needs your love and care!I highly recommend this game for all ages!You never get bored! There are a lot of things to do!Don't listen to the bad reviews! This game is awesome!
__label__0 I downloaded this ap thinking it would be a great pasttime.  I was wrong. I dont think the reviewers mentioned the mumbo jumbo thats in this game. I quickly got rid of this game, things like &quot;pay homage to the totems &quot; and huge skull mountains 
__label__1 this game is well done. fun and makes you think! used to play this on android phone and now I'm so glad it's available for my kindle
__label__1 i love this game but most people dont understand that it is about helping furdi get back to hi  home  planet ther is a space ship that u discover an  if u help all the people they give u parts to the space ship once u build the entire spaceship u fly hom
__label__1 I love playing this game on my phone and am excited to play it on my Kindle. This is one game I'm actually going to ENJOY starting over! I know it can be transferred, but that's how  much I love it; I'd rather just play it from the beginning.
__label__0 There are like three pages of content and you can either go from one to the next or one to the previous. Over and over.  No games, just pages explaining that you can either go to the next or go back to the last. Seriously. Deleted it
__label__1 Does exactly what it says, though you can use similar generators on the web. This app gives you a choice of different code sizes. Nuff said.
__label__0 have no idea how to use it...no direction anywhere.  It is just an added icon.  would appreciate some direction, somehow...thank you
__label__0 Has all the makings of doing what it says but I've found that although it generates the QR code and can save it to my Kindle Fire HD 8.9 as a picture, it won't email it to my specified email address.  Not sure why but it appears the programmer dropped th

__label__1 You can actually save the QR codes you generate, all you have to do is hold down on your QR, and it will say "Save" and it will save to your Gallery.Anyway, it is very awesome!
__label__1 I downloaded it, ran it, made a qr code, it worked. A great tool! I had no problems emailing, saving or reading the code.
__label__1 This is a great application. I am not using it as a traveler but to teach words and phrases in French to my Spanish speaking grandkids, and at the same time they are practicing their English.
__label__1 This is a great tool for learning basic phrases and nouns in a new language or to use during travels to communicate with locals in a foreign country.  It uses native speakers to speak phrases and words so you can learn to speak them appropriately.  Very

__label__1 This app ia so much fun! Fingerpainting without the mess. Just for your information, I am 61 years old. This is a creative tool I will use a lot!
__label__1 This is a very basic and very good drawing app. Compared to others, Scribbler is probably the best one I have ever tried. The only thing I would want from an update is some more drawing styles.
__label__1 This app is a lot of fun. I love to draw and this app is great for that. You can draw anything you can think of.
__label__1 This was bought for my grandkids who love to scribble on my Kindle.  They alwayswrite me messages to read later when I'm looking at it.

__label__1 This is my go-to app for reading comics that I have in CBR or CBZ format.  There are so many sub-options to tweak the app to your liking.  I can only long for an app like this on my Macbook Pro.  I have purchased this app through the Amazon App Store for

__label__1 I can't express how happy I am to have found this app to read and re-read the graphic novels I had already bundled up on my laptop. It's a real joy! And it organizes all the books in shelf like GUI. That's a nice touch too.
__label__1 I wish I knew about this when I 1st bought my Kindle Fire HD 8.9&#34;.Since I bought this, I've been reading the comic books that I've wanted to check out for quite some time now.I've loaded over 100 of them and loving every min of it. This has helped me

__label__1 This app works really well, and is pretty simple to use! Just hook up the kindle to your computer, drop your comics in, sync them in the app and you're done. You can choose to view all your comics at once, view them by series, or create a custom reading

__label__1 amazing and awesome fun I really like this app once I get an amazon card this is the first thing I will buy
__label__1 I am used to using CReader on my PC to read comics, and was dismayed to see it wasn't available for android. I soon found that ComiCat is as good if not better. It has crisp visuals and an easy to use interface.
__label__1 I downloaded a few of the free apps to see how they were, and went on a few comic sites, and almost every single one of them recommended ComiCat. I wasn't too willing to spend $2.99 for an app, especially if I didn't have to, but after downloading and de

__label__1 In my opinion, this is the best app on the market for reading your comic book files that you already own. It's worth paying the $2.99 for. I had tried other free apps to view my comics but they weren't that great. This automatically maximized the pages t

__label__1 Perfect to read comics and PDFs on! And the CBR and cBZ files show up perfect as well! Thanks a bunch!
__label__1 It reads all my comics perfectly and I like how well the app arranges my books, per folder and issue number. The only draw back is not knowing how to remove the silly green icon after the book is read. I accidentally allowed them a couple times and I fin

__label__1 I have comic book files on my kindle fire and this app sorts them all in a nice order.  Just click on the app and your comic opens to the last book you read.  The only thing I wish would be fixed is when you exit a book then open it up again, it isn't ac
__label__1 I load up some comics, this reads them. Hasn't crashed or failed in over 400 files so far. Worth it for its stability alone. View modes are fine, but I STILL haven't figured out how to hold my Kindle without accidentally turning a page or fast-forwarding
__label__1 This is a great piece of software for the Kindle Fire!! Reads everything I've thrown at it and does it effortlessly. I was a little hesitant at first as I had not heard of this software before but I'm SO glad I spent the $1.49 at the time to buy it. I've

__label__1 I was looking around for a few day before I found this app. It's price is very cheap and this app is by far the best I've seen so far. Don't waste your money on anything else. ComiCat has everything that you're looking for. I have Gigs and Gigs of Digita
__label__1 I previously left a negative review to which the developers responded within an hour.  I was unable to respond in a timely fashion, and before I even was able to respond, they had released an update addressing my issue.  Great App, worth the low price.
__label__0 wasn't worth the time or energy to upload it, play it for a short while & decide to remove it.
__label__1 I love this game. I am addicted to it.  I like it because it seems easier to see the numbers.
__label__1 I am not all that successful with the paper and pencil style of Sudoku, but I was still interested in learning the game. The digital version has been great for me.
__label__1 I was an eager but uninitiated novice when I downloaded this great free app. Beginning with the Very Easy puzzles, I began to figure out the logic and learn the patterns. The app makes this easy with its "Analyze" (points you back to the sudoku encyclope

__label__1 This program offers every kind of sudoku at every level. The hints/helps offered are a little stingy,but I play at the difficult levels. A very thorough program.
__label__1 I love Sudoku and this one is one of the best I have played.  It has lots of features but is still really clear cut and easy to use.
__label__1 I really like how easy it is to fill in the numbers especially pencilling in the small numbers.  It makes even more difficult puzzles easier to work on.

__label__1 I like Sudoku. With 10,000 free games, this should last me a while! I like that the game is divided into very easy, easy, etc. That way I can choose which section to play depending on how sharp I feel!
__label__0 Hated this game, never got past the first puzzle and could not understand the markings.  I play Sodoku all the time and at supposedly higher levels and this game is not fun.

__label__1 I love this game anyway, but I especially love this online version. Recommended to several individuals, including my sister, who also loves it.
__label__1 And you don't have to be on the web to use it. If you play one a day it will last for more than 27 years - if your device lasts that long!!
__label__0 It is too difficult to figure out what buttons to push and in which order.  I tap a number and then tap the box and it is the wrong number.  Too complicated for me.
__label__1 My husband is addicted to this game. He especially likes the Nightmare Puzzles. I'll stick with the Easy to Moderate. Plenty of puzzles for passing away the time.
__label__1 Not using any more as I guess I am too mentally challenged to get it, just can't seem to figure it out.
__label__1 does this every night before bed helps me fall asleep faster and helps my mind to focus. great download for free
__label__1 I chose this version of Sudoku because of the number of games available - 10,000 should keep me going for a long time.  I quickly discovered that this version highlights the numbers as you're working with them, making it easier to spot where you need to 
__label__1 I love playing this game and it makes it so much easier on my Kindle Fire HD, I don' t have to search for my books or a pen!!!!
__label__1 Have been playing with this one for a while.  The game variations and difficulty, minimal device resources used, and great game saves make this an easy 5 star.  Having the choice not to be on the social sharing was the clincher.  Worth every star.  :-)
__label__1 In addition to having 10,000 puzzles in a wide range of difficulties, it allows you to enter a newspaper puzzle by hand to solve on your android device or save for later.  (Create an &quot;empty&quot; puzzle and put in the starting numbers and then press

__label__1 I absolutely love this game. I work the puzzles books at home all the time, but this game is fantastic. It has many different levels to choose from and that is what I like if you want a challenge.
__label__1 And this is my favorite sudoku app.  It is the easiest to mark your notes and automaticly corrects the notes when you place your pernament number in position and it highlights the number when you have placed all nine numbers in to the grid.
__label__0 I paid fir My Horoscope Pro but the app says I have to pay MORE for &quot;Pro&quot; ad-free.  I want my money back!!!!
__label__1 This is definitely the best horoscope app it's so great it tells my day almost perfectly and it gives the best advice
__label__1 I have found Horoscope Pro to be a great way to get my daily forecast and also share with others.
__label__1 I find this app to be fun, amusing, and entertaining. Its even spot on sometimes. I like looking up my friends' horoscopes to see what kind of a day they were supposed to have. Easy to use, no problems.
__label__1 I know real emotional feelings towards is out it's amazing as matter fact I would rate it a5 point 5 if it went over 5 stars its so accurate with my motional State day today it blows my mind still everytime I look at it I once had an epic astrology book 
__label__0 Well I was looking for an app to guive me an outlook for the day, this is not it. I do not understand it organization or it degins. I does not seem to work all that great for day to day...would ot recommend as it is. I wanted to like it.
__label__1 THIS APP IS ONE OF THE BEST HOROSCOPE APPS I HAVE USED, PROBABLY ACTUALLY THE BEST I HAVE USED. RIGHT ON WITH THE EMOTIONS AND MORE. THANKS.
__label__1 This app is very insightful. It is accurate and helps me know what to expect from my day and my emotions. I definitely recommend this app it's worth your money.
__label__1 I like this application. I got it because it seemed simple and easy to use. It has one thought per day which usually appear to be uplifting or motivational.  Because I don't always remember to check daily I really enjoy the feature that allows me to revi
__label__1 I like that I'm able to see what kind of day I am going to have. I think that it can happen or not I tried not to take to heart.
__label__1 This is one of the best daily horoscope apps. I highly recommend it.Easy to use, and lots of fun.
__label__1 I like being able to push a button and read what the stars have aligned for me. I say ME but there are many people with the same sign, so each and everyone of us has to figure out what to do with the information we are given.
__label__1 GREAT APP FOR HOROSCOPE READERS. A LOT OF THEM HAPPEN TO BE TRUE. KEEP UP THE GREAT WORK. THANK YOU.
__label__1 Got this app because I'm someone who likes to read my horoscope daily(which really means whatever day I remember to check the app). But, this app is great for that since it lets you see the four most recent days. The graphics are very pretty and it's eas
__label__1 the app is easy to use and the interface very cute. I really like seeing what my horoscope says for the day. The only thing I might suggest is a little daily notification  saying new horoscope for the day available because I tend to forget to check it.
__label__1 I enjoy this app for entertainment purposes. Lot of fun but sometimes right on the mark. I don't read it until later in the day, to see how close it gets. Lot of surprises that way since I don't use app to govern my life.
__label__1 My horoscope pro has hit who I am and what I need to do for the day very much worth the dollar
__label__1 I really like this app because so few sites divide each sign into the correct stage of the sun. Not everyone realizes that particular &quot;subsign&quot;. For example I am a late Pisces &amp; I am quite different from an early Pisces.
__label__1 ,This is excellent if you want to know the weather in your area, .especially when bad weather approaches. I really like it!!
__label__1 I like the fact each horoscope sign is divided into 4 decanates providing a little less generaization than most horoscopes.  At this point, I sm still validating accuracy.

__label__1 I like it its just that it uses the same fourtans every couple other times. I gave it a 5 star reveiw I like it and I hope you do to!
__label__1 Just your basic horoscope app, but runs great. My favorite part is how in depth they get with date of birth. No complaints but I wish it did extended horoscopes.
__label__1 This is a great little app for checking daily horoscope.  I have some about my zodiac sign.  Turns out I was destined to be the person I am today. LOL!
__label__1 I think this is a very good app! but it doesn't do very much. I think it needs to add more options!!!!!!!!
__label__1 This horoscope app will be my all time favorite! This reveals what happens everyday and how not only your zodiac sign should react, but it breaks down the three decanates in a precise organized form. Decan's provided the readings of the RULER, SUB-RULER,

__label__1 I like this app and how it breaks down the zodiac signs into I, II, &amp; III. This makes for a more personalized horoscope. You can set it to show yours when it opens &amp; check any other signs forecast by scrolling thru the signs. I like free apps and

__label__1 this app has given like the perfect horoscopes for both me and my finance we have been completely amazed by how on point it has been!

__label__1 I down loaded this app for free, & thought I would give it try. I admit that I purchased awhile ago & have just started using it in the past 2 weeks. All you do is put your B-day in & the app locates your correct horoscope. You can also check anyone's ju
__label__1 works well and have had no issues. I could suggest that the cancer symbol be changed to a crab rather than a lobster.

__label__0 Unfortunately I can only blame myself for this horrendous purchase.  It's nothing but a sun sign daily.  I should know better, I've been an astrologist for over 40 years.  I am ashamed of myself.
__label__1 it has three settings for each sign, you have to find the right one for you. I think this app is spot on!
__label__0 This game stinks.  Do not even get it. It is so stupid. Do not waste your time even getting this app. DONT GET IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

__label__1 Easy...usually very dead on! I look for my  rising and moon sign as well...and it's strange how as a cancerian..how much I am like my moon sign..during phases of the moon. I'm sure there are far more detailed in depth apps...but for free. I'm surprised a

__label__1 I am a sucker for these kind of ape and this is my favorite so far. Easy to use, seems pretty accurate. Love it!
__label__1 your horoscope is more detailed and accurately split. Libra has different decants (I think that's the word) and no 'scope is just a generic blurb for each sign. It's different for, say, a Libra born on the 4th and a Libra born on the 15th.
__label__1 fun app! i enjoy reading my daily horoscope. no complaints. ads are small and out of the way. quick to load. easy to read.
__label__1 Just like you read your horoscope daily in the newspaper,here is another wayY too,just pick your sign and read what it says

__label__1 I really like the Horoscope cause I like to see my sign everyday and my husband's too. It helps me to see what kind of day we both are going to encounter and what may happen that day or evening. Thank You. Please go and purchase this from your Amazon sto
__label__0 Nov 17.  how dumb is that! how can you not finish all birthdays! good app but missing bdays ugh! I wanted to have fun
__label__1 This is a very good Horoscope app. Especially for being a free one. I highly recommend it. I like the feature of being able to select the exact section of your personal decante. Nice feature! And very easy to go from different signs if you want to.
__label__1 When i first got this app it was more for fun, but now that I've had it for a while its crazy that its spot on with how im feeling and how to resolve it. So far I give it a five star rating. We'll see if this changes in the future

__label__1 It mostly does as described. Loads very qui&ccedil;kly,  seems to be accurate,  even looking back to the previous days. I have tried many of the free apps and have found this one to be the most affective.
__label__1 The perfect horoscope app. It not too big. It's fast and usually very accurate. It's way more detailed than most are. It separates you into a category and bases your reading on the week of your birth date I believe. And it shows the prior and the next da

__label__1 Good app. Fun to read every once in a while. Pretty neat, I would recommend this app to anyone looking for amusement.
__label__0 At least the horoscopes in some newspapers have some humor for those of us who, like Sheldon, find such things hokum. I thought this would have something to start off my day with a smile. Not this: Today "slowly but surely, life on my small, tranquil isl
__label__1 Enjoy reading my horoscope at the end of my evening to see how it related to my day.  Lots of fun.

__label__1 it is pretty agitate,to be honest.most of the things are spot on perfect.I always check it before I wake up!

__label__1 If you like to read your horoscope daily and enjoy looking at your friends' signs as well then you will like this app.  I have enjoyed what the horoscopes say and like that I can look two days ahead or behind.
__label__1 I love this app! Not only does it have very specific zodiac signs (e.g. 1st, 2nd, or 3rd Gemini), but it also has horoscopes for up to two days in the past and two days into the future. I've found it very concise with what's going on in my life. There ar
__label__1 The app DOES have January 6th for Capricorn. -_-' you have to click on the number next to it, there are three different fortunes for each one. it breaks it up onto sections so don't be so blind, just play around with the app for a bit and figure it out a
__label__1 this a great fun little app I use it and its very surprisingly true or maybe I twist what happens in reality to make it seem like that whtevr great app
__label__1 This an app that tells you what your day is like. It is predicted by Gods. By figuring out what horoscope you are depends on what id your birthday. This app is very interesting.
__label__1 I do not believe in horoscopes...I do read mine each day anyway.  I wish some of them would come true.
__label__1 I am not someone who really believes horoscopes However; after checking my horse poop with this app within the last 2 weeks, I must say that it's pretty accurate.The app is easy to navigate.
__label__1 This astrology app seems to have a real depth to it. Much more accurate and involved than those from newspaper's, magazines,etc. I definetly recommend it for those interested in this topic.

__label__1 great little app that does exactly what it is supposed to do. lots of choices for individual signs. and free to boot!
__label__1 I tried another free horoscope app for the fire, and much prefer this one. better design. faster, and advice - by decanate - seems appropriate. nice addition to the Fire. Great app
__label__1 I have a kindle fire hd 7inch and this app works really good on here I check my horoscope allot so I've tried almost every horoscope app and this one seems the most real to my life.
__label__1 I love. it I like reading it every day . IF IT SAYS I AM going to have a bad day I try to turn it around an make it a good one.I love it.
__label__1 For the Ppl that think their bday is not on here you have to use it right.  It is broken down into 3 cycles for each sign so u have to pick the right one.  It took me a lil bit to figure that out.  It also can give u a day or 2 ahead.)
__label__1 Works for me just fine!  I find it entertaining and often read last weeks horoscope just to see how close to reality it was.
__label__1 I like it. I read it of a morning and think about it at night and.... I think that it is oddly close to that day. It's a nice app. Pretty cool.
__label__1 I like this app because I like to Keep up on my.horoscope. if you.like horoscopes, this is the app for you.
__label__1 Awesome app. This helped me stay calm and relax. the best part? IT'S FREE! Anyways, I would really recommend this app to everyone.

__label__1 I bought it not to long ago. Couple days. It was pretty awesome. It knows exactly what's going on with me on some days. Lifts my spirits. You cam also check out other horoscopes not just your own. I looked my siblings and they enjoyed it too. It's the be
__label__1 its nice to get a glimpse at what ones future holds. I like this app because it comes pretty close to what usually comes about.
__label__0 Stay away from this app unless you want to be in a bad mood everyday!  Everyday is negative or says have a great day because tomorrow is going to be crap!
__label__1 I think that this is a great app very helpful in your everyday life. And good to share with friends.
__label__1 It is easy to read and has good graphics and is easy to use. The horoscope is mostly accurate too. I love it.
__label__1 I enjoyed this very much.  It gives you insight into what your day might be and you can avoid traps of the mind games  people play and avoid them.
__label__1 This is a GREAT app. The horoscopes I read were amazingly appropriate for my friend and myself. I would recommend this app to all of my friends.
__label__1 to the person who says there is no capricorn.wtf there is Capricorn! I would rate 5 stars. it has my constalation Leo.
__label__1 I read my Horoscope for fun.  This app. has been so dead on as to what is going on in my life.  So close sometimes that it gives me the Willies. Try it, its free! .
__label__1 Weird it seems to know what's happening. Coincide or not? Check it out and see. Or maybe I'm just nuts lol ;)
__label__1 I like this app a lot...it does what it says and in no time I have my horoscope up on my screen...I love and I use it all the time
__label__1 I love this app! very accurate and reliable! would recommend to any one that likes reading their horoscopes regularly! Try it!
__label__1 I have this app. on my Kindle Fire 1st gen. and it works perfectly. The horoscopes are well written, informative and rather accurate. Some horoscope app.s are cheesy, but not this one. I highly recommend!
__label__1 This is a great app that is both attractive and efficient. It provides a well-rounded and thorough horoscope based on a three decanate system. Highly recommended.
__label__1 This is a great app. that makes you think about things before you do them.  At least that is what I get out of it.  For that reason I give it a five.  This is a buy...
__label__1 Now there is no guess work, since I got this app.  I know where I stand as the day begins!
__label__1 I like being able to check my horoscope with more details than what I am used to because I never believed I fit into my sign.
__label__1 sometimes these things are somewhat correct but this app seems to be right on the money.  I also like to not read it for the week then go back just to see if those things really happened. pretty cool stuff
__label__1 I recently just started reading my horoscope with this thing and stuff yeah what yeah I really hats that you have to have a long review
__label__1 I love seeing what my scope is and all the people around me. It's easy to use and fun to use. Though I don't really believe what it says, sometimes it is right on the money. Then I am shocked!
__label__1 the layout is very sexy and attractive it is very easy to navigate and the horoscopes are plausible and legitimate. these will make your day in the morning.
__label__0 my sign is Liberia but it doesn't even have my birthday on there. it's a piece of junk. whatever you do don't by this app.
__label__1 Great app I enjoy the interface and lay out.  Visually appealing. Easy to use and have had no problems with it.
__label__1 I like this horoscope app a lot. it seems be be pretty accurate most of the time too. I check everyday almost
__label__1 this is the one thing that you thought you wouldn't need, but you do need it. I find it crazy accurate to what ever happens in my day, which is why i love it so much! you should give it a shot. who knows, it might impress you as much as it impresses me!!
__label__1 I like that you can look back, or forward, to see how your day has been or what to expect. And it is beautiful, too.
__label__1 This an awesome app for horoscopes. the daily horoscopes are enjoyable to read. most of the time they are right on point
__label__1 This app is enjoyable to me. I check it out first thing in the morning and reread it again at night to see if it applied to my day. So far it's been right on point.
__label__1 fun and the app tells the truth haha sorry for the people who don't like the app or it didn't work out for you......
__label__1 This a great application to jump start your mornings, just like your first cup of coffee. It is very informative and a lot of fun! It's better than your newspaper!!
__label__1 I like this app. it lets you look at the horoscopes for other signs besides your own so you see who gets a better fortune. Aquarius or Aries Taurus or virgo piecies or capricorn
__label__1 I say it is super fun to read. I love what it tell you the stuff happens most the time!!!!!
__label__1 it tells me things I know about my self and I love it very much it shows me why I am how I am.
__label__1 This app is fun for everyone who likes horoscopes. This particular app has 3 dimensions for you daily. I've tried lots of the other horoscope apps this one I highly recommend. Some days good some not so.
__label__1 I really love this app. Every day horoscope is written very nicely and without crazy philosophical nonsense. It's direct and detailed.
__label__0 my birthday and my boyfriend's are not on there theres gaps everywhere at first I thought this was made by a kid poor child Ps.I am only 11 maybe the full ape is better.
__label__1 Good app.  Not childish. Maybe a little more generalized than I would like, but it meets expectations.  Check this out.
__label__1 its pretty accurate and I love the backgroud its good stuff it guessed how my day was gonna go and it was right!
__label__1 I like the zodiac readings I try yo remember to look at it every day and sometimes it's right on target.
__label__1 this app is really good i use it every day n its always updated. I recammend this app to anyone interested in their horoscope
__label__1 I am not one who loves every app. This is almost scary accurate. Hope it stays that way! Well, maybe not tomorrows.....!
__label__1 pretty accurate and interesting my mom and I compare horoscopes every morning normally its pretty dead on. I would like more options tho. like specify love interests or careers
__label__0 Unfortunately this would not open in my android. I wish it would have; it could  have been an entertaining app.
__label__1 January 6 is in the second part of Capricorn ......read instructions before u rate something bad for your own short coming. Very useful and entertaining tool Thanks
__label__1 Interesting app.  I like how the dates are sorted in the sign, which is better than a regular horroscope.  I hate the 20 word minimum review requirement.
__label__1 Absolutely wonderful. Great service and highly sophisticated. Completely workable, down-packed to the fullest. I think it is easy to use and is spot on.
__label__1 I've never had such a detailed an accurate horoscope. I love this app! It's right all the time and nothing like other ones out there!
__label__1 I love this app for kindle fire. now I can read my horoscope when ever were ever.I highly suggest it for other people. oh and also it helps on somedays but to me they help every day with this addvice that it gives I am more successful in life.
__label__1 I could not be more impressed. this app is well made, never breaks, and is always there with the right information. nice work!!!
__label__1 I really enjoy My Horoscope, especially since I have updated this app. I like how with this app you can read the past couple days, (I like to see how accurate it was), as well as reading into the next couple of days. As I stated, I really do enjoy this a
__label__1 Shows multiple horoscopes; Depending on which week of the month you were born. I don't take these serious, but the first 2 were strangely accurate.
__label__0 I tried playing this for about 10 minutes, and then just said screw it i'm bored.  I might just not be a hardcore enough RPG'er
__label__1 My rating is based off of the time I've spent playing this game.  Fun and addicting if you love sci0fi stuff you will enjoy this text based game.  Be warned you will get sick of this game after a while.
__label__1 This game is loads of fun.  You can play differently depending on your style, military, spy, trader, etc. Expect to lose some sleep.
__label__1 Probably the best android game i have played. The dev's constantly update the game. Download the free game before paying the price for the paid game and make sure it's for you.
__label__0 Unable to use on old Droid X2 and forced closing a constant issue. It was suggested to go with the paid version and it performed as well as the free version. NOT AT ALL. Perhaps more hardware related, but they need to work hand in hand,
__label__0 nothing to it has many problems you dont see anything and is hard to follow pretty much sums it up
__label__1 I really enjoy this game. the detail into some of the thought is great. graphics are good. some things could be better like knowing which planets are what and under what faction but overall a great game. lots of options and plenty of stuff to do.  thanks
__label__1 i have the full premuim version of star traders. this game is absolutely fantastic if getting rich amid galactic empires is your thing. note this game has. very steep learning curve and is not easy, with harder modes even having permanent death.
__label__1 I play the premium version. It works great on Kindle Fire HD and I have never had any problems. Game is fully functional when there is no wifi access. The developers frequently update with more content.
__label__1 This takes me back to the days of text based rpgs. Way too much fun. I can waste hours at a time playing.
__label__1 I love this app and planning on getting elite this is a epic app I recconmond it to all people
__label__1 This game is awesome. I cannot say enough good things about it. If you liked Trade Wars 2002, Outpost Trader or Planets: The Exploration of Space back in the BBS days, you will feel right at home with Star Traders RPG.
__label__1 Brings me back to my teens, playing TradeWars on the local WWIV BBSes.  It isn't much of a casual game, but I don't mind at all.  Most of the apps I find are short attention-span style games.  This one is one of those that you really get to spend some ti
__label__1 This game is better than I thought it would be, I've spent hours playing it. I'm going to get the elite version so I can get more upgrades and ships and go to more planets. This game plays smooth and fast on my Kindle Fire. I absolutely love this game.
__label__1 Brings back fond memories of &quot;Privateer&quot;.  Not an easy game. A real game that rewards deep and continuous play.  The Trese brothers know how to do it right.  All their games are great and the elite versions are worth more than their price.  Exc
__label__1 Kind of reminds of that old game that's not available for (DOS) PC's anymore. Mine, sell, trade, improve. Great sim!
__label__0 I sign up with very specific info pertinent to each game. Either this game is malicious or they are selling users information to other people.Downloader beware, your info may be a risk with this app.
__label__0 Got a blank white screen/field where the pictures should have been.Some deck of HTML color reference cards!Wishing that this were compatible with all devices with Android, but it is not.
__label__1 this app does exactly what it says it does, gives you a quick reference card for hex codes of html colors. there's nothing on here to go wrong. its just a page with color boxes an hex codes. I'm very pleased with it
__label__1 It's listed as a quick reference card, and that's just what it is - quick reference. Displays swatches of color with the hex codes underneath them, with a zoom feature should you need it. I can usually figure out RGBs, it's the hex codes I have trouble w
__label__1 I teach photography and design and this is a simple and precise color guide. It is well done and attractive.
__label__0 I downloaded this app but i have not got the chance to use it yet. When i do i will right one.
__label__1 this is the best app EVER! I was able to do my taxes in 10 minutes. Super convenient. Will DEFINITELY use this app again next year!!!
__label__1 easy to use, fast did not take any time at all to get my taxes done and got results quick
__label__0 THOUGHT this might really help at tax time, but after reading the other reviews about going half way through inputting your info and then being instructed to pay for more help I deleted it.  Can't even tell you how much I hate those time wasters and
__label__1 Almost too good to be true! Only complaint was that my rebate was larger!! :) Would recommend &amp; will probably use in future.
__label__1 i don't like. having to pay to file taxes, but this tool does what is says and is easy to use.
__label__0 I input a lot of info then it wouldnt work, this is who i have been using in the past
__label__0 I am very disappointed they are misleading and know the psychology behind claiments and use it as an advertising bonanaza. Ripoffs
__label__1 This app made doing my taxes so easy this year. I had used another tax program for years, and been very happy with it. When I went through that program this year the bottom line was I owed IRS over $450. I downloaded TurbTax here for free on March 31st. 
__label__1 Wow, at first I was skeptic about this so called SnapTax take a photo of my tax return and poof it appears on the screen. Oh but was I wrong it took 2 seconds and it had all my info and was ready to file. Unbelievably user friendly interface for the novi
__label__0 You have to go online and pay $79 to finish your taxes. This is a complete lie and is dishonest at best.
__label__1 Did my taxes on this and efiled.  Loved it!  Easy to use and reliable.  I am very happy with Snaptax and with Turbotax.
__label__1 I was surprised by how easy it was. It only took 20 minutes and most of that was looking up information I forgot to print out first.
__label__0 Despite the other bad review, I couldn't bring myself to believe that Intuit would  actually put a product on the Kindle app store that wouldn't work with my Fire HD. But when I installed it, I found that sure enough, the HEADLINE FEATURE of the app, whi
__label__0 Did not recognize the camera... wanted me to enter all of the forms manually... so why would I need this?
__label__1 used tt in the past so some info was in it. breezed through. price was fair IMO. will use again.
__label__1 My friend used this App on my Kindle to prepare their taxes.  I haven't used it myself but it must have been a good addition because she got close to 2,000.00 return.  This was using the free version.
__label__1 great app! the only issue i had is one of my W-4 forms was more in the landscape mode and i couldn;t just snap a pic, but it walks you through everything for easy manual entry. easy and fast!
__label__1 I had no problems. Pretty straightforward and easy to use. I filed today before 9:50 pm PST. Awesome deal for 14.99.
__label__0 beautifully executed bait and switch. after you enter a ton of info it claims your return is too complicated for the android app and offers to transfer said info to the paid app. of course you go for it because you don't want to start all over. what is s
__label__0 I cannot say how baf it is when a game does not have an actual quit, but only allows you to  press the home button to end it. Bad. Bad. Bad. Who knows what it does when you leave that way.  Also, this game is slow between &rdquo; shots&rdquo;.
__label__1 I can't believe this game doesn't have more 5 star reviews. its a lot of fun, I like it and my kids do too. Definitely worth playing.
__label__0 I downloaded it, tried it and deleted it. I'd prefer a mini-golf or actual golf game. This is just silly.
__label__1 lol, more fun than I thought this would be.  I'll be trying to get a real life game of this going around the office on Monday. Well done devs.
__label__1 This is both hilarious and fun! I can see it may get old quickly, but I am enjoying it now.
__label__0 where is the exit button?  the app doesn't exit. need to force stop. otherwise its an ok game for free.
__label__1 I adore this game. My son and I laugh out loud trying different angles to improve our scores. Don't  miss this one.
__label__1 Kindle Fire review - Read the reviews and listen to the ones who have actually played the game.  Good graphics, great concept.  Controls work fine.  Certainly not an easy game, but then where would be the fun in that?  Normally I would give this four sta
__label__0 Does not work with Motorola photon, reinstalled several times but still got stuck in loading screen. Really wish amazon or the writers would screen these apps for each device.
__label__0 controls are really touchy, hard to master, game shoots the people without me even releasing and also freezes on every hole
__label__0 Loads to a black screen, vibrates once, vibrates once more, then the app quits. I tried twice but the results are the same on Samsung Intercept.
__label__1 this game is really fun!  it's definitely worth trying. and I love the guy when you get him to the target, really funny
__label__0 I got this app and it didn't even load I got it for my daughter and she liked it but she couldn't figure it out
__label__0 no exit button on menu, and back button doesn't exit... have to hit home and go to task manager to actually quit... poor programming IMO
__label__1 The style and feel of the game creates a fun/playful atmosphere that is very appealing. The animations of the characters, design of the cubicle and general gameplay just.marks it as a wonderful game.I definitely reccomend it!!
__label__0 works real great on paper, or real life...but not in a game. sorry.maybe there was better physics? trashcan will never stop this momentum.
__label__1 If you have a Kindle Fire, then it is pretty fun and addicting to me, but if you have an ipod, or iphone this game can be pretty hard to play on a small device.
__label__0 sux.however, cubicle golf in the real world is amazing!!!  great idea!!!  thanks!the app is very repetitive and boring.
__label__1 Not really golf. It is some slacker employee scooting around the office trying to avoid the boss (the obstacle) and get into a certain area as the hole. It is interesting and the comments that the employee and the boss say are pretty silly. I would actua
__label__0 You might want to review the section of Android Development Fundamentals 101 about closing the app. Back button and Menu do nothing, and there's no entry to quit. Without a task killer there would be no way to close this mess of a game. Uninstalled.
__label__0 Doesn't launch in ICS. Only gets a garbled display and background noise. Needs to be fixed so that people with new devices can use it.
__label__1 Works great on kindle fire.  As a cubicle dweller, i find this app hilarious.  Nice Lumberburg lines with the boss.
__label__0 Just another boring golf game. Nothing stabs out and nothing special enough to warrant purchasing. Piss on this one and don't pay it any mind
__label__1 This game is seriously fun. It's a challenging and interesting take on golf. Sure the boss is annoying but that's what obstacles are supposed to be.  I could do without the commentator's bad accent though! Gotta turn him off.
__label__0 Downloaded it thinking it would be a fun game to play.  Unfortunately it wouldn't even get past the splash screen.  I do appreciate that the only permission required is to prevent the phone from sleeping.  Might try it again in the future, and if so, I w
__label__1 I'm not sure what I was expecting... but this game is fun, smooth graphically, and original!  I don't understand the negative reviews at all.  This is worth the price and as the FAOTD it's just great!
__label__0 Not bad on my Evo but on my Asus just get a black screen.  I can hear sound but see nothing.  Went back to game description but it has no warnings against tablet use.Was hoping to see this on the larger screen, oh well.
__label__1 I had so much fun with this little game. I'm horrible at it, which is comical in and of itself, but I really enjoyed it. I like the 'clubs' being the people, and different people who represent each 'club', which was kind of hilarious. My son and I were l
__label__0 This app did not function on my COBY 7012 Tablet.The first hole played and when that hole was completed the app closed itself.No other holes than the first one were ever allowed.
__label__0 Seriously, I have to agree with others. This is awful. Won't even get past splash screen, can hear music. Force kill. Trying to run on Atrix. It would get at least another star if it got so far as a menu!
__label__0 I hate this app I mean what is the consept??????? for 99&cent; really. I do not recommend this appfrom marah shulda
__label__0 Junk. Yet another game that fails to allow a cancel/ quit option. Must activate Settings to find the app to allow you to Force Stop. Lame at best. Uninstall.
__label__1 super fun game glad it.was free I wouldn't pay 99.cents for a game it was awesome I.can't stop playing it iwould get it. this app works wonderful on the kindle fire or a tablet love this app
__label__1 penguins are an alpha species and they are beast and they rule. they live in the snow so they will be happy and they are on the top of the food chain and they destroy people
__label__0 every time I try to play this game, my phone freezes and I either keep hitting home until it F/C or I restart my phone. T-Mobile Galaxy S2 with dualcore with an o/c @ 1.78ghz. I don't know if its a conflict or just a bad app, but nothing should bog down/
__label__1 its not golf balls its coworkers in chairs with wheels! Hilarious fun. The announcer is witty and sounds cute.Download this FAOTD you will be glad you did.
__label__0 need to improve gain play. Slow to respond to User, particularly between strokes. could be more sensitive to intermediary hits.
__label__1 What a fun game.  Don't download or play if the product description doesn't strike your interest or per previous reviews does not work with your device.  For the rest of us this is a fun game.
__label__1 This app is no doubt 5 star worthy.  I got it as the app of the day, but it would be worth the money if it wasn't the app of the day.  It runs fantastic on my kindle fire.  The graphics are unbelievable.  The game itself was a great idea, and it was well
__label__0 Is there a zero start option anywhere? It does not FC, it simply does not open. Uninstalled.Droid 3 running CM9 ICS
__label__1 I thought this was a very clever idea, and definitely got a few laughs out of it. It could be a great game with a few changes. I agree the boss makes it too hard, and the option of playing without him, slowing him down, or maybe just having him give you 
__label__0 this game is horrible. I have never seen a game that did not have. A) difficulty control, B) instructions and C) THERE IS A FREAKING CEO WALKING UP AND DOWN GOING &quot;oo, looks like you're staying in late!&quot; it is a waste of space, don't. get. it.
__label__1 seriously come on. its a fun game and not meant to be strict golf. jeez the audacity of you people.
__label__1 I don't know why there are negative reviews!  Silly great app - especially free - fun comments by announcer.  Great to try out!
__label__1 Inspired by the game play, I thought I would give this a try at the office today. Perhaps I should have asked, however, before starting an impromptu game and then accidentally sending Susan into the eighth floor stairwell.
__label__0 Crashes on startup with a black screen on Toshiba Thrive (HC 3.2.1, Tegra 2). Eventually music will start playing but the game never displays. Tried it on my Droid (GB 2.3.7, A7@1.2ghz) as well and same thing happened. Bummer, sd the game idea looks inte
__label__0 ...which the developer tried to get me to do. Fun, but couldn't get out of the app. I had to shut off my tablet to get out of it. I had to let it go.
__label__1 free app free app first commentfree free free free free free free free free free free free free apppppppppppp of the day
__label__1 I laughed the whole time I was playing it.  We used to actually do stunts like this in the days before computers and cell phones. I absolutely love it.  I would gladly purchase for a version of this with more courses.
__label__1 I got this app for free, so I have to say I would have been satisfied regardless of how well it worked. With that said it worked great and was actually really fun. Would suggest to others
__label__0 the app is unable to run on my Atrix. all i get is a black screen with the notification bar. phone becomes unresponsive. it's a shame because the game looks pretty fun.
__label__0 it doesnt want to install i press the the button and now it doesnt want to do anything i quess i cant really try this out
__label__1 This is a great game, well worth the money. Can't stop playing. Very addicting. One of the best games on the markret.
__label__1 On a t mobile my touch 3g slide, this app runs super smoothly. The gameplay is fun and very addicting.
__label__1 Got this when it was free but I probably would've paid for it after playing it. It is a ton of fun and runs smooth even on the original motorola droid running stock android. Thanks for the free app amazon.
__label__1 This is a game that is well-worth paying for.  I played it for hours and hours.  The openGL graphics drain the batteries a bit, but it is worth it for the gorgeous glowing explosions!  I love the soundtrack--wish it was longer, but it is really good pump
__label__0 love this game but no way I'm re buying it. this is version 1.3 and Google play is version 2.21 and this doesn't work so well on more modern devices
__label__1 I gave this game a chance and found to be very addicting and fun.  I hope the developers make this game for the iPad soon, as the controls would work that much better on a larger screen.
__label__0 This is by far the stupidest thing I've ever seen. I'm 50+ but still.. give me a break. If this is what the younger gen is wasting time on.. enough said.
__label__0 I would love to try it.  It downloads but will not open on my G2x.  Hoping for an update soon!
__label__1 I love this game!  It is rather challenging, as it makes you formulate a plan and use strategy.  I keep playing the same level over and over again trying to best my score.  Without a doubt, this is the most used game on my phone.  Works great on my Droid
__label__1 I've played a wide range of defense games for Android from Robot Defense to Castle Defense as well as the cowboy and zombie ones, but when it comes to challenge this one is the best. I cant tell you how many times I've failed on a level on this game (it 
__label__1 Simple yet challenging, highly addictive!  Now I just wish they would add more levels.  Definitely the best tower defense game out there.
__label__1 I got this when it was the app of the day and quickly got hooked. each round is fast so it's ideal for brief downtimes.
__label__0 Won't install on mi Droid x an I am disappointed very much..??  Please fix it,  because I want to try it out really bad.  Thankyyou,.......  Droid x
__label__1 very fun and addictive! would like to see more explanation of how bonus is calculated. this is ideal for touchscreen app, Droid incredible.
__label__1 Great little game to play while in line since each round lasts 1-5 min. but screen needs to be bright so not good for outside play
__label__1 graphics are simple but good. gameplay is easy to learn but difficult to master which is the mark of a good game. works great on droidx.
__label__1 Strategy doesn't really come into play til later levels, but animations are pretty and game is a lot of fun. If you like tower defense games, get this. EVO.
__label__1 I love this game!  It's super fun, has good sound effects, decent sound track, and excellent old school graphics. One of the most addictive games for Android.
__label__1 Come on, developers, this is how you do it!  The game works wonderfully on the Xoom.  The larger screen probably makes it easier to play than on a tiny phone.It's pretty much your standard castle defense game, build guns to stop invading forces, make mon
__label__1 I haven't been able to put it down yet this morning. New take on defense games that I have yet to play a similar one.
__label__1 Has a high difficulty level but I cannot put it down.  if you like tower defense games this is the best on android.
__label__1 I love it!  It's very addictive.  The sound track is very cool.  I had no problems with the installation and it plays perfectly on my Droid X stock 2.2.1 non-rooted phone.  Highly recommended!  I also think the game is very well balanced.  While the lase
__label__1 I've been playing this game at least once a day since I got it a few weeks ago. It's easy enough to make me *want* to play it, and challenging enough that I haven't beaten all the levels yet.
__label__1 droid x running gingerbread.  I can't wait to start playing this game, it looks great!  I don't think an application should get 1 star just because it wouldn't install for someone.  how can you give 1 star to something you haven't even tried yet?  if you
__label__1 Unbelievably addicting.  This game has just the right amount of challenge combined with fun.  Very fun to try different combinations to see what works.
__label__1 great game, easy to learn but requires strategy to win. fun too. more levels please could use more starter levels
__label__1 Ive had this game for a while and I love it. I use it to kill time when Ive either gotta wait around or when Im smoking. It has a good amount of playability as long as you use atleast a portion of the right side of your brain. Its simple enough for you t
__label__0 ... this game will not install on my Flytouch 3 Android 2.2 tablet. That is really too bad because the reviews make it sound fun. Unfortunately the only message my tablet gives is &quot;Did not install.&quot; No error message that would help the dev.
__label__1 the graphic is amazing.  no ads.  will pay to get it, but free makes it even sweeter. get it today.
__label__1 Fantastic and challenging! Tried the free version and loved it. Got the Full version for free. Great deal, would pay for this app gladly.
__label__1 Great graphics. Game really gets you involved in the strategy. Each failure motivates you to try something else. It's very hard to stop playing.
__label__1 when k close my eyes, I see hex shapes and cool explosions! This game is addictive and fun. Perhaps a little too easy once you get the hang of it. The description says it doesn't work on the HTC Hero, bit it works great on my rooted CM7.0.2 Hero.
__label__1 excellent graphics, excellent music, excellent animation.  Very good tower defense.  if you have isaues with the app, email the developer directly - he/she can't respond to comments here.  Evo4g
__label__1 only real issue I am having is on hard when i beat the level , it only shows that i beat it (green check mark) 1 in 10 times maybe you have to get the high score on hard for it to count, not sure?
__label__1 I do not play many games, so if I become addicted to one, you know it must be fun. I played for hours.
__label__1 Very fun game, we need more levels!! Wish my work breaks lasted longer now, lol. Looking forward to upgrade and new levels soon.
__label__1 Thought this game would be another one of those tower games, but Hex Defense is actually fun and engaging! Simple to learn but tough to master!
__label__1 I'm a big fan of desktop tower defense games and this is one of the best. The addition of levels past 20 really helped.
__label__0 Does not work on Atrix, gives a black screen for a minute and then force close messagen. Hope it will get fixed soon...
__label__1 I appreciate the work put into this kind of game. Simple and clean as phone games should be. Looks great on Nexus S.
__label__1 So simple yet so complex. Easy to learn, challenging to master. Love it because it's so much fun, hate it because I can't stop playing.
__label__1 This is a simple defense game that is easy to learn.  No tutorial needed, you'll be in and playing within seconds of hitting the icon.  And, despite its simple graphics and easy gameplay, the game is a lot of fun.  Prepare to be entertained for hours whe
__label__1 This game is great.  Hours of fun and a unique gameplay make Hex Defense a really great game.  I just recently finished beating all the levels on Hard and it was a good challenge.  Islands was the hardest.  I posted a YouTube clip of me beating that leve
__label__1 there is a free demo so try that first but this is def worth buying. no ads and lots of fun.i am not a robot or a paid reviewer.i just really like this game and i want the developer to get rich so he will make more interesting games.
__label__1 It's a pretty solid, but pretty standard, tower defense type game.What sets it apart, and in my opinion makes it better, are the awesome graphics.  In a simple but stylish way they really stand out and put this game above much of it's competition.If you 
__label__1 This game introduced me to the genre, and it is the most fun one I have played so far.  Pretty simple concept, but some of the levels took several tries.  Win once, and then turn the difficulty up.
__label__1 Run away from this game. You will be addicted!!!! I beat all the sets in both easy and hard. Now trying to get to 57000 in each level. i am almost there. need more levels.....gimme more now!! Please i really need a fix man!!!!! Please? No really.... I ha
__label__0 the game will not load so it is hard to rate it.  i have a view sconic gtablet running stock firmware.
__label__1 Very enjoyable game to pass a few minutes here and there.  I think the instructions need updating because it goes beyond 20 waves now.  Works great on my HTC Incredible.
__label__1 Would like to have more than 20 rounds, I was close to upgrading all my turrents to the max when I finished the stage. Also a feature to create your own stages would be cool too
__label__1 I thought it would be one time through and deleted. instead it's addictive as  hell. simple rules and deceptive yet flexible strategies.
__label__1 Lots of levels and super fun, definitely recommend it! Graphics are good too. It is a lot like that other defense game everybody loves, so if you like that you will love this.
__label__0 Not only is robo defense a better game but it doesn't lag. Tried playing this on my droid x running gingerbread and I had to give up because the lag was making the game un playable...to make matters worse it froze my phone and took forever to uninstall.
__label__1 Most enjoyable hex defense game I've tried, including better than Robo Defense in my opinion. Awesome graphics.Gameplay Hint: learn all about lasers.
__label__1 I like this great game. Simple drag and drop towers and tower upgrades. Clever placement of these towers and you've got it
__label__1 If you like tower defense games, you'll love this. Even if you don't, give this a try. Just about anyone could try this &amp; enjoy it. It's so simple, while also keeping you entertained from start to finish. Very good take on a genre that's been done a 
__label__0 this game is retarted. the graffix suck..the. music sucks..uninstalling now. droid x. i am very disappointed with how many people lied on the reviews
__label__1 Hex Defense has absolutely bowled me over with the great graphics and exciting gameplay. I'm a casual gamer but am finding this game to be so engrossing that I heartily recommend it even on a more basic phone like my Optimus V.
__label__1 I was just about the get the high score on hard for all levels. Now it's like a new game with all new challenges. Great upgrade!!! The New graphics are awesome!!!!!
__label__1 On Droid X...WOW!!!  Awesome graphics, vibrant colors, authentic sounds, good game play, engaging, pure destruction. :-)I don't like losing but the explosive sound and lighting special effects you put in at the end are really cool. Its almost like a cons
__label__1 This game is great! Runs so smooth on my EVO 4G, and is quite challenging from the get go! Really enjoy this game and would recommend it to anyone that is a fan of tower defense type games...
__label__1 Very addicting, nice game play, no bugs.  always a good way to spend some down time. more levels and towers please!
__label__1 Great game... Little hard to best levels but every level is beatable...just gotta find the right combo of towers...keep at it
__label__1 This is the best td game I have ever played on android. Highly highly highly suggest buying it! Do it now!
__label__1 This is the first game on my Android that I actually try to find time to play. It's fairly addicting.
__label__1 fun works great on optimus v. q w e r t h d s g h d g f j ff d h j d
__label__1 I got it on free day! Now that I understand the rules, I can see how it can become addictive. Great thinking game with simple but acceptable graphics. Thanks Amazon n Dev! EVO
__label__0 This game looks original and fun, but unfortunately doesn't run on the Motorola Atrix. It locks up on boot and the OS prompts to force close. Hope it's fixed soon!
__label__1 I love tower defense games. This one doesn't have the best graphics, buy makes up for it in game play. 8 bit style carnage. Very fun
__label__1 I usually don't like this kind of game as I find them either boring or too hard to enjoy.  I love this game though.  I couldn't stop playing it and didn't get enough sleep! I do wish there were more levels now though.
__label__0 unresponsive with fc at times on 925mhz nook color. gameplay unreasonably unballanced and needs to be tweaked. I could stand the fact that the game is unbalanced if it were not for the fact that its very addictive and because I couldn't get past the firs
__label__1 If you're having trouble installing on your DX, do a hard reboot and try it again. I can't stand to see the numerous amounts of reviews in the app markets by people giving low scores and sounding off about things like how an app won't install when that t
__label__1 This is not the kind of game I'd usually go for. But I took a chance and got this because I was interested in something different. Really, it's an addictive and interesting game. Hard in some ways, puzzling, strategic planning. I like it a lot.
__label__1 Very challenging, but can be played over and over.  Great graphics.  looking forward to more levels.  or Hexdefense 2.  worth the buy.
__label__0 does not work on moto atrix. never fully loads,  then have to force close. how about an update? some time soon may be? pretty please?
__label__1 Great stategy game that doesn't involve lots of time. Graphics are good but beware that a higher end device is needed for a smooth framerate especially when you have a screen full of towers and enemies. My Droid X lagged on some levels but still fun and 
__label__1 this is a solid game I keep coming back to even after having it for 3 months. tons of levels. good challenge and variety to it. I love the design and graphics, very clean and attractive yet simple and tasteful. oh, and it never crashes and works great on
__label__1 I'm not an avid gamer. In fact, I rarely spend enough time playing to complete a game, but HexDefense has claimed hours of my time aince being the Free App of the Day. Awesome graphics, challenging play, and great variety.The only negative to the game is
__label__0 This app will not install on my droid x. When I try to install it just says, &quot;app not installed.&quot; Looks like many others have had similar issues. Don't sell an app that's not compatible with so many devices.
__label__1 This game will make all other tower defense games super lame. Why? 1. Hex. Doesn't sound like much but makes you think a lot more and adds more variability in placement. 2. Pace of game is perfect, no need for a fast forward button. 3. music 4. No stupid
__label__1 I play this game all day never gets old I have played it on er and over great game play and level of difficulty
__label__1 This game will make you think... it's fun, engaging and graphics are old school asteroids style with flair!  Very well done and generous on gaming levels. One of the better tower defense games since Guns and Glory! Thanks for doing it right.
__label__0 Get a call/text and you lose your progress... Unacceptable!! Needs to be fixed ASAP! More stars once addressed... There's also no way to save your game...
__label__1 I love this game, and frequently still play it even though I downloaded it several months ago. Works great on my motorola droid (gen. 1) worth buying too!
__label__1 This game is very cool. I love the look of it because it's definitely a little different. I've had no problems with it. HTC - Incredible running Cyanogen 7. Amazon might want to rethink how old you can be to submit a review. Some of the bad reviews are j
__label__1 This game is worth twice the money!  Great game, great price, great fun, what are you waiting for?  Pay the buck and a half... (Not Even)... and have. FUN!
__label__1 So far this is my favorite Android game.  It plays well on my Xoom.  It requires some strategy, but also keeps you coming back to find the right way to beat each level.
__label__1 Very fun game. Took a long time to beat every level on hard and had a blast throughout the entire process. Hopefully there'll be more levels released in the future. Super addictive.
__label__1 this is best game ever.. i m still addict!!...ZDefense is suck... so lame!New HexDefense 2 is coming soon this year!!RoyG2 Gingerbread 2.3.4 stock, not root
__label__1 This was the free app of the day yesterday, and all I can say is, wow! It took about an hour to figure out how to play, and it was quite addicting from there! Awesome graphics and gameplay. The hours flew by while playing this game.
__label__1 Great game! No issues with tegra 2 on my Toshiba Thrive. Very addictive and runs great. Worth more than advertised. Highly recommended.
__label__0 Installed app on atrix.  Will not open, must force close to return phone to normal use.  Have installed it twice now with the same failure.  Will try again soon but for now... not five stars at all.
__label__1 Game is awesome! Need more levels, and the levels need a continuous option! One of the best defense games ive played
__label__1 this is alot of fun! please make more levels and more waves per level.  also a level editor would be great.  overall a great game
__label__0 it does not work on the motorola atrix, i'm glad i got it for free. it force closes every time i try to run it, it hangs my phone while it is trying to load. i like this kind of games that's why i got it
__label__1 If you've played any tower defense type of game, then you know how to play this game.  It's straight-forward and looks slick, even in its simplicity.  I've been playing for about 10 minutes and I'm already hooked.  It looks like there are 20 waves per st
__label__1 Hex Defense is a graphically simply yet powerful tower defense game with lots of challenging maps and upgrades. It's a great game for on the go play. I have spent many a lunch hour enjoying this title.
__label__1 Great, easily customizable content,  Also works great, even with &#34;special effects&#34; on my very low end tablet!  Content is organized great and the app looks great.
__label__1 Can't imagine a day w/o using this app. The layout/design is superb to find what I'm  looking for &amp; for what I didn't know  I wanted  to know. Installed  5/12(original kfire) &amp; have never had a problem. Highly recommended for it's Tech/ Business/

__label__0 Crashes at start. Everytime, all the time. I use a motorla atrix phone. That is all. I have completed word minimum now.
__label__0 Very disappointed that this isn't available for the Atrix. It says not compatible with lower end devices or the Atrix. Well, the Atrix sure isn't a low end device! I hope it becomes available some day. I would have liked to try this.
__label__1 This app is top notch for recording your dream and then recording your own analysis based on what is going on in your life. Well worth 1.99.

__label__1 as a Buddhist and meditator, this app is very useful. I also use it as a kind of journal for watching the mind and writing down insights gained in meditation. very well designed app.
__label__1 I use this app every morning when I wake up. I love all of the different sections it has for you to write about the dream you had. I also love all of the options on the different types of dreams that you had. There are over 10 types of dreams that you ca
__label__0 I was hoping that this app was more than just a journal. I was hoping it was also a dream analyzer or a dream dictionary. It's just a journal. The app Dream-e is at least a thousand times better.
__label__1 haven't used a dream journal before but this one is very detailed and easy to use I like that it can be password protected
__label__1 I love this! I've been chronicling my dreams for the past few nights. It's pretty damg amazing. The app suggests things to include in your dream summary as well as forces you to think more critically about what you experienced. This is a great app if you
__label__0 The app of the day is usually weak but this one takes the prize. Give me a break.  At least we have Superman's review. Keep.it up you're the only reason I come every day. The apps are useless.
__label__1 I didn't really need this app but the only reason I downloaded it was to test if it really doesn't work on Atrix as advertised. I am running a different rom on my Atrix,  currently on &quot;the dark side&quot; version 4.2. tested, works great, didn't fin
__label__0 I just woke up after having a cool ass dream and couldn't wait to log it in to my dream journal app. I opened up the app and got a little pop up that asked me to review the app. I closed it and was about to hit the &amp;#34;add&amp;#34;  button when I no
__label__1 This app is great to track of all my dream. It is amazing. When I wake up I put all the dreams I had that night in my dream journal. I love this app. Get this app. :)
__label__1 This is a real nice app to track your dreams. It is easy to use and even has a search option which useful when you have a lot of entries. I don't know why it says it isn't compatible with the Motorola ATRIX.  It works great on mine.
__label__1 I'm going to give this app the benefit of the doubt as far as functionality. I did install and run the app on my Motorola Atrix 4G which is running CyanogenMod7. I'm not what the compatibility problem the development experienced, but it seems to work fin
__label__1 I guess every one star rating has no bearing. it does what it says it does but it seems like they wanted an app that would suck the dream out of there head and place it gently on there android device. Its a free app thats all.
__label__0 this is a dumb app. Buy a dream book of you believe in that crap or just go to sleep and don't worry about it, seriously.
__label__0 Too much work to get the dreams down. I think writing them down would be more efficient.  Good ol pen and paper.
__label__1 I got this app thinking that by &quot;dream&quot;, it meant things that you wish would happen, but it turned out to be dream as in the visions you see at night. but I use it as both, and it's awesome! it aloes you to keep track of all your dreams, and it
__label__1 This is a great game if your kid likes to make journals. Your kid will fall in love with this game. my sister didn't even let me play it she loved it so much.

__label__1 I do have one suggestion.I don't like typing right when I wake up nor do I like writing.I use a voice recording program so all I have to do is talk out my dream when I wake up.later in the day I write it out, and then I read it before I go to bed.you sho

__label__1 it's not a rip-off of something else, or promising something it doesn't deliver! It's a dream JOURNAL. If you prefer pen &amp; paper, use it &amp; buy a dream interpretation app.
__label__1 1. This is a dream journal, it's named Dream Journal Pro to make its function obvious.  It's essentially a blank database you use to record your own data.2. It is no more a dream interpretation app than your calculator is.3. IMO, interpretating symbology
__label__1 For a person who does journal their dreams, this is a great convenience to having your journal right there without having to hunt down your journal or that pesky pen/pencil that rolls away off your nightstand. Rate the app, folks.
__label__1 I love this app its really good for telling people your dreams so when you wake up, you can type it down and tell your friends and family without saying &quot;and then, and, or um &quot; you can just read it to them and it will be super understanding!!! 
__label__1 It never said anywhere that it will interpret hour dreams, just help you try and interpret them for yourself. It would be nice to see a dream dictionary on there though.For the idiot complaining about a stolen image, go read the about page in the app, th
__label__0 How can they even think to put atrix in the same sentence as a low end device??? Atrix does not even carry the same classification, low memory, slow cpu, as a low end device. Whatever, this app seems like something you could do in quickoffice (which btw 
__label__1 this app is very simple down to the point. you record your dreams and review them for later. Device used: Kindle Fire
__label__1 love your app.  it has been very helpful in many ways.  hope many others get as much help as it has me :) have a blessed day / evening
__label__1 I've had some odd dreams lately,  glad I can record them!  I enjoy the part about not working with low end devices and the atrix... the atrix is pretty crappy lol, I'd classify it under the low end category.  its a Motorola,  Google didn't buy them for t

__label__1 This is the best app! It keeps my dreams in a journal, that I can refer to later. This app would be nice, if it had... meaning of the dreams or a dream dictionary!! Then it would make it more organized, without the need for other apps.
__label__0 this app is boring. sorry. wtf. do I really need an app to write down my dreams. It useful for folks that need it I guess. I downloaded it cause it was free and I thought it analyzed your  dreams. it doesn't
__label__1 very in depth questions help with dream analysis. makes you think about the dream. well thought out app. will update review after a week of use.
__label__1 this is one of the better slot games. it does not nag you to spend more money for coins on low paying slots or you need to wait hours to play again like so many other slots games out there. for that reason alone i give it 5 stars. i also like that it is 
__label__1 _I really love this game it gives all effects of being in the casino whether in AC or Las Vegas
__label__1 Great game for free time. Quick loading for fun while waiting in line. Multiple ways to get big returns and bonus games. Not overly advanced graphics, but not cheap and cheery either.

__label__0 The graphics of this app is very primative on my 8&quot; tablet running android 2.3.  Can 't even tell which line is a winner.  Look for something else.
__label__0 It looks like a game where you back up the car and move it around, but it isn't. It's the same is Unblock Me. For me, the description was misleading.
__label__0 Couldn't figure it out. Got bored trying over and over. My sister -in -law recommended it but this was different than her Nook app.
__label__0 this game ducks so bad it almost made me break my kindle! omg I hate this game it ducks so badly

__label__1 I have tried pretty much every Bible app I can find, and, honestly, I use this more than any other. Most Bible apps store highlights and notes on a server, and require you to be online, which always threw me off at church. My kindle fire doesn't have 3G,

__label__1 This Bible is exactly what I was looking for. It is simple enough that my 4 year old could use it without a problem. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a Bible application.
__label__1 LOVE LOVE LOVE...all the different functions of this Bible. It's audio, provides more than one version of the Bible as well. There is room for notes and more.
__label__0 The audio is really bad.  The voice is female, and very robotic sounding.  Adjusting the rate of speech does not eliminate the robotic voice effect, nor does it really slow it down.  I found the voice to be a distraction, so I uninstalled this app. If yo

__label__1 This bible is cool just for the fact you don't need to be online to use it plain and simple.

__label__1 I love this Bible!  OMG, this is wonderful.  I play it at night as I go to sleep and it has the full Old and New Testament in King James Version.  You can take notes, email scriptures and find your favorite Bible passages quickly.
__label__1 I love this Tecarta Bible App. I switch easily between several versions as I read, quickly able to compare the way different translations or paraphrases as I process spiritual truth. I often look the Scripture up in a different translation to compare. Wi
__label__1 I like this app especially when a preacher or teacher is using several Scriptures in his/her presentation. All you need to do is bring up the app, tap the book title and then the verse. So much easier and faster than flipping thru the Bible at a time lik
__label__1 This Bible app is one of many I have, and I'm using it almost exclusively because of the Commentary.  It's intelligent, balanced, and well-written.
__label__1 I needed a copy of the KJV for my study library and this version has a bunch of bells and whistles most people would also enjoy.  Works well on my Kindle and Windows system so I believe you can go wrong with this one!

__label__1 This bible rocks so much, i've never seen an error before, its identical to a printed bible. It has always served my biblical needs in any way, its got a few features but thats all it needs,a dn with this latest update it faster and better looking than e
__label__1 Easy to use. Cute highlighter colours. Easy to find texts and lighter than the actual Bible book for church. Download!!
__label__1 Best bible ever , because you don't need WiFi  connexion to read . Chapters change easily and crisp , no problems .
__label__1 The KJV has been the dominate translation for so long, that it is still the best starting point for any serious study. Even though the language is a bit archaic there has never been a more dependably accurate translation to English.
__label__1 It great it just what i need at night before i go to bed its greatest  app im the store
__label__1 This app does not need an internet connection in order for you to use it so it is ideal for all of the places you may want to read your Bible but have no access to a wi-fi network. Using the app could not be easier; click on the search box and the entire

__label__1 Love this Bible. Very good interaction. Can easily find texts. Love the fact that it can read the texts for you. The only drawback is that when the voice is reading and you want to stop andcome back to the same place,  you can't.  The voice will start ba

__label__1 When one doesn't have a KJV at hand, this application permits to keep reading the Word of God in a clear and easy fashion - whether online or offline (which is a huge plus). Plus the navigation through the scriptures is also quick and easy. I recommend t
__label__1 This app is one of the best Bible apps that I have used on my Kindle. I looked around and used others. This beat the other KJV Bibles. My husband is a minister, and I read the Word quite often. It put everything at my fingertips. The highlighting feature
__label__1 Very good Bible application. It is free, so why not? Also, you won't need WiFi just to open it. Of course you need WiFi to download it at first. I use this Bible all the time in Church. It also has margin notes so that you can add notes to a scripture an
__label__1 I chose this Bible as it was free and I am familiar with this version. I also want to purchase the NIV version as well as the NASB version.  Any version that will acquaint you with Jesus is a Good Bible.
__label__1 This app's strength is the ease of navigating to a particular scripture passage.  It's interface is both straight-forward and quick.
__label__1 This app is the best I have come across.  I use it at bible study all the time.  Thank you for this simple but effective app.
__label__1 I found it to be a very simple, easy to use Bible app. It has the night mode which I love (battery saving mode).
__label__1 I didn't think it would work but I've. enjoyed it very much. I. like it because when l am busy I can listen instead of reading.
__label__1 This is a great App. It is easy to use & has everything I need. I love being able to take notes & they will be right there with the verses I took the notes on. I'm forever loosing my notes or have the notes & forgot to put the book & verse they were for

__label__1 Love this Bible app. I use it on my Kindle Fire HD and haven't had any problems. The only thing lacking is not having the Strong's Concordance. Making notes are easy to do and I love that you can underline favorite verses. I use it at Church because I ca
__label__1 So glad I have this on my kindle fire. I really like the KJV bibles. I also have one on my other kindle and bring it to church also!!!
__label__1 Extremely easy to use. Better than any paper Bible. It is exactly what you need for quick search and reference. I love this Bible.
__label__1 Okay so this is a wonderfully app yeah sometimes you can't listen to it but that is why you go to church or get a recording I mean goodness gracious this isn't the only app out there but
__label__1 I have searched for a  good bible app. I finally  found it! This is by far the best I have found. I recommend this app for ANYone wanting a KJV bible. Mine is being used on  an Android phone and works beautifully.
__label__1 KJV Tecarta is a high quality app you can use to study Scripture, and because I don't want to really tear it apart and scrutinize the details, let me keep it simple; if you're looking for a nice mobile study tool for the Bible, try it out. There isn't an
__label__1 I love the app for all the bibles versions you have available. I've tried several and all were very pleasing. The highlighting and underline capabilities make it easy to remember and locate certain scriptures you want to keep in minding certain chapters.
__label__1 The King James Version is the best Bible to read there is none like it. Read the King James Version you will love it AMEN
__label__1 this app is a good Bible app. it has different types of bibles you can look at too. you can highlight texts and send scriptures that you like to freinds.
__label__0 the app did not work on the phone and I was not happy aout it because I wanted to read the bible
__label__1 I love the fact that you can parallel  with other versions of the bible. the side panel is great and perfect for in app note taking

__label__1 I've only had this bible app for a brief time, it's great so farIt did close on me twice when I first installed, but no more problems with itAfter that...I totally love the side by side bible books, so I can compare 2 translations at a timeAnd being able
__label__1 I like the fact that I can read it at anytime throughout the day. It is in an easily understood language
__label__1 I think this book is good in the way about how it uses the words that the people used then. I recommend this book for most religions
__label__1 I use this every Sunday in church on my Google Nexus 7 tablet. Real easy to use and quick to find verses. I don't use the note take though because it does not have an &#34;undo&#34; function. That's the only negative I've found thus far.
__label__1 But hard which one like that sound read story. So great God's praise, follow in our love and safe. But I am Superman are responsible hadit for help people from fear are not good.
__label__1 I recently got the Kindle Fire HDX 7.  I wanted to get an app that has the Word of God in it so that when I attend service I can use it to easily locate the books, chapters and verses quickly as the study directs.  This one is nice.  It does NOT require 
__label__1 Not what I was looking for.  There was some thing about this that I did not like and did not work well for me
__label__1 The Bible on my kindle makes it easier to follow the preacher during his sermon rather than having to thumb thru pages during the sermon.  Get to book, chapter and verse quickly and I like the way the verse you have searched is highlighted at first.
__label__1 It's great to be able to see the word of God on the Kindle. It is a great thing and I Love it.
__label__1 I really like this Bible because it is easy to find the scriptures I am looking for. It is easy to make notes an bookmarks the scriptures. I would definitely recommend it!
__label__1 This is a good bible that has very good  text looking speach.I read it with preacher's on TV shows everySunday
__label__1 Just wanted to have it always available even when I don't have the actual Bible with me. So much can be stored on my kindle that is very useful.
__label__1 This game was a lot of fun, great graphics. I downloaded the free version so it stopped after a few different levels but it was still pretty cool
__label__0 Same shots over and over.  No challenge.  Do not recommend it even for beginners.  Would recommend that other golf games be played.
__label__0 Its totally a waste of time. I'm gonna delete it like now. At least its free anyway. This game stinks. DO NOT INSTALL. STAY AWAYRT
__label__0 This game would have been bad in 1985 much less today.  Teh graphics stink and the play is awkward.  It is far outdated.  I wish there was a better golf app for my kindle fire than this.
__label__0 bad graphics, bad game play, not worth the 20 minutes i wasted trying to figure it out.  at least it was a free app.
__label__1 Wnderful for a free app.  Offers different kinds of study plans and different kinds of bibles to read from. Thanks
__label__0 This product is ok, but I found that it wasn't really what I was looking for. I'm sure that others will enjoy this product and find it very useful in meeting their needs.
__label__1 This is my go to Bible now. It's a modern English that is accurate and easy to read. I love it.
__label__1 This is an excellent version of the Bible in easy to understand modern English language.  Also this app does not require internet access to view the pages which is a plus.
__label__1 This is an easy to use translation of the Bible.  I enjoy the ability to browse to find just the right passage.
__label__1 So far I'm loving this bible!!! Very helpful with my independent studies of my newly found faith. Recommend for new believers who want to know more info behind almost every verse.
__label__1 Love this Bible and use it at church every Sunday. Easy to take notes while pastor is preaching. Love having sermon notes wherever I am.
__label__1 I could never put another version on the same level with my Cambridge Cameo KJV, of course you will understand, but I can say I am pleasantly surprised at the quality of this e-book.  Easy navigation and full functionality on my 1st gen Kindle Fire.  I m
__label__1 The My Bible app is great, but when I just want to read the ESV, which is usually my version of choice, I use this one.  I like it because it is simple and easy to read.  I also have Kindle Book versions of the ESV and ESV Study Bible, which are also gre
__label__1 This is one of the easiest to use Bible programs I have found the first one I downloaded had to have web access this one is good anywhere
__label__1 This is the best Bible app that there is on the kindle fire. I hade the you version Bible app but u cant read that unless u are connected to a wi-fi network.
__label__1 Any chance to read God's Holy Word, is a chance worth taking. To read it, in an understandable language, that keeps close to the original language, is always a good thing. While the King James is an excellent version, and we have that one, too, To use to
__label__1 This application is stable, it has never crashed on me, and is very intuitive.  This is the best application with the ESV version that I have used.  It is a joy to use on my Kindle Fire.
__label__1 We use this version of the Bible at our church.  I love it as much as I love my King James Version I have had since I was saved in the sixth grade.
__label__1 It'smuch easier to find books of the Bible and the refrences needed for church each Sunday.  This is the version most often used in my church.
__label__1 I love the fact that I can take notes and enlarge the print to the perfect size for my bad eyes. This is a wonderful app. Thanks
__label__1 Great reading app for my Kindle. Syncs perfectly, reads easily, and keeps my within easy access of my Scripture reading/study.
__label__1 As many of us do, we have a number of Bibles purchased over the years but left collecting dust because we find them too heavy, to hard to read or understand, or a myriad of other reason.  I found these issues solved by purchasing this Bible and keeping i
__label__1 Not much to say, other that this is my second favorite translation.  I like the NASB the best.  It does what I would like it to do.
__label__1 I downloaded this and so happy I did, it's easy to find the chapters and there is a reference page that you can get to very easily. The words are big enough for those that are far-sighted and comfortable even for those that don't . Love this version, any
__label__1 The app is easy to use.  I like the ESV edition.  The print is easy to read.  Finding Bible books within the Bible is very easy.
__label__1 THIS IS A GREAT APP FOR ANYBODY!! PROS & CONS: PROS:VERY GOOD CONTENT,YOU CAN HI-LITE ITEMS AND PUT THEM IN YOU FAVORITES! CONS: IT'S AN APP, NOT A BOOK,SO YOU WON'T FIND IT IN YOUR BOOK SECTION,ALSO YOU HAVE TO SCROLL DOWN, NOT TO THE SIDE,SO BEWARE, YO
__label__1 I downloaded this version because I like to read different versions of the Bible.  It is easy to navigate and I enjoy it.
__label__1 I use it often when I am reading the Bible or looking up a verse.  Had to get use of the language because I wasn't accustomed it.  It is easy to read and understand.  I have been reading the NIV for years and the Complete Jewish Bible.  So the ESV gives 
__label__1 On those days that I really don't want to lug around my very huge Bible, the ESV Bible comes in very handy as I can instead just take my Kindle to church.  The great thing is that I can also read this Bible on my Kindle on days other than just Sunday.  I
__label__1 This digi-Bible is absolutely the best I've seen. Having studied the ancient Hebrew, Chaldean, and Greek texts I was shocked at ti's accuracy. It even saved me a few times when I needed scriptures on the spot. Extremely pleased and I now have this on all

__label__1 This is very easy to use and understandable translation of the Bible.  It took me a few times to figure out how to use the notes correctly, but that is my issue and not a design issue.
__label__1 I really like this bible it is so easy to read and study with and with it being on the kindle it is ready any time any place
__label__1 I love this Bible and it is so easy to move around in and will be used a lot in my studies as a result. It is definitely very user friendly and I highly recommend it.I have only had this version of the Bible two days but I am already enjoying the use of 
__label__1 It took me several tries at finding a Bible on line that was easy to use and this is the one I like the best.  It is easy to use and can easily turn to several passages and back to your original passage with ease.
__label__1 This is a good bible for the free price, however it does not have the ability to change the font setting as you can in other books you download, so not a good choice for me. I contacted the company and their customer service explained to me how to find t
__label__1 THIS BIBLE IS JUST THAT A GOOD STUDY BIBLE ALONE BUT THE NICE THING IS THAT IT HAS PO[P UP NOTES TO DIRECT YOU TO OTHER PASSAGES. HIGHLY RECOMMEND.
__label__1 The Bible I own is ESV, so I wanted something to match the one I owned. This was the one I came across and chose. I have had this app for about five months now, and I love it. It is very simple to navigate, and you can highlight verses you like, add your
__label__0 Does not affect any dogs in my neighborhood,  so it is a waste of memory space on my device! Do not get this waste of time and space!
__label__0 let me summarize the reviews for you: this app is garbage. I didnt even have to try it to know that...
__label__0 I tried to use this on my dog and he just sat on my sisters lap and licked her hand. Terrible app. Don't get.
__label__0 downloaded it to see if it would work on my dog and nope. a complete waste of time and memory on my phone.
__label__0 Just like every one else, the stupid whistle would not shut up so I had to uninstall while it was blaring. Also, my dog had no response. I had this on my phone for about two minutes before the whistle got stuck.
__label__0 I have no recollection of ever having installed this app on my phone, though I am sure I did at some time.
__label__0 this app stinks I held it up to my ear and it hurt my ear really bad and my dog didn't wake up at all I had to call her to wake up
__label__1 Love it! You can change the frequencies and experiment! Nice job! My dog's ears perked right up. I had heard that teenagers could hear frequencies adults can't and this app proves it! Fun!
__label__1 My dog hates this but I love it. Helps him behave when he is not. What more is there to say!
__label__1 i hot this app and looked at how terrible the reviews are but then i looked at this one review and it said at 18000 its awesome and i got it and it was awesome
__label__0 what is this junk?! I held the speaker on my kindle fire right up to my dogs ears and she didn't even respond..... at all!!! I would have better luck getting a dog to roll over if I shot it down a hill. My mouth would work better than this. Looking to an
__label__1 I like messin with frends and gettin chased and jumped its all worth it so yea so yea and yea
__label__0 it didn't call my dog it just freaked him out . but I'm not one to talk it may not be the app it may be the dog
__label__1 Used it to train our dogs to limit their barking.  We would yell go home (meaning get back in the house and shut up) give a single toot on this horn and now they come in straight away without the whistle.
__label__0 does not work at all my aunts dog just sat there and was like &quot;whacha dooooin&quot; like he always does! he is sorta clueless but cute
__label__0 My dog heard it and looked up, but he stopped caring after 2 seconds. Oh and turning it off? Yeah that doesn't work. you have to turn your media volume all the way down or restart your phone. ATK didn't kill it either it wasn't even listed. I killed all 
__label__0 I got it out of curiosity to see how it would effect my animals they seemd to prop up their ears at first but then it was ignored.
__label__1 I really have no use for this other than to see who can hear it and who can't... as well as to really pester some of my close friends,but it's neat to see how high the pitch can go before you can't hear it, but please, show a little restraint when playin
__label__1 This app annoys young kids and dogs perfectly. There really isn't much else to say. You can shift through Hz and produce the perfect pitch to piss off anyone.
__label__1 Great because it works, bad because it hurts the dog's ears so you probably wont use it anyway. I had to give it five stars though because technically it does work, its just cruel to the dog.
__label__1 I really love this app dispite the fact it don't do it's job with the dog part. But it does work as a great prank....I remember when my classmate used this app in class....everyone was like &quot;What on earth is that sound?!&quot; It's more of an app to
__label__0 This doesnt even sound like a dog.  i wus expecting varios sounds like a chiwawa dog and a pit bull.  uninstaled emmediate.  save your money for sumthin else better!
__label__0 This did not work, I have two dogs and this did not phase them at all. It is a worthless app.
__label__0 Mostly, just an annoying program.  I tried it out on my dog, while asleep, and she didn't notice it at all.  It has an adjustable frequency, which I tried, and nothing in the range caused any reaction, except when the frequency got within human range and
__label__1 I loved it. it worked fine. but that might just be Cu's my dog is death in one ear and shes a dalmation but it worked great
__label__0 This isn't even a dog whistle! All it dose is hurt my dogs ears! Even Mine! It sucks And if I CAN hear a dog whistle its NOT a dig whistle!
__label__0 in my 3rd hour class my friend got really mad and cussed some people out in front of a teacher, all because of this annoying app
__label__0 this app gives me a headache,  #3 really..... i dnt really like it.... btw. i tried it on a dog... it didnt work
__label__0 my kindle froze with a constant buzzzzzzzz and my speakers kept popping! do not get. I had. 2 reboot and delete as soon as I opened it!!!@
__label__0 I dowloaded this the first time I tried it my speakers poping a lot even with no sound on, until I restarted my kindle fire.  I think that it could cause damage to the speakers.  No stars
__label__0 Awful garbage heap of an app. Had to see how bad it was, and it's just pure suck. I advise against it.
__label__0 I tested this out on my dog an  he didn't even notice  it. Horrible. Plus a dog whistle is supposed to be where only a dog can hear it, so why can I hear it too? Wierd order of pitches. don't get this app
__label__0 My wife installed this junk on her phone and started it.  It was so piercing and loud it hurt everyones hearing.  and heres the bonus: It wouldnt exit when she tried to stop it.  We had to shut her phone down to get it to stop.Avoid this app at all costs
__label__0 my sister uses it on my niece an I . we both hate it! works great on cats but not so much on my dog. DONT GET IT!
__label__1 my dog was asleep I put it on high Hz she jumped up it was.great! idk others say it don't work I.disagree
__label__0 did not effect the dogs was a waste of money,  hurt my ears.... would not recommend to buy or use.  Bla bla bla
__label__0 I would like to know how I can get paid to write idiotic five star reviews for POS apps that don't do anything except take your private information.  Give me 100 bucks and I will tell you this app allows you to fly to the moon!!!!
__label__0 at least it didnt work on my dogs, they acted like the never heard anything at all. its not worth the download
__label__1 I don't have this for my kindle but I used to have ot for my ipod. u have to change the sound a bit to where u cannot hear it. try it on a dog. I tried it on my dogs and they went beserk. it was kinda funny. they were barked their heads off and jumping a
__label__0 The only thing it works on is.. well nothing. Not sure what I was expecting but this was a flop.
__label__0 did not work on my dogs (12) chihuhua's . i tried all differant frequencies and volumes - it did not phase them.
__label__0 So after reading all the reviews of this app I have decided NOT to download it. Thank you to everyone for the info.
__label__1 Of course I didn't think it would do anything, especially with all the bad reviews.  But I was playing with my Kindle Fire and the dog in the apartment upstairs was crying for the last two hours.  So I grabbed the app, used it on a few frequencies, and h
__label__0 Simply put, my dog just sits there and looks at me, wondering why i'm clawing at my ears and waving my phone at him...does not work on this airdale.
__label__1 This is a pretty neat app. I wish it would go down to as low as 14 hertz. I would like to experiment with using the 14 to 16 hertz frequency as a healing tool. I wonder if any of these frequencies could be used as a rife machine. If you are unfamiliar wi
__label__1 this app is sooo cool. I love how it drives my dogs crazy! I think u should get the app it is the bomb digity!
__label__1 This is so fun to use to annoy the cats! Dogs didn't move but it turned my cats into Battle Cats!
__label__0 so i though to myself oh this would be a perfect way to train my dog...... it wasn't it hurt her ears (mine too) and she ran away........... so that's WHY YOU NEVER GET THIS CRAP
__label__0 I don't even have a dog. I can hear the whistle though. I thought the point of a dog whistle was that only dogs can hear it.
__label__0 you shouldnt even be allowed to publish this, let alone give it away for free...shame on you.  rating u on google app market next...
__label__0 i friend wanted to try it out n its sooo annoyin wen she plays wit it she does it rite to my ear n its soooo annoying it
__label__1 I'm on kindle fire and my dogs haul @2? to me when I play it great app, g bt. f f f u g l y
__label__0 I tried this just to see if it would work. Well, it didn't. It stinks. My dog freaked put then started crying ):Now everytime I bring out my kindle she runs and hides under the bed.
__label__0 My dog did not even raise a ear. Tried all settings.....nothing. I think its a joke myself. Stinks, hate it.
__label__0 Dogs don't react to it at all. Now I can understand it with the older dog...she is pretty deaf. But the younger dogs are in their prime and don't seem to hear it either. Giving the benefit of the doubt, it may be that you need a better speaker than comes
__label__0 This app drives my dog crazy, he just can't seem to understand where the sound is coming from. It's fun to watch and a good way to get his attention.
__label__0 nothing good to say. I thought maybe i could use this with my dogs. it does not work and takes up memory on my device.
__label__0 the first time i opened it and used it it got stuck in the on position and i had to remove my battery to make it stop...closing the app didnt stop the noise
__label__0 even for free it was a waste. when i changed the volume it never stayed the same. plus it wouldn't stop ringing annoyingly even after i deinstalled so to whoever has a kfire i warn stay away from this!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
__label__0 This app is so crappy it has to be someone's idea of a bad joke. Don't even waste your time.
__label__0 Tried this with my dogs... the corgi completely ignored it and the Pom just lokked at me... was it the whistle or that he wanted a treat?
__label__1 When I tried it out on my dog she woke right up and kept staring at my phone. I couldn't hear the tone at all, but she definitely could. I noticed that the only people this works for are the ones who have the Droid X, so in all likelihood the other devic
__label__0 The app gets stuck and continues to whistle until you force close the app. Also, the people that say this works are wrong. Dogs respond to ANY sounds. Buy a real dog whistle and you'll see the difference. Complete garbage and horrible programming.
__label__1 Freaked my dog out for a bit, then he just wanted to attack my Kindle.  Maybe I will wander around the neighborhood & try it out :D
__label__0 People amuse me! They get on here to rate the app. They complain about it &amp; tell the developer to fix it. On the install page, towards the bottom, (you might have to scroll down), you'll find an email address that you can use to ACTUALLY get in touch
__label__0 I got this on my kindle fire and it was terrible. the first time I tried to use it my dog didn't even look at me. don't waste your time on this app.
__label__1 If you feel your dog is losing hearing this is a greatapp not only to access the dogs level of hearing butan excellent tool to work with a dog that is sufferingfrom any amount of hearing loss.As an example my dog does not hear people coming up frombehind
__label__1 1650 is near the frequency that your parents can't hear, but you can. It drives your sibilings insane. Cool app, but I don' t use it for my dog.
__label__0 if you gave this more than one star which is minimum to complain, then you are fail, if you gave it 5 stars, then /wrist. I downloaded this out of curiosity and when my dog looked at me like I was an idiot, it got deleted
__label__0 This is a silly app. It make an annoying sound that wont turn off. Had to restart my phone. Then thought to myself, this is a pointless app anyways. Uninstalled... no good...
__label__1 My Rat Terrier is clicker trained and some time can't hear the clicker. I turn this whistle on and he comes running quickly, I makes me laugh.
__label__1 I just tested it on my room mate... OMG!!! she was looking around trying to figure out what she was hearing. she checked the Tv... looked more... I love this app!!!!! Though I am sure she will kill me if she ever finds out it was this app.
__label__0 If someone made an app for watching paint dry, Pocket Ants would appear on the list of suggestions.  And no, it doesn't look good.  The developer doesn't know how to write code based on screen geometry.  Consequently it looks ridiculous on a large screen
__label__1 It's stupid fun like popping bubble wrap. Will it tell you the meaning of life? Yes! Pointlessness is the key to life :)
__label__0 Just reading the description for this makes my skin crawl! Not the ants, but the perverse "pleasure" the developer must have had in making this. These people have some serious issues of their own. "...electrocute and drown the ants; blow the ants into yo
__label__0 This app is a waste of space. The interface is colorful but the lack of game objective makes it worthless. There is no visible mean to turn off the volume so the app stars at full blast. Not worth the &quot;free&quot; price.
__label__0 So, the game lets you kill virtual ants, and lots of them. Is there a goal? Nope. A point? Also nope. An interesting 2 minute diversion, but it probably won&apos;t hold your interest any longer than that.
__label__0 Normally I'm all for pointless things, but this gets old quick. Download it if it's free, but don't let it take up your memory space for too long.
__label__0 Basically its a sandbox, after 5 minutes you will never open the app again. Maybe for two year olds? Not even worth the free app of the day download.
__label__0 Right now this app is the alternative to Pocket God but soon, I don't know when, but soon Pocket God is coming to android and kindle fire.
__label__0 I know they're just pretend ants but it makes me sad that you're supposed to kill them. I was disappointed by the lack of helpful instructions. Was hoping for something better.
__label__0 There is an ant hill and there are all sorts of things you can do (anything you thought of as a kid, plus more like lasers and freeze rays) to the ants.  There is no point.  There is no score.  You just do stuff and see how the ants respond to it.In othe
__label__0 This is the stupidest app I've ever installed. Utterly pointless. People PAY for this normally?? I don't understand. It isn't even a game, really; it's an ant simulator. What??
__label__0 if only 0 stars where possible .. doesnt fill up my acer tablet.. and where u tap is not what u get.. dont waste ur time even dowhloading it .. even if it was compatible .. this is not a game this is a time waster for dummies..
__label__1 I would like it if you could make never ending holes for the ants to fall in. That would be awsome.
__label__0 Selecting the widgets to do things with was almost impossible.  While I might have gotten some amusement out of it, or kept it installed to amuse my three-year-old, not being able to select different tools without huge risk of accidentally hitting non-ga
__label__0 Seriously. What a total waste. I always feel bad for leaving a not so good review because people work hard developing applications... but there are just some times that one can't help it!This is a waste of time. Fun for the dev to claim they created some
__label__0 Had to try it, now I regret it.  My formal review of this "app" is that its not game.  Such advertising is a lie.  As others have said, there is no point or objectives to this thing.To make matters worse, it didn't take much to make it bog out.  Mixing e
__label__0 about a one min game. not worth a dollar, barely worth free app of day. works fine on my desire
__label__1 I didn't get this free... I paid for it a week after the Amazon giveaway (in spite of the spat of bad reviews)!  The folks that are remarking about it being pointless are probably not into the "Pocket God" genre of apps.  I'm a pretty busy guy, and I don
__label__0 Just what this country needs...an app that brings out the sadistic tendencies in children.  Cause I don't think adults would play it for much longer than a minute or two.  I agree with a previous poster...ZERO stars please.
__label__0 The graphics are great, but there needs to be a series of obvectives to complete; entirely open gameplay gets boring really fast--boring enough to not even be a good time waster.
__label__0 I got this for free, and I thought my kid would like it, but it requests too many privileges to safely install.  Why would it need the ability to change global system settings?
__label__1 It's an ant-torturing time waster, not a full fledged game people!It works great, and is actually pretty fun and very well made. You basically play god with two hoards of ants.There is no point, there is no beating the game. Just like other casual time w
__label__0 glad it was the free game of the day cuz i got what i paid for...  lol.  lil boys might like it, but then again theyd have more fun frying real ants...
__label__1 I love it, and it's one of the best apps on my kindle. It cerntainly is very fun and a good game to play when you have nothing else to do. the only thing I don't understand is the difference between the 99 cent version and the free version. If you like k
__label__1 This app is totally worth buying or getting the free version. During the game you have a choice of using path, fire, ice, spider, and many other objects. Do you want to make your red and black ants live together happily or do you want them to fight again
__label__0 Does not scale correctly on the zoom tablet as another reviewer posted. with so many good apps that work on both phone and tablet this is just bad development.
__label__0 I had this gAme on my kindle fire and it was great. My kids loved it  but this time I got the game and it will not down load. I don't understand. My kids are upset that they cannot kill the ants. Because they do not like ants and a game is better then th
__label__0 it seems like a nice game but is does not display correctly in my g slate. Need to work on that. Otherwise nice gameplay

__label__0 When touching the screen, the game moves from side to side, which makes it extremely difficult to tap on any found items. Hopefully there is an update in the future.
__label__1 HTC evo.  Love this hidden object game, but it can definitely cause eye strain because I can't put it down when I start!  its addictive!  A hint ability in the mini puzzles, or maybe even instructions for them would be nice.  would love to see more games
__label__1 Beautiful graphics, works flawlessly on my Incredible. Well worth the money.  If you're a fan of HOGs, this won't disappoint!
__label__0 I downloaded this game to my kindle fire HD and it comes up in a tiny screen.  It does not load full screen with items to find list or the hint button or anything else there might be.  Any fixes for this game for the kindle fire HD?
__label__0 This game is so packed full of problems and constant BS. I HATED it. None of the little stupid side games worked, and if I wanted a book I would have bought a FREAKING BOOK!!!!
__label__0 This game keeps crashing at the same place every time I try to play it. I have had no issues with any other game I've played -- including other hidden object games -- this one is just not working for me. I'm on a Samsung Galaxy Tab.
__label__0 This looks to be a great game,however the minigames do not work on my Evolution 4g or my Flyer.They load but the area where the game is supposed to take place is blank.I can wait till the timer runs out and proceed with some portions of the game,but wher
__label__1 Awesome game!! well worth the money for those that like sodden objects. Works great on my Droid Charge! Not really sure why there are so many bad reviews. This game is very entertaining .
__label__0 On my Droid Global the app keeps shutting down.  Then, when you go back in, it returns to the beginning rather than where you left off.  Will uninstall immediately.
__label__0 Everytime I leave the game I have to start all over. Looks like a good game, but who whats to start at the beginning each time? I have not found a way to save the game.
__label__1 Love this game, simple point and click sort of old school interface. I am still looking for more games along this mystery sort of genre.
__label__0 constant force close on the droid 2.  I haven't even gotten to playing the game and it has already force closed on me twice. don't waste your money on this app.
__label__0 My tablet/software would not allow this product to download.  So I can't tell you if the product is good or not.
__label__1 This app is real good and let you keep your numbers you should try it out is the best that I see in it is very good
__label__0 Forces you to sync with a google account. I'm not giving google all of my contacts' info! Needs to have another option, such as "phone" or "tablet" like a real contact book.
__label__0 Title says it all. It wouldnt load, or it just didnt work. I dont know, Ive downloaded other things. I think this was something I just deleted straight away.
__label__0 This is not straight forward tool., tooo complex. Certifiably not user friendly.  instructions were not really available.  of no use to me.
__label__1 What a fun time to pass the hours! Get help to learn and be quick on the call.  playing against virtual opponents was fun, at least on easy!\n
__label__0 Wouldn't install and when it did it locked up my system. There are  afew bugs in it. The author needs to fix the minor problems..
__label__0 I'm so frustrated with this game  I've downloaded and unistalled 2 times and I still can't get it to work the reviews looked good and I really wanted to play but I guess I'll have to find a different one.
__label__0 I feel bad for the retardedcraps who created this horrific thing don't get this app or you will end up as one of those craps
__label__1 The title pretty much sums it up. 20 word minimum 20 word minimum 20 word minimum 20 word minimum 20 word minimum.
__label__1 if you want a good app go to istunt 2 it's great or pacsnake or quell ok that's all I have to say la la la la.

__label__1 I love this application.  Very easy to use.  I love that you can set multiple timers.  Previously I had one Alarm Application and one Timer Application.  This allows me to have one app that does it all!
__label__1 I got this  pro app free as the free amazon app of the day. Before that I had the free version and liked it. The pro is great. It does everything I need it to.
__label__1 The alarm clock works great. volume's loud enough to make you get out of bed. And you can set the duration for as short or as long as you want. without any intervals of 5 min or 5 sec. :))))))
__label__1 I use this mostly for alarms. It reminds me to take my meds. It reminds me of tasks I need to complete during the day. Love the sleep feature. I have tried several apps and like this one best.
__label__1 This app does it all....  timers,  alarms, speech-enhanced announcements you type in yourself, stopwatch, icons to visually enhance your selections, fade-in options,  ETC!  Super-simple interface is easier to use than all the other alarm-type apps I've t
__label__1 Very handy app. I do wish that the second-level interface had a large start/stop button on each timer or alarm.
__label__1 A lot, apparently - more than I ever would have guessed.First of all I tried this on my 1st gen Kindle Fire and have yet to have a problem. Some features like vibration are obviously not going to work, and you have to remember that for an alarm to go off
__label__1 This is a great timer. You can have multiple timers saved. I love the trigger function. You set one timer to trigger another, start the first one and the second one starts as soon as the first one goes off. I see this being very useful. The stopwatch and
__label__1 This app is very useful for me. I use it to remind myself that I have a task that is ready in the MMO that I play. I can do the task once a day on each of my characters, so I have to wait 24 hours before I can do the task again.
__label__1 Multiple timers that can be used simultaneously! I adore this app, and use it every day for cooking. Five stars!
__label__0 if I don't wanna use an app everyday I want to be able to turn off the startupUNINSTALLED
__label__1 this works great on my kindle fire! I use it every morning as my alarm clock. I pretty much use it all the time for timers for dinner or to remind me of something! I love that you can use your own ringtones.  With the exception of the calendar this is my
__label__1 Great app to keep track of the many things we do during the day. Such as work breaks, lunch, laundry, and cooking.
__label__1 I have stopped using the alarm on my tablet and now use Timers4Me plus. More to this app than just an alarm clock though. I have nothing negative to say about it. I like having so many choices for ring tones plus it speaks whatever you label the alarm. S
__label__1 I downloaded it as the free app of the day.  I like that I can have different times going at the same time.  I use it at work for different projects.  Easy to set up and use.
__label__1 Got a friend retiring; we're counting down days to retirement.  Days to the birthday?  Counting them down.  Awesome little app.
__label__1 This is a great app.  You can set alarms, or do countdown.  (My kids already have a countdown to Christmas.)  Much used in out house.
__label__1 I haven't got to use every timer yet but I am looking forward to using this on a daily basis.
__label__1 This has so much, it's simply amazing!!. It has built in Timmer, Alarm, Stopwatch, etc, but you can use it for: Work outs, Reminders, Cooking, Races, and so much more!. I don't think they missed a thing with options Oo. It has so many options it will mak

__label__1 I use this app all the time.  It is outstanding if you need an alarm or timer.  Excellent - highly recommended.
__label__1 An extremely versatile set of clocks, alarms & timers.  And it's easy to keep them separated so you can quickly set an alarm without accidentally setting a timer instead.  Also easy to set which days for the alarm to go off.  The timer is handy for remin
__label__1 Nice, neat, smooth and very customisable. I like! Would suggest a bigger start button. As big as the Dismiss button....
__label__1 I'm addicted to my watch, and I use the stopwatch and timer all the time. But, you can only run one at a time. That is where this really shines, the ability to run multiple timers at once. The app is intuitive and easy to use. I love it!! I do wish it co
__label__1 I first started playing with electronic timers back in... well in the old days we had to build them ourselves...this is the first time I have a timer that I can use easily and works the way my brain works when processing things like lap times... why has 
__label__1 You want timers? You want a super stopwatch? Don't look any further. This application might be considered to be the epitome of anything to do with time. The graphics and smooth flow make this a real keeper. Time is of the essence, and the essence of time
__label__1 I use this app all the time. I like that I can save timers or alarms I use frequently. This is useful for timing food, reminding me when to give another dose of medicine, or keeping track of how long my kids have been working on their rooms. This is a gr
__label__1 This app is very easy to use ,customizable and handy. I use it when I cook ,exercise, nap, and many other times. It always keeps me on track. I can't say enough a bout it. This is a keeper.
__label__1 EXCELLENT timer app!  Tried a few others and this is by far the best.  The ability to have all the timers I'll ever need preset and ready to use is what makes this app great.  Works perfectly on my Note 2 when other timer apps didn't.
__label__1 The Timers4Me is an excellent app that I installed on my smart phone. It is great looking as well as very user friendly. I almost always carry my cell phone with me, so I always have a work, kitchen and nap timer and stop watch with me. It's great and I

__label__1 I love this!  I usually time everything and this gives me the opportunity to have several timers going at the same time.  I use this every day.
__label__1 But I don't know what I dislike about it. Lots of alarms and timers. I don't know what all of the buttons do, but haven't really tried to figure them out either.
__label__1 4-22-13 -- This app has many options and I expected it to be hard to navigate, but to my surprise I found it very intuitive and a snap to program.  The alarm part seems to be only in military time, but this is fine with me as it is more efficient and eas
__label__1 It requires phone abilities is because there is a feature on the app that makes it possible to alert you while in a phone call or not. It also has plenty of other features including a talk to you future.
__label__1 Bought this app to use while I grill.  So far it has timed BBQ chicken, ribs, steak, burgers, and sausages.  No issues with crashing or anything else.  Great app.
__label__1 I've tried at least 3 other timers and this was the only one that allowed me to set it up so that I could open it and choose from several different timer settings that I previously set. Just hit a button or 2 and off it went. I have them set for 3,5, and
__label__1 This is a great tool. Very handy to have around for laundry, cooking, etc.  Love the customization options, particularly speaking the alarm name.
__label__1 I cannot attest to some of the other reviewed comments abt this app not working on the Kindle Fire. Perhaps they had an earlier version. I got mine around the June 2012 timeframe if you want a time stamp and this app works great for me. I use it as an al
__label__0 As with Greg H. my Kindle Fire closes when the timer gets to zero. I love the app on my Droid Charge.4/25/2012 - Got an alert that the issue was corrected so I fired up the app (or tried to) and I was told that I no longer have the app, but that I could

__label__1 This was a free app of the day.  I've got other timers on my phone but this one beats them.  I have used this numerous times since downloading.  Comes in hand for just about everything! I'm giving it 5 stars because I like it.
__label__1 A wide variety of alarms, from sounds to music, plus the ability to set both alarms for specific times and timers for any length of time, make this one of my most used apps. I have half a dozen recurring alarms set after just a few weeks' use. My only co
__label__1 I enjoy seeing multiple timers. You can time your oven while jogging up and down the street among other uses.

__label__1 I am constantly using the timers. I use them to time therapy sessions, while cooking,etc. The alarms are loud enough to wake this sound sleeper.
__label__1 This app is really nice. It's easy and very efficient. I'm always forgetting something, so I preprogram what I need to do or remember, and it takes care of the rest. I do wish that I could use my own music with it, but it's not because you can't, I just 
__label__1 I use this daily for my alarm clock and love that you can personalisewhat it says for you to wake up to. It helps make sure that I am reminded of why I need to get up early.
__label__1 I use this for my son. He has autism and the timer helps keep him on task. Its easy to set and use.
__label__0 The dominoes are way too small...  For the price that they supposedly get people to pay, it is a ridiculous rip off!!!
__label__0 it really* really* sucks! it doesn't give any instructions on how to play! leaving me clueless the whole game and I lost every round because it didn't make any freaking scents. so consumers, don't waste your time or you amazon kindles gigabytes. . . its 
__label__1 I took the advice of another reviewer and read the instructions...believe me it makes a world of difference.  I'm not a big dominoes fan, but this was a lot of fun!
__label__1 This is a very good Rugby game but did anyone notice the goitch where if u press play the players and take turn into dominoes this amazed me
__label__0 Doesn't explain how points are earned.i'm new to dominoes so not understanding how one move gets you 65 when most gives you zero and the auto player always seems to score just doesn't seem fair. Maybe a tutorial or hints button to help you learn?
__label__1 hay Thor's who want an update thence give it a 5it only gets better if it has 50 or 5. 5 stars this do this with every game that stinks give it a 5
__label__0 They do not include customizable features, they don't highlight dominoes that you can play, and they don't have online player to online player playing. These are things that most free apps come standard with.
__label__0 Very simple game, would be better with 4 players. Hard to manipulate (have to &quot;hold&quot; the hover carefully or you lose the highlighted tile). Hard to see things. Played 1 game, that's all it took to know I won't play it again. Uninstalled it. But
__label__1 This is a good game and I and my husband like playing it.  It is difficult to get it to stick to the tiles once in awhile, but I guess I just need to work it better.
__label__0 I agree the tiles are too small. played two games and I am done. I do not recommend this game.
__label__0 It can take four or five tries to place a bone. It is not worth the effort. I uninstalled it after one game.
__label__1 the game works great with no issues dropping bones on legal moves.i would agree with others that its not noob friendly as to explaining scoring and how to play.
__label__0 The dominoes are miniscule!! And they won't stick!! That's the whole game!! They need to patch this thing up. Not good even for free!
__label__1 fun dominoe game if you can keep a connection. it does tend to be a little slow to load on the tablet sometimes and it is hard to find another player to play with but once you do it is game on! I enjoy this on the tablet.
__label__0 The game scores almost every time. I got tired of playing after a few games and removed this junk.  ive read of other players saying the same thing.
__label__1 Another great APP with a game I've played a lot while waiting here and there.  It can be addicting.  Not sure I understand the scoring part of it & why I keep losing most of the time, but enjoy the distraction of the game.
__label__1 For anyone who has played dominoes - and as others have said - those who bother to read the instructions, this was great fun. My eyesight is awful but I had no problem in seeing the dominoes.The Ai was competent, and let's face it: the odds will always t
__label__1 I think this game is great I love itttttttttt it is so cool you need to try it. I love it from the start
__label__0 Domino vet of 27 years. In just several play throughs computer manages come backs equivalent to getting 2 royal flushes.  Whether this is intended to challenge players of all skill sets or not, don't expect realistic play.
__label__0 This app isn't worth the download. The pieces are tiny and the computer always gets the points. There are much better apps out there.
__label__0 I couldn't even place one domino.  Complete waste of my time.  I'm glad I didn't have to pay for it.
__label__1 its ok I like it that's all I haft to say this is so its 20 worlds I I I I I I I I I I
__label__0 I am giving this app 1 star because tittle does not have a two player mode. What game of dominoes doesn't??
__label__1 thank you for teaching me to play dominoes. I always wanted to learn. I played straight 3 hours before I finally won, but it was fun! IMO, needs win/lose percentage tracking, and multi player would make it better.
__label__1 Plain and simple, I love Dominoes. Nothing intricate here, just a simple game of Dominoes. I play it all the time. If I had paid for it, I would have definitely made a return on my investment by now. It was FAOTD so there you go.
__label__1 DominoesI read the Jackass reviews on this game and hesitantly downloaded this old favorite pastime game.  The game worked fine for me (on The Fire) but....hey!...I cheated.  I read the instructions on the menu!Okay.  The tile placement is tricky.  Try t
__label__1 Who hasn't sat in a park on some sunny afternoon and played Dominoes the way it was meant to be played? Unfortunately, you can't line them on end and tip them over ;)
__label__1 This is great on kindle fire. This is a game I played as a kid and it is good for people who like strategy or puzzle games. The tiles just have to be placed over the tile that you want to play on. When it glows green it is in place. I will play this one 
__label__0 The game would have been ok if it wasn't for the tiny tiles. You have to have 20/20 vision to play this game. I don't call straining eyes having fun. Amazon can keep this game, it's even cheaper then free.
__label__0 Please save yourself some headache. Do not trouble with this for the download, it is poorly developed software.there is nothing good of this unit.
__label__0 At one point I was playing and the chain was so long that I couldn't see what I could play. Wouldn't zoom in or out, wouldn't move side to side, nothing. Very poor planning. Uninstall!!
__label__0 After playing 4 or 5 games, reading the instructions and going on line and reading how to score I'm convinced the AI is cheating!
__label__1 Amazed at all of the posers that think they can be SM75.  Be original people!  Seriously, how many pizza reviews are you going to write?
__label__0 This game was way off on touching and moving dominoes its wayyyy too small and will not let you move tiles around! I do not recommend this game to anyone.
__label__0 this app I downloaded it to see if the other reviews were true they were!!! the dominos are tiny even on my kindle fire it was ridiculous!!! it was very irritating!!!!!!!!!
__label__1 Another version of the popular game.  I came back to it recently and this one is easy to use and challenging.
__label__0 I love dominoes,  but this is a bad app. dice are wayyyyy to small, even on the fire. glad it was the daily freeborn.....already uninstalled.
__label__0 the screen is very cluttered and it seems like illegal moves are allowed, it's also difficult to figure out what does what. I'm not even sure of the rules anymore. Uninstalled - Droid 3 running Android 4.0.3 ICS by Hashcode
__label__1 Game plays well. I'm not sure why such low ratings by other reviewers. I played three games with no problems.
__label__0 drag the tile doesn't stay the dominoes are to small just needs work another crappy faotd what's up with the past couple of stinkers
__label__1 I can't get the dominoes to stand on their sides for placement in a dominoe train. The best part of dominoes is setting them up to knock them down! Please update with this ability. Thanks.
__label__1 I love dominoes and once you get the hang of placing the dominoes this game is fantastic. I struggled in the beginning because the domino wouldn't stay where I put it especially on the right side of the screen, I don't know why, but you have to put your 
__label__1 If I were to change anything it would be to highlight the tile you just drew to make it easier, but the game is still a lot of fun
__label__0 The user interface is absolutely terrible. It's very difficult to turn dominos or place them where I want them to go. Also the program will not let me make some legal moves. This program needs a lot of work and I have no clue how amazon thought it was go
__label__1 I don't know why I bother reading these reviews, I love how Karen put it though. You said it best Karen! READ THE DAM INSTRUCTIONS PEOPLE! The game works great on my Nookcolor.
__label__0 whats up with the kiddie, wimpy, buggy games this month? Come on! We DO spend money on aps we like, the least you could do is give us a great faotd on a reguar basis... we are the ones giving you good ratings when deserved!

__label__1 Palm user for years. Less than 5 minutes, and I'm already faster than SwiftKeyX or Swype. This is a dream come true for old palm users.And honestly, if you're of the fat finger persuasion, even if you're not 'an old palm user', this can seriously speed u
__label__1 Memories of old Palm. Thank you for giving me another input option. I do love swype but sometimes my fingers are too dry from rubbing/swyping so much. So, as silly as it maybe I will rotate my input methods.  Tapping letters in swype is at times annoying
__label__1 There is a decent learning curve. Once you get past that, but it's great! Accuracy is good and improves with use. It is as fast or faster than regular tap to type keyboards. Well worth $2.99!
__label__1 I was a long time Palm Pilot user &amp; loved Graffiti.  This app works perfectly &amp; I can input text so much faster than using a keyboard.  Text prediction is good &amp; gives several options to choose from. I have an HTC Incredible &amp; use my fing
__label__1 I'm chuckling at all the reviews complaining that this app won't let you cross your "t"s or dot your "i"s. That's not the way it's supposed  to work, kids!This is a really nice implementation of the Graffiti input method used in the Palm family of device
__label__1 I used to be really fast at Inputing graffiti. It'll take some practice to get good with it again, but i think it wil be well worth it. Thanks for this great app!
__label__1 I've installed Graffiti Pro with low expectations, but after a simple configuration I was able to jot down immediately, fast and accurately as I used to do with my last Palm TX. I wouldn't recommend it for newbies but if you're comfortable using graffiti
__label__1 So, I'm not a big fan of this app. So why the five stars? Well, it delivers on what it is says it is. I did install this for a day for a nostalgic stroll down memory lane (yeah, I was an old-time, long-time palm user) but it really isn't the quickest way
__label__0 The recognition system isnt broken like some claim, its just nonsensical. E, k, q, v, x and y are some letters it frequently had trouble with, and it was because of how it handled input for these letters. I guess if you spend the time to acquiant yoursel
__label__0 because it's hard to trust an app when all of the positive reviews read like a marketing ad.  I thought it was against the rules for developers to falsify reviews!  If your product is good, then why not let it stand by its own merit?
__label__1 I did not know about this app or I would have gotten months ago!I have really missed my Palm and Graffiti...  I have not gotten the hang of typing on a virtual keyboard or Swyping successfully.  I so often do not write what I meant to and then the mis-wr
__label__1 this app is quickiy growing on me.  i am finding that i would rather use this than a regular keyboard. this seems to be a little more natural than typing.
__label__1 It was nice to revisit my palm pilot days. And it's definitely better than a straight keyboard. My favorite input app remains SwiftKey because I rarely need to type more than 1 or 2 character to complete a word. If Graffiti added a more intuitive auto co
__label__1 This is an awesome app.  After I unlearn the other handwriting strokes, this will be much faster.  And I won't get Droided (when the Droid prediction changes the word and you don't catch it) quite as often.Graffitti was great on the old Palms.
__label__0 I really thought this would be useful but its not. I tex faster using this keyboard not some b.s. drawing lines that don't even show the correct letter u are using ain't that some. I deleted it so disgusted with it.
__label__0 What a useless app. So many other full featured, free apps out there. This one. is 5 year old tech. Swipe and voice recognize text is so much easier. AND THEY ARE FREE
__label__0 I see that it checks license "from time to time" - on a critical app? I have many paid apps and have never seen this. I would like to give it a try, but not with DRM!
__label__0 Based soley on its viability, you just can't give this app a high rating. I guess I can see why somebody might...if they came out with a mike tyson's punch out app tomorrow, I'd rate it pretty high. Knowing full well that its old, outdated, and weaker th
__label__1 Palm abandoned me when they went to PalmOS, killing thousands of applications. I bought a Droid and discoverd Swype. Now in a perfect world, Swype should be faster, but with my wide hands and thick fingers, I can't see the keyboard and I don't hit the le
__label__1 If you used Graffiti before you will find this is a well done app. It may be easier to learn on this app than the Palm if you don't know the method. It's great to have choices and this gives you another one. PS stroke up and off the input area to see the
__label__1 If you were good at Graffiti back when Palm ruled, this is for you.  If not, then one of the other alternatives is probably better for you.Overall it works very well and is well thought out.  At this point I prefer it to the other Android keyboards I've 
__label__1 Just installed a few minutes ago and without reading any instructions figured out all but about 3 letters which were logical moves quickly learned from the character map.  This my first smartphone so I have no previous experience with Graffiti.  I was a 
__label__1 i have never used this input method before. it took me about 20 minutes of doing texts, updating Facebook and posting on Twitter to master this app. i really like it now. it really only takes a bit to learn, you really only have to remember where to star
__label__1 spent all day with it and just can't seem to make it work for me. add a space and back button and I'd be thrilled. seems like if you were a fan of the palm OS this would be heaven but alas I was not. Giving it 5 to counter the re-re's that blast an app b
__label__1 I love this game. I am a big fan of logic puzzles so this is perfect for me. Nice relaxing music too. Recommend if you like logic games.
__label__0 This game Sucks. It has nothing to do with the game of dominoes. Give us a domino game that we can sit and enjoy.
__label__1 this game is not to hard, but not all that easy either. It's great for passing time. Download it it works great for kindle fire give it a try u just might like it.
__label__1 I like this game. its fun and excercises my brain in the morning. I would reccomend it as its free.
__label__1 I like this game. Most games I play, though entertaining, usually seem to be following a trend of some kind... This is not the case! The music is soothing, and game-play logical &amp; straight-forward. People that claim it's &quot;too easy&quot; probably
__label__0 All of the dominoes are in the pattern...Okay well, the pattern is pretty small and it isn't all that hard to figure out. IF you just wander along marking two spaces at a time the most you're likely to have decide between is one or two place where you sh
__label__0 I could not figure this one out.  I could  or could not recommend it because I wasn't sure how to play the game.
__label__0 I don't get the game. It's not entertaining. Just give me regular dominoes. That's all I want. I downloaded this game, attempted it and then immediately removed it from my device.
__label__0 Its ok... but I thought it was a regular domino app! Eehh can do without it! I will try another!
__label__0 This is not the traditional game.  ONe doesn't play against the computer (or another). but rather have to 'Match'  tiles.  Will be returned.
__label__0 1 it's boarding.2 it does not stick to it's on rule.2 you can get a virus with the down load.
__label__1 I really missed old dominoes game from the 90s. I finally found an app for dominoes.Thanks for the free game.
__label__1 I was looking for a job and stumbled across this app. It was very helpful,hope it is helpful for your job search.
__label__0 I used this for about 30 seconds before I just decided to use my laptop. Clunky and confusing to use.
__label__1 Optimus v  for those of you that cant get it to work its a widget not an app there is a huge differance
__label__0 Worked very sporadically on my Droid X. Had to reboot the phone several times due to lock-ups. Also found it difficult to uninstall. Foxfi worked a lot better (even though Foxfi's free version is data-limited.
__label__1 I couldn't see paying for the Tether product, especially with the reviews for my phone. on the other hand, I really wanted to be able to hook up my Nook on the go if I lent my WiFi card to my grandson (the price of family). In any event, I downloaded the
__label__1 I am so happy to have finally got an application that works for my Toshiba Thrive! Connecting my phone is great, super easy and fast. Would have paid for this. I paid $10 for easy tether and it only connects via usb cables, no hot spot. Which meant I cou
__label__1 Ok, it is just a widget.  But, it places tethering right on your home screen.  A &quot;must have&quot; for Android phones.
__label__1 Honestly, it's not difficult to tap the description and read the key points to this WIDGET. Not an app, and will not magically make your phone capable of making it a wifi hotspot if it wasn't capable of it in the first place. If you don't have the tether
__label__1 if you're looking for free tethering for your verizon wireless handheld get PDAnet. there is a charge for secure sites, but how I get around that is don't sign out of the page. and plus $16 one time fee for full pda net is way better than what VZW charge
__label__1 I've been using a different tether app for over a year now but it's gotten sluggish and unreliable with recent updates so I decided to try this one since it's free. I honestly wasn't expecting much due to the price but this app works great. It's very sim
__label__0 With the new Over-The-Air update, HTC Thunderbolts have their WiFi Hotspot feature disabled, so downloading this app was an attempt to get that functionality back to some degree. Perhaps it is the Verizon TetherGuard process on the phone that prevents it
__label__1 Giving 5 start review just to help counter the 1 start idiots who don't know how there phone/service works. Widget does EXACTLY what it says it does.
__label__1 17 one star reviews. All because they couldn't read. This works WITH carrier paid tethering. If you don't pay for tethering this app is likely to be worthless to you. If you want a work around then root your phone. Or get pdanet.
__label__0 It didn't work with my phone.  I have an Evo 4g, and it just wouldn't do what it was supposed to do.
__label__1 Using LG Optimus V on Virgin Mobile. No setup required. Just turn it on and let your wifi device find it. If you want you can add some security.
__label__0 You will not get free wifi with this app. My droid x w/ verizon asks you yo pay for the service.
__label__0 Don't work !!!!!maby if you use a flash Rom or somthing like that  I have a regular htc evo and it say I don't have hot spot services  when I open - 1star...lol
__label__1 Widget works great couldnt ask for better for something thats free. If you dont like it, your not using it right!
__label__1 Using this with my Motorola Xoom tablet. Makes it so much easier to get online since I only bought the one with wifi.
__label__0 Doesn't work on my Sprint Epic Galaxy S phone.  Every time I bring up the wifi, it stops after about three seconds and says &quot;Registration Error: Your Sprint data service username and password may be incorrect.  Please try again.&quot;  Well, I've tr
__label__1 Tethering widget works very easily and does great at setting up mobile hotspots. However the usb tethering does not work, which I think is because you would have to root the phone to get that type of tethering without drivers. That's ok for me though, be
__label__0 This application never did work, I tried it numerous times and the results were all the same, did not work.
__label__1 And no, you don't absolutely have to have tether set up through your provider, unless you're one of those unfortunate people with a phone that the carriers have blocked.
__label__1 You can't flag tethering because it's only data transfer, providers can not tell if it's your device or a tethered device using that data, and really it makes no difference anyway. Tether ho!
__label__1 This works perfect on my wife's Droid Charge. My Galaxy Nexus is another story. The description must not apply on Android 4 phones. When I follow instructions about applying the widget my phone just doesn't work that way. The widget just isn't in the wid
__label__0 I used it once and I didn't like it so uninstalled from my android.... That's all I have to say about that....
__label__1 Excellent selection of words and the graphics are fun and interesting.  There is however, one caveat when using this game.  If your batteries are running low this game WILL begin to lock up and the lock ups get worse as the battery gets lower.  Make sure
__label__1 Enjoy playing word search very much.  Keeps your mind busy and sharp!  Glad I ordered this game. Thank you very much
__label__1 Love word searches. This if a fun word app. You'll love it. Take a chance on it and get it. Its free!
__label__1 I like the little graphics used on the puzzles, they . Make the game more fun to play.The sound effects are cool too.
__label__1 I love the new update,  I have had this word search forover a year &amp; I was very excited to see the new puzzles.The graphics are beautiful &amp; I enjoy the puzzles. They'regood for a quick few minutes of fun when your on thego or at the doctors offic
__label__1 Ok, it is a really simple puzzle, one to help pass time and spark the vision a bit. This app does a great job of making it more of a challenge. Beautiful backgrounds that also set the puzzle at an angle so you don't feel quared off. The highlights on eac
__label__1 I play this game often and always enjoy it.  You can make it very easy or very challenging.  I am sort of an intermediate player
__label__0 Puzzles are redundant and boring. My five-year-old enjoyed this more than I did. Needs work before I download again. Not recommended by me!
__label__1 This game looks great and plays great.  I like how the words are grouped into themes and I love all the different background and selection designs. Also, nicely easy to select letters.
__label__1 Not sure why I has to buy 2 games to get all the content found in a single game on other platforms.  That's said - this level pack contains the 3 beat and most difficult levels from the psp minis 'the impossible game".The game itself is simple.  Tap on t
__label__1 This game is so awsome, i just love it so much, i play all the time, and this level pack rocks so much, especially the third level envy, so fun and so hard, it rocks...
__label__1 fun, fun, fun, fun, fun, fun, fun........ my kid loves to play this game for hours and hours. oh boy.

__label__1 By far, Forces of War is a great app. It's addicting. You can interact with players from around the world in this war game.However, sometimes when you log on, it will show a different person's profile. To fix this, you can simply turn off your device com
__label__1 I love this game the first week I had it I was like eh but I played it and its one of the best apps you can get for the devise that you have if you think its gonna be like COD then your wrong but still really great
__label__1 this game is amazing and its way better than the damn furry ball that talks Ps don't get that game....anywase this game is good
__label__0 This app only exists to get you to make in game purchases. Somewhat useful if you are looking to increase knowledge of military equipment, but the battles just say if you won or not, there is no player involvement other than just deciding to fight and bu
__label__1 Great game.excellent game play.good if you have strategic mind. SO WHAT I JUST SAID SIMPLIFIED : GET IT!!!! If you do get it feel free to add me code XAQKS
__label__0 I know that this game is free but if this company expects people to invest time in playing it then it would be nice if it worked. I know of another game that is free too. Its called tic tac toe and you'd be better off and less frustrated playing that.
__label__1 This is by far the best war game ever! I have played it nonstop just because I want to level up
__label__1 Can go on missions or bounty hunt. Create alliances, buy weapons, build bases to create income. Nice game. Give it a try. My ally code is ezuna..add me.
__label__1 This has quietly become one of my favorite apps. Awesome game of strategy. Build an elite squad of soilders over time. Train them and purchase weapons for battle. Earn money each time to fund your private army. Very cool game.
__label__1 Forces of war is a great game. You can add allies, battle online, and complete missions.My ally code is dzrnt please add me.
__label__1 I love this game and I got it free. don't expect to get into the action and be a hero. you are a general trying to gain new weapons and gain your money quickly. you can be allies with other players, collect bounties, and complete missions.
__label__1 I love this game! uken is very responding and has handled all the problems I have had with ease! It is so awesome! and its for free! the only problem is that it lags really bad on the fire. but still an awesome app! get it!!!!!!
__label__1 It takes a bit of time to understand all the options, but once you do the game really opens up and is thoroughly enjoyable. Be sure to form alliances early on. This is a big help during the battles. Alliance codes are found in the forum (in the game) .

__label__1 This game really changes your view on war. From clan wars to the simple mission this game is amazing. Befriend allies and battle your way to the top. This game has changed my life.
__label__1 this game is awesome I love it it is not as bad as everyone says it is. it never reset my profile.
__label__0 It doesn't work well for kindle... probably because kindle is not meant to play games or I do not how to make it work
__label__0 hate it hate it hate it u don't do poop u don't see your base u don't see the fights pecae out
__label__1 I literally can't stop playing. The clans are the best part. Second best are the tournaments, need the income. Don't change anything!!!! My ally code is phplv.

__label__0 When I got it I thought it was cool but when I did a mission it was just a click. Not good
__label__1 This game is great you can do missions battle actual people in the world and best of all get a boat load of money if you work hard at it download this app and add me as your ally My code:VWZHU
__label__1 This is a great strategy game.  Good for thinkers. No real action to see on the screen, purely RPG style.  Game is done in real time so you can't beat it in 2 hours like some.  If you like these types of games, this is one of the best.
__label__0 I HATED this game. Worst war game right next to eagles nest. So if you want this I bet you $5 that you'll HATE it too. I mean it. LISTEN TO ME. YOU WILL HATE IT.
__label__1 I wish it were not so addictive i find myself thinking about it at work. last thing i do before going to bed, first thing i do when i get up.
__label__1 I have to say that this game has turned out to be fantastic. Lots of play, lots of completion and multiple levels of action. Highly recommended.

__label__1 I love this game. I don't get why people hate it so much. You have to pick your stradegy of survival in war, make income to avoid negative cash flow, and of course, level up.... And it's FREE!  Best game for the kindlefire. And hint: I would prefer spend
__label__1 At first the game is confusing but once you figure out what you're doing it's really fun and a great pass time. I love it.Its free. Get it!
__label__1 This game is a highly addicting click-based game. You click a button and a number goes up, but you have to think every move through or else you will be dead relatively quick. The strategy mixed with the social aspect in that you can play together with fr
__label__0 okay im going to say this- i love strategy but this pathetic game in NOT STRATEGY there is no acual battle. Get colony attack u win by how powerful you are not a random coputer. theres no battle scene just get blitz braged its much better but thats a fps
__label__0 this game is exactly like EVERY OTHER game Urken games has released Urken make something NEW!!! and this game is the glitchy game they have made plus it makes it really easy for other people to hack your account
__label__1 it is very good. its a realalistic battle simulation game like deadliest warrior but not as good still awesome though
__label__1 this game is awesome because u can upgrade missions battle other people and build weapons its fun as well get it right now
__label__1 great game takes a little bit to get used to though ag first is complicated but if you learn how to do battles and things works great. however if your looking for a game you actually play this is not it.
__label__1 this game is the best game on my fire love it.code,inpnnI'm a lvl25 and I am increddibly sting for my Lvov and I'm a billionare
__label__0 if you've played one, you've played them all. This isn't exactly a game ... it is more like a boring pointless waste of time. I'm a huge RPG fan and think that calling this game an RPG is ridiculouy inappropriate.
__label__1 please look and other 1 star givers are stupid b b b b b b b b b b b b b
__label__0 it's not a real strategy game. all you do is push buttons and there is no battle scene or anything that really tells you why you won or lost a battle. also, since there is an element of luck in each &quot;battle,&quot; you could have far better weapons t
__label__1 Great app.  Works great on my kindle fire. no problems .love it.Great to be a free app. I would recommend this app. very fun
__label__1 This game is great.  I like the strategy side in it mixed with the war side. It gives you a sense of accomplishment when you win.
__label__1 this is a great war game if you hate to see blood and guts. even if your fine with blood and guts its still a great game.
__label__1 Usually I loose my interest on a game fast. with this game it didn't happen. It is so addicting. Every day I play it. If you don't get it than you are missing out.
__label__0 I got this game for me and my brother to try, but when we started we were so confused! Its way too complicated!!! PLUS......... you don't really even fight-we thought this would be like modern warfare, but its not even close! If you're looking for a fun 
__label__0 I got this for my husband and he did not like it. so I took it off my kindle.  sorry I got it.

__label__1 I had been avoiding using the cloud because I thought there was a monthly charge for it.  But then, while searching for something else I found the cloud gives you 5 gigs of storage free.  It only works for mp3s--that's what I have--and I can put music fr
__label__1 Like this product give me storage for my music and more I just love the extra storage and would use again

__label__1 This is quite a good app. For those of us not so great with money, it's a godsend. Intuitive and nice looking interface + ease of use makes this an app worthy of getting. Worth more than the $2 price tag. Get it, it's free today and very worth it if you

__label__1 This app was exactly what I was looking for. It's really easy to use. It dosn't connect with any banks or accounts so there is no worries about losing money and it has password protection for added security. By utilizing this app there is no need for me 
__label__1 Works very well.  Easy to set up.  Easy to customize.  Visually very appealing.  Nice, LARGE text on my Kyros 7024.  Runs flawlessly.  Worth the money.

__label__0 Way too much trouble to setup.  A lot of the problem is the lack of using a real keyboard.  I created and use a spreadsheet on my desktop and it's a lot easier and faster to use than an app on a tablet.  If a tablet or other android device is all you hav
__label__0 UPDATE ON WHY I DOWNGRADED TO ONE STAR::  The EXPORT CSV FILE feature creates a spreadsheet with the following format for the DATE COLUMN:  "Fri Sep 02 20:21:42 EDT 2011".  Can the developer change this to a NORMAL format that accounting programs recogni
__label__1 I bought this from Market the first time I used it. The export and backup are great if you plan to use other software, which I do. Doesn't budget, and neither do I so it's perfect for me. Try it! Great easy way to keep track of Totals...
__label__1 This is Great!  I'm still using a paper Checkbook, but I use this to keep a backup, and so that I can check (When I'm out) what I have in the bank, because I don't carry my checkbook around with me. I Love this App! I Recommend it to Everyone! Works Grea
__label__1 App does exactly what it says... it is a manual register. Password protection works fine. No issues running on Droid 2 Global.
__label__1 Easy to use. One of the best apps ever. Give it a try you won't be disappointed. I use instead if check register.
__label__1 I've been using this app for quite a while and couldn't be happier with it. Pretty much the same as a checkbook ledger but easier to keep track of, and it does the math for you so it's super reliable.
__label__1 If you have multiple bank accounts more then 2 I would recomend buying this app. It really is alot easier then carrying multiple bank ledgers. This app gives me one less thing I have to carry around.
__label__1 I don't know how some of these people came to the conclusions they did on some of these reviews. Most of the complaints are inaccurate (unless the app was updated and changed the features). You can add exact cents and new categories and you can edit entr
__label__1 Nice, simple and effective program. Much better than the old hand-written ledgers as this one doesn't make math errors. Can track multiple accounts too. Recommended.
__label__1 This app does everything we wanted it to do.you can reconcile with the bank statement by during the hidden entry option when cleared.
__label__0 this app did not do  what I thought it would be doing.. I decided to delete it from my tablet.
__label__1 Good ledger, a digital version that replaces the paper version you have in most checkbooks. Works great if you use it right
__label__1 I purchased this app about 1 year ago for my DROIDX.  It works great and I love it. I use a debit card and can quickly post my purchases. The free version only allows 2 accounts. Got the paid version so I could also keep up with my home based business. T
__label__1 I have searched high & low for a ledger app, & even called Amazon to see if they could recommend something.  They never mentioned this app.  I came across it by accident, downloaded it, & am 100% satisfied with it.
__label__1 Just what I was looking for. It's a great app and very easy to use and understand. Works good for me and the things I use it for.
__label__1 For someone who likes to have half his money in cash for budgeting purposes this app is great.  As I don't update my finances to the penny daily I can now more easily keep track of how the cash is spent and budget as needed when I do eventually sit down.
__label__1 I only opened it to test it. Looks simple enough to use. Password feature worked for me... Someone said it didn't. I don't write enough checks or track my transactions close enough to use this but if I did this application looks like something I would us
__label__1 First of all, this DOES NOT link to your bank info!  It is NOT AN ONLINE BANKING APP. It is an electronic register - period. It DOES NOT think for you - it only does MATH and remind you of auto-transactions!I've been using the Free version for over 6-mon
__label__1 I use this app every day. Keeps multiple accounts, and lets you name them. Gives you an expense report based on the categories you have chosen. Allows you to be very organized with your spending, without giving out a bit of your personal banking informat
__label__1 If there was anything I would want added to this app, it would be the ability to reconcile your account. Other than that I really like this one.
__label__1 I felt the need to run this app since I saw an earlier review saying the password did not work.  It DOES work and I was unable to access my info.unless I had the password. It does need to be at least 4 digits long though.Also, I was a little unsure how s
__label__1 I have been looking for a way to keep track of my debit card purchases.  I had bought a  My Vanilla Visa debit card.  It was great but I couldn't track my spending unless I kept checking online.  So this is so convenient, I now can automatically see my b
__label__1 This app is very user friendly and I love that it calculates every transaction for you and lets you go back and mark when something is cleared.
__label__1 Works well. I have never written a check and don't plan on it. Good way to keep track of what i am spending money on and how much i have left on my debit card.
__label__1 I've used it for a week, so far it's great. It's easy to use and you can add multiple accounts.
__label__1 nothing too exceptional, but then again, I'm not expecting something exceptional, I just want something that works. And it seems to work so far on a xoom. to everyone complaining about putting your acct number: don't use a real one in the app and problem
__label__1 this is a very handy app to have. I am so glad that I have it. It is save me so much time and worry concerning my finances. I love the convenience of the app. It is very easy to use.
__label__1 I use You Tube quite often so to have access to this on my tablet is great. Don't have to get on another system to get on.
__label__1 This is s great app I love it because you don't have to wait for it to load you just have it right there.bye this app if you love music.

__label__1 Family seems to enjoy it.  No problems and it downloaded very quickly.  No issues, except I hate writing reviews on downloaded apps.

__label__1 download full vids. off youtube and can be seen full screen must get this app for kindle fire or any device
__label__1 Its great and i didnt get any virus or whatever its fun to get free movies and music from youtube. i suggest this.
__label__1 People who want to download any type of video no matter if it's music or tv shows, then this app is for you. I've downloaded lots of videos since I've used this app. The best part is that you don't need WiFi, 3g, or even 4g to access your downloaded vide

__label__0 doesn'T play youtube playlists, takes forever to start and won't play playlists and search engine sucks !!!! if I could rate properly = minus 5 stars.Basically not a single youtube app actually works, and the few that do allow me to log in to my account 
__label__1 Get all the free songs u want from this app from all ur fav  artist cool helpful but requires internet to get music
__label__0 DON'T GET THIS APP!!! It may seem cool at first to download music from the web, but don't be fooled. After having the app for a week my kindle started actin weird. I wasn't able to fast forward my music and my Kindle wouldn't turn on when I charged it. I
__label__1 It allows me to download my favorite youtube videos and when I turn off my internet or can't get a signal I can still  watch my downloaded videos.
__label__1 I have had absolutely no issuses with this app. It works completely perfect. I use this on my kindle fire and have had it not work at the maximum of 2 times.
__label__0 not for phones no no no no no no no no no phone no gooood a b c d e
__label__1 Whenever I like a new song or want one of my favorite videos from youtube on my Kindle Fire, I can just easily download it straight from this app. It only takes about a few seconds and its so EASY. You must be crazy not to have this app :)
__label__0 this app is youtube right? well it only gives you 40 videos that you wouldn't even want to watch. if you like wasting your time then go ahead and buy this useless app
__label__0 The only app I've ever downloaded that was flagged malicious. Immediately uninstalled. Even if it's not, it's an issue with the app that's causing it to be flagged.
__label__1 FREEdi YouTube Downloader is great.I used it to just listen to music at school,but it works everywhere.Its downloading is quick and the music works great.Get this app!!!
__label__1 use this app to download mp3 and mp4 files straight to your kindlefire. it works amazingly. don't listen to the stupid people who give it a bad rating because they don't know how to use this app. search for music using the magnifying glass on the bottom 
__label__1 At first I didn't think it would have the music and it wouldn't let me download but this app has proved me wrong. I really enjoy this app.
__label__1 awesome awesome awesome awesome awesome! I love utube it is awesome and screw everyone who dislikes this app. awesome awesome awesome!
__label__1 I never really know if these MP3 download apps are legal or not, but I guess it must be. Haven't done a lot of searching but found the songs I wanted. Had no problem downloading song and playing it back on my tablet.
__label__0 I was downloading stuff and then it stiled working. the pro is to much money. Downloders beware!!!! the last thing you want is to only downlode15 videos.
__label__1 One can pick anything they want on You Tube an it is great. I listen to whomever - even religious stuff they allow on here.
__label__0 This app has a virus on it so it won't let me download any songs video or music I'm mad because it's the only app that did work and now it sucks
__label__0 this app is good at first but then when you try just to watch normal youtube it redirects you to the app and tries to force you to download the video on their app. also it stores the videos not on the app but in your pictures. another thing it also frequ
__label__1 This is actually a really good application if you have great wifi. All you need is patience! Give it some time, and you'll really love it! Get this app if you like viral videos! I love it and you will too!
__label__1 this works perfectly on the kindle fire and makes it so easy to download youtube videos in either video or mp3 music only format
__label__0 Was working fine now can't download nothing no videos no mp3's. Please fix  as soon as possible, was my favorite app.
__label__1 I already downloaded a couple if songs to mp3 and it was simple! The realplayer of android apps except its only for youtube. Try using Astro file manager to search for the folder and find the videos and songs you downloaded and converted. Very much worth
__label__0 Search and you'll find....however it fails to actually play a video. And if a video somehow manages to play, it suddenly stops and the app just dies.  Uninstalled after multiple letdowns.
__label__1 This app is great. Download videos and I can show them to my friends without having to find them again. I love it. I have put it on every Droid I have owned.
__label__1 I really Love the free You Tube downloader. I easily find older music that I liked when I was younger and can enjoy it again via You Tube.
__label__1 This app is by far the best. Its very simple to use on my device.MicroMacro Mobile Inc. is probably a non-popular company, but it does make a great and simple to use app, with very high video quality.Recommend this app highly, good for all ages.
__label__1 This app is awesome but you have to press = button to check downloads,DO EVERYTHIG ELSE PURCHASE THIS APP NOW!!!!!!
__label__1 I like this because it downloaded all my favorite vocaloid songs and hetalia videos so &quot;GET IT NOW OR YOU'LL DIE&quot;
__label__1 I guess there are some people who don't know how to us the app but it is very self explanitory, to search for videos hit you're menu button, to download keep you're finger on the video then a menu will pop up,  it works wonders
__label__0 it caused a virus on my kindle fire for days I couldn't open my apps or app store it finally opened bac up and I got virus protection and antivirus scan
__label__0 I downloaded it on my kindle fire.... it doesn't play any videos. Very disappointed and I deleted it off my kindle.
__label__0 it keeps force closing on my kindle fire it doesn't always play the vids and everytime ive opened it it closes
__label__1 We all love having Youtube at the palm of our hands.  Lots to check out and search for, haven't had any issues.
__label__1 This is by far my favorite app on my kindle fire (even better than all my games!)  because I can watch all my favorite videos from Youtube even when I don't have Wi-Fi!! Brilliant! I was especially happy I got the app when a channel I liked got deleted f
__label__1 This little youtube downloader works great with kindle fire.  I can use the search function and type in any video makers name and view their videos.  I tried it with my own youtube account, simply typing in my name I use to make videos.  Instantly I foun
__label__1 The rating system needs to include more stars for this product. I would rate it a 10+. It's easy to use. The App is fast and easy. The downloads were really fast.
__label__1 because i don't like spending money on music i can just download it for free.i get great sound quality and can play on my apps while i listen to what i want btw better than pandora
__label__1 This is the easy access to you tube.  Every other day or two I check you tube to see if there is anything interesting.  Having this app makes it convenient for me.
__label__1 It is my favotite for when im in the car or something and have no internet connection, because you can download music and videos FREE! On my kindle fire, you hold down on the video of your choice, download as mp3, and you get the adio and it goes straigh
__label__1 I love this app. I use it to download music and it works amazingly. it downloads the songs extremely quickly.
__label__1 I love this app so much because I can watch videos without wick once I download them and the app works perfect!
__label__1 Until now,all the good songs in the Kindle Fire music store are paid.Now I can download my favorote songs as.MP3!I'm listening to one of those right now--The One That Got Away.And they're free!I can also download my favorote Cimorelli songs as MP3 so I c
__label__0 This app is just a mess an doesnt work all the time. I recamend the Droid Youtube Downloader (the title of the app)
__label__0 Wtf is going on with this? I cant download anything anymore! When I try to &quot;download as MP3&quot; It says &quot;Searching&quot; and then a half second later it stops! I even deleted a song I had already downloaded from this app, and tried to re-dowl
__label__0 this app was good and I liked it but then it stoped working and would then add in my gallery dumb pictures and adds. when I first got it it didn't do that. so don't download
__label__1 Download all of any youtube videos! I can get music videos, funny clips, or even educational tutorials! This is great for all ages allowed on the site, because this is all of the website.
__label__1 Get this! I got this and there's no viruses. I just easily download a video and it goes on my camera! Amazing
__label__0 OMG this app totally sucks. You have to click and dL and view and then it freezes. Why even bother offering an app that has so many glitches.
__label__1 I FEEL THAT THIS APP IS VERY GOOD!!! IT LETS U DOWNLOAD MANY MANY VIDEOS!!! U CAN SEARCH VERY MANY DIFFERENT VIDEOS!! THE ONLY COMPLANT IS THAT SOMETIMES WHEN I GO TO SEARCH IT SAYS &quot;NOT RESPONDING FORCE CLOSE&quot; THEN U GET OUT OF IT AND GET BACK
__label__1 this is a great app. its a good way to get music and videos. I will use this app till my kindle dies
__label__1 I love having my favorite YouTube videos at my disposal and its very convenient in downloading my favorite songs. Word.
__label__1 I luv this app soooo much!!! u can get videos and music for free!!! idk what is wrong with ppl who dislike it!!!! those ppl r stupid!
__label__1 This is a great little app for the Android Velocity Cruz T301 Tablet, because you can watch the videos online, or download them to the SD card and watch them later. :)
__label__1 I'm sorry but if you can't figure out how to use this app then you should not own a smart phone.when you load the app it generates videos that are popular. they may be songs, commercials, game clips....if you want to search for a song or video, click on 
__label__1 Love this app! on my kindle fire I download all my favorite YouTube videos, and they are saved to my gallery. you can watch them wherever, wifi or not. I absolutely love this app, I'm into a bunch of youtubers. ^_^ Thanks for making it!!
__label__0 DON'T BUY THIS IS A VIRUS I BEG U NEVER EVER BUY THIS APP EVER NEVER EVER OK PEOPLE IF U DPNT BELEIVE ME THEN LET IT RUN ON A VIRUS OK
__label__0 this app is horrible! doesnt work messed up my kindle fire, always makes it shut down. DONT DOWNLOAD!!!!!!! waste of your time
__label__0 I would like this app, but there is one problem.This app does not tell you how to download the videos!!!!!Other than that, it also acts like a virus.
__label__1 this is great on my kindle fire greatest app ever!!!! I don't see what the big fuss was at all this is working wonders
__label__1 Before I had this app, I was stuck using tubemate which isn't able to download videos anymore. I was furious when I heard this. When I discovered this app, I thought it would be a waste of space by the looks of the reviews, but I tried it anyway. It turn
__label__1 This is my fab app, no doubt. It works perfectly on my Kindle Fire. I have been downloading videos constantly since I installed it. I am a quilter, and there are so many amazing tutorials on youtube. But on a crowded sewing table there isn't always room 
__label__1 I love this app. There is one flaw however. It doesn't show VEVO videos. Other than that this is a great app.
__label__0 keeps force closing and keeps having errors. Don't get for kindle fire. It is great until you keep playing it.
__label__1 this app lets you download songs and videos if you don't get this app your so stupid and if you don't get this app you'll be sorry
__label__0 It shows about a dozen garbage videos to choose from, none of which I had any interest in whatsoever. There is no way to search for anything, nothing like on a computer. What you see is what you get and that is all, a lousy dozen pieces of foolish infant
__label__0 its a virus I have a anti virus app and ir reported that this app was malicious I recommend not getting this
__label__0 My Kindle Fire HD identified You Tube Down loader as malicious and advised me to uninstall it. So, I did. Avoid at all costs.
__label__1 I tried about 5 other apps like this, and they were all very cumbersome. This app is exactly what I was looking for! The videos are easy to download, easy to find after they are downloaded, and the interface is extremely intuitive. I love this!! I am usi
__label__0 Is it the app or is it youtube? I don't know. What I do know is I'm tired of. the inconsistency . All I'm looking for is a way to reliably view and download youtube videos. This ain't it.
__label__0 was good until the last update now i cant download a single thing it sucks they need to fix it and soon.
__label__0 Ever since the latest update, this app will not let me listen to any of the songs that I had on it. It used to work fine and it was truly an amazing app... until suddenly it stopped working when it got a new  update. Now whenever I try to play a song I h
__label__1 like watching funny flicks. help to take the stress away from some miserable days. Always good to have a laugh.
__label__0 save your self the trouble .............you cant pick what you want to watch only the most popular or recent don't get
__label__1 This is one of the best apps! It gives you free music and YouTube! Who wouldn't buy it? I love it!
__label__0 this game is the suckys game I have ever played!!! who the hell made this damn game? you suck bigtime!!!!!
__label__1 This is one of the best apps I've downloaded.  It's extremely easy to use.  It gives you the choice of watching or downloading a video and the choice of different resolutions.  It's opened a whole new can of worms ... even more time spent on my kindle fi
__label__0 No nothing other than a choice between video or mp3, then 1 million.Ute of downloading, then nothing for 5 minutes.  Not worth the free price should have been paid for my time.
__label__0 it worked great until recently.  now like others have said it won't download bringing up an error notice about speed whig is bogus I can tootle outbreak and play anything I want.this has been reported yet nothing being disappointed in amazon for not corr
__label__0 Doesn't do what it says. Does absolutely nothing but waste your time. Crap. Crap. Crap. Crap. Crap. Uninstalled. -Droid Bionic
__label__0 this is not needed for my kindle fire and i wasted my time and anything and everything else that i spent to get this.
__label__1 ok the great things is everything, except wen the downside comes into play...everything stops loading...EVERYTHING.. and to get it working again i have to reinstall the app
__label__0 I have a app, and when you buy apps, it tells you if they are clean. When its not clean, it tells you what it could do to your device. Turns out it could shut down your device forever. Don't buy!
__label__1 Taking youtube everywhere with my kindle is great.  Love storing my favorite videos right on my kindle!  I would tell my friends about it.
__label__1 Love this app! Now able to watch utube videos on my kindle. Also very easy to download them to the kindle for later viewing. Has a handy search feature to find any video. Have had it for several weeks and no issues so far.
__label__1 Great app if you want to watch or download videos to your phone or tablet.  Great for downloading videos ahead of time and watching them later or when no internet is available.  Fast and easy to use.  Definitely worth having if you are a big fan of You T
__label__0 This did not download or install at all on my cruz tablet..I used to have youtube already on it but it disappeared so I tried to load this and it didn't work at all
__label__1 the program does exactly what it says.  easy to learn and start using. has some limits and doesn't work on every video but so far it has worked just fine..
__label__0 okay this is what it says...error while retrieving your app please try again.  I'm sick of it. (I usually don't make bad reviews.  if I make a bad review, there is a reason.)
__label__1 It has been so nice to be able to quickly view multiple You Tube videos on my Kindle Fire.  Being able to see the You Tube offerings on my Kindle Fire and brought a new impressions of how You Tube has changed our expectations and lives.
__label__0 This is the worse YouTube app every made, you can't sign into your profile and it's badly made and hard to figure out. It looks like the didn't even try to develop this app. It honestly doesn't deserve a star.
__label__1 I loved this app, it was pretty much the most commonly used app on my Kindle Fire, but for some reason I can't find it anymore so.. I'm disappointed in that.
__label__1 I really enjoy this app at home. I can download any video from youtube I want. I have like 35 music videos and 19 episodes of Fullmetal Alchemist.
__label__1 ads this ads that i've never seen an ad from this app when its not running its a good app but sometimes it looks like it will play a video  and it goes back to the page I was at
__label__1 Wow, I just realized I never changed my review back to five stars. My bad. This app is awesome. It does everything it says it does. I haven't tried any other apps of this sort, because I like this one so much.
__label__0 this program was. running relatively well but now aneroid antibirus is reporting it as malware.  This needs to be checked out. It may explain some random restarts I've been getting lately.
__label__0 I was looking at some of the other youtube downloading apps on Amazon and several of them started having the same failed download problem as FREEdi within the last day or so. I really have loved the ability to download videos to watch on my TV (I stream 
__label__1 This ap is one of my favorites. You can download YouTube music to your tablet for free....how cool is that!!???
__label__1 Many people said a &quot;virus&quot; made it suck but I love it. There is no virus, at least for me. I use this app when I need to watch youtube vids. One day my kindle stopped allowing me to watch videos on it so I started to watch them on this app. I c
__label__1 Love this app, so much easier than the official website. Use it all the time. You tube is awesome. Even on my t.v.
__label__1 Free way to take youtube on the goDownload anything on youtube and you can download as mp3 to listen to music while out of app
__label__1 This one works.  Tried the other free one. It didn't work. This one worked just fine. I'm satisfied. Try it!
__label__1 I absolutely love you tube, I look for all kinds of videos on there. Usually some funny ones, I'm usually laughing insanely.
__label__1 I just downloaded this app and I LOVE it. This is honestly the best app ever! I've always wanted a way to watch my favorite anime on the go, but with this, I can have any video on YouTUBE that I want in about 45 seconds. I only have 2 more words about th
__label__1 YouTube offers so much to so many. It is definitely a worthwhile site to visit as often as you like.
__label__1 It took a while for me to figure out how to use it but now that I know I love it. Nice clear picture and good sound.
__label__0 It would be a cool app if it would WORK!  I have tried to download a video 100 times already but it wont work. DONT get it. It may be free but it aint worth the price. SO DI NOT GET IT!
__label__1 Instead of downloading videos through your laptop, why not use this app. Great download speeds. I use it all the time. Instead of watching them load on your browser or stream it with youtube, why not do a one-time download instead?? You can replay it aga
__label__0 I wanted to watch Ain't nobody got time for that but I couldn't search for it or anything.I don't care that it's free.I honestly hate it.Listen to the other guy and don't bother even downloading it. Never mind the one that cost money.
__label__1 I love it, but you have to have  patience. Because when you go to search it, it will close. Just reenter, and it will be fine
__label__0 How do I view my videos when there downloaded. If I can figure this out. I would be happy to rate this app.
__label__0 worst apps that I have download. Good think that I removed it from my kindle.I was not happy with this product
__label__0 Save yourself the trouble this crappy app does not work at all. I tried to download a movie and it wouldn't work and then when I tried to download a small clip it didn't work. It sucks really.

__label__1 easy to use, fast, HQ, and works with kindle fire! love it! keep apps like these coming please please please!
__label__1 this app is great! I really enjoy it. I mean like you can download videos and songs and stuff off of this app for free! its better than wasting your money buying music and videos off of your kindle app store...
__label__1 YouTube is very helpful and I'm glad that I have this app. I always come back and use this tool
__label__1 i have a kindle fire and ths app is amazing, nvr been so happy b4. thank u God 4 it
__label__1 A fast and easy way to save your favorite Youtube videos for on the go use and entertainment, it is a must have app for youtube users who like to always be ready to share the latest music video with friends, or even that new viral video that just started
__label__0 I thought this app would be good for roadtrips that you have no wifi on and you could save your videos to your kindle fire. well you can't. and that's why I  give it 1 star. its good for something if you don't have an Internet option, but most of us do. 
__label__1 What can I say - this does what it is supposed to do - no problems with it. I would recommend it for people who use You Tube on their Kindle - it makes it easier to view videos.
__label__0 Another garbage app not worth your time.You want youtube, go to youtube.Oh, snap!  Forgot, you can't &#34;do&#34; youtube......flash drive no workie on Kindle.
__label__0 I thought I would like this program.  But after doing a virus scan on my phone, this is the only program that came up as MALIOUS.....  Use caution when downloading.....  Send email to Amazon asking if they scan or review apps before posting for us to dow
__label__0 don't get this app I recommend music download and/or video downloader if u want this type of app 4 videos.PS- I have both...they're amazing
__label__1 I love going on and downloading music and it can go right to your device or cloud and then I don't have tto buy my music love it use it everyday !!!
__label__1 Works wonderfully! One of the best things one could have. kindle fire + this app = awesome. I definitely recommend this app
__label__0 Giving this only one star because I am not a You Tube fan.  To many times they contain viruses which I have had my fair share of problems with.  It is not worth putting You Tube on a good computer.
__label__1 one of the best apps I have ..if you have a tablet this app is a must have I highly recommend this
__label__1 it lets me download videos and mp3 songs from youtube. you can search for it on youtube or search for whatever you want on the app.
__label__1 I've been using this app for a while with no problems at all. I download whole videos or rip them as mp3's to turn into ringtones. I love this app and it keeps me from buying ringtones. Sometimes i use it in place of the YouTube app to view videos as wel
__label__1 this app does exactly what it says, have never had a force close. 5 stars. from sidekick 4g with android 2.2
__label__1 You can use this to view videos and download them as videos or as music. I love It and there is no better app of its kind. Get this app. You wont regret it.
__label__1 This is the perfect App for watching how to do things.  Two years ago I began teaching myself to draw.  When I found the YouTube app, I began to watch all types of artists who are the best in the world teach me how better to draw.  I quickly graduated fr
__label__0 I like the app but this isn't right it is illegal to download music off youtube. that's why I give it only 1 star.
__label__1 I can find my favority &#34;how to&#34; video's on You Tube and download them on my Kindle so I can view them at my leasure, how cool is that?
__label__1 I wish I would have been had an app like this. let's you search and download any video or mp3 off YouTube.
__label__1 it works great all you have to do is go to youtube, type in what you want, tap di youtube downloaded, and your song will be ready in around 2 minutes!
__label__0 This ap began okay but then just stopped working. The Pro version isn't any better. Many videos stop downloading at around 92 or so percent, which is aggravating. Now, for some reason, I no longer even have the option of downloading!This ap used to work.
__label__1 this the best music/downloading spoon the market, heck I wish I could get this on my computer so I could download music or videos on my computer &quot;
__label__1 I love YouTube and use it a lot.  I use it to learn how to do knitting stitches I don't know and watch funny animal videos and on You Tube you can find anything you want to look at or learn.
__label__1 It works amazing on my kindle!! i haven't bought a single song!! I just download the song as an mp3 and that's where I get all my music!
__label__1 I love it. I should've downloaded this earlier l. I can listen to songs and download them without having to pay. This time I can download a song on my mp3 for free instead of paying on the music shop.
__label__1 this is the best app ever!!! I Dp not know why people are saying it is a virusamazon would not let you download it
__label__0 I hate this app it's a waste of your time! Don't get it, because it can and probably will give you a virus.
__label__1 I am so greatful to see this working again!  It's so easy to use and has less happening in the background than youtube so you can hit your menu button to search whatever then long hold on top of what you chose and a box pops up.  Also you can save anythi
__label__1 It is a little slow but I love it - I download weaving tutorials, and it is nice to be able to stop and start when I need to.  I would have no hesitation in telling anyone to get it.
__label__0 what people are saying is true. It used to be a fantastic app but for some reason after the update, the screen keeps cutting the scenes and exits by it self. Please fix!
__label__1 You get to preview your song,movie,or little clips on it if you would like to.But instead plugging it on a computer you have  app instead.
__label__1 Works great, no problems with usage. You want to get entertained, learn something new, get grossed out,fill your quota on everything cute, this is a one stop place for that. I learned to braid my hair, lance a boil,make a gusseted pillow, and many other 
__label__1 I thought it was great and easy to use on the kindle fire it is easy and I can download anything I want'!!!!
__label__0 Did not like this.  I immediately deleated it and dowloaded the Droid Youtube Downloader.  This did not suit my needs.
__label__0 It's kinda funny but if you look at all these 5 star positive reviews to this program, all the reviews  sound identical and they're all written the same. the damn developer is reviewing his own application! this is pathetic. just download tubemate.
__label__1 Love it very much, very functional and user-friendly and is free. Can download songs in mp3 or in video, Thank you so much.
__label__1 I Love This App. It Has Great Features An You Can Even Download Free Music. Great To Use, Great On The Go, And Just Another Great Application.
__label__1 it is great but it still needs updates or else  it wont download thingsFREEdi YouTube Downloaderlovely  blah blah blah blah blah blah blah
__label__0 Long story short its got a virus. it messed up my kindle fire so I have reset the whole thing.
__label__1 This app really works well with tablets There is no pausing like there can be with most wireless objects. Truely great!
__label__1 I dont know about you guys but I didnt have an updateAlthough I cant watch movies and certain videos
__label__1 For all tablets that aren't supported by Google Play and as such can't download google apps such as YouTube, this is a great app. If you know what you want to see you just type it in, and can watch it, download it, or download and convert in an MP3. It's
__label__0 Viewed the product once and did not like it.  Was not what I expected. Not sure what I hoped for in this product.
__label__0 This was not what I thought it to be. Just regular you tube does me fine. Did not like the way it opened.
__label__1 This app is too awesome to be free and legal! Wow, free songs and videos when ever i want without wifi!Get this!

__label__1 its so awesome you can take on the go and watch them fastter when downloaded. this why its so awesome.
__label__1 I love this app. it works great on my kindle fire. it saves me a lot of money because youtube has a ton of songs so I can just download them for free instead of paying a dollar per song.
__label__1 this is great so I can down load music on to my kindle fire and listen any time I want
__label__1 I enjoy watching videos on this so with family and friends.  We gather round the Kindle and laugh.  I also use to view political clips.

__label__1 only one simple flaw... IT FORCE CLOSES TOO MUCH! but aside from... did I mention updating deletes all your data on the app? aside from that this app is perfect.
__label__1 Raising grandchildren rarely gives me the opportunity to watch much more than cartoons on television and I frequently need escape.  This is great for me as it provides me with everything from laughs to inspiration for science and backyard projects.  It i

__label__1 Works like a charm. No issues with HTC Thunderbolt. Glad to find this in the Amazon app store. Love it!
__label__1 Having the YouTube app on my kindle fire hd is convent and useful. You Tube is my &#34;go to&#34; when I need a video on how to do something from cooking to gardening.
__label__1 The app does exactly what it says. The interface is intuitive and it was able to download the videos I wanted in multiple format options including audio only.
__label__1 Got this to download some content for my mother in law that she wanted to watch all of the time. Worked well for agree product.
__label__0 don't get it all my music say playback error and it sucks a lot and when you download a song for the first time the album cover for that song is the album cover for every song
__label__0 I was looking for a convient way to downloas songs and free music so I came across this app and decided to try it and it worked for about a month with a ton of crashes and now your rip off app says when I try to play a video something like cannot play fi
__label__1 Have you ever wanted to throw your phone across the room because a youtube video wouldn't load?  Well, look no further.  This app lets you download youtube videos and keep them on your phone or Kindle to play when you are not in a Wifi zone or using 3G/4
__label__0 for a while this was great but then all the sudden the videos started gliching and freezing and skipping... which makes it terrible.  so now i cant watch the videos i want to on my kindle

__label__1 this is one of my fav apps funny story when I was about to press remove from carousal. but I then pressed remove from divice and pressed okay
__label__1 This app is amazing. When I have Internet I use this to download funny or entertaining videos so that when I'm bored and no Internet I have something to do. Works great on kindle fire.
__label__1 As soon as I got my Kindle, I looked all over the appstore for an app like Apple's &amp;#34;iTube&amp;#34; and downloaded about 11 different apps that claimed to download youtube videos to your Kindle (Rocketfish and junk like that) but I never even cons
__label__1 I don't need this app for myself. This app is so helpful to keep my daughter occupied when there is no WiFi available. I DL all of her favorite videos.
__label__0 Well first off it always freezes and make my kindle fire run slow. Also it made it to where I had to get a new kindle cause everytime I turned my kindle on it played the same song. I don't recommend this!
__label__0 this app i thought, was going to play youtube videos but i bought it and i picked videos to watch but all it did was put pics in my gallery of the video.
__label__1 I use this as a one click apps so that I will not be going to internet explorer at all times
__label__1 I've had this app since December, and it has worked perfectly the whole time. Never has it slowed down my Kindle Fire, nor interfered with my youTube access. I use it frequently, and have downloaded over 50 songs with this app. I would, and have, recconm
__label__1 Internet on Kindle Fire is very slow so I can rarely watch youtube videos because of the slowness, but when I got it, youtube is so fast!!!
__label__1 We love youtube and this is a great app. We are happy with our purchase and we use this all the time. Thank you!
__label__0 When you try downloading an mp3, it ends up being a 5 or 6 x loop of the full audio of the video, and is 5 or 6 x longer. The update did not fix this, and I am uninstalling it. Droid X.
__label__0 I couldn't find anything with this app. No search and you can't view the videos of people in a list like on youtube.com.
__label__1 If you YouTube, you need this app.  It works great and I never have a problem with it!  Thanks for an easy solution to YouTube'ing on the Kindle Fire!
__label__0 No features that are better than regular Youtube, thought this app was supposed to run faster on the Kindle Fire than the regular Youtube app.  Nope.
__label__1 i like the option to download as mp4 video or mp3 song or even acc.works great on my kindle fire.it comes in handy if i hear a song on tv or radio i like.i download and take my favorite music with me on the go.
__label__1 You Tube is a fun site but it also has excellent presentations on &#34;How To&#34;, medications and business. It works so well with the Kindle Fire and can be a great means of entertainment when you are stuck waiting for something.
__label__1 You saw it in the title. My favorite app I have. The best I ever will have. I use it all the time. Just phenominal. I highly recommend this app.
__label__1 I love this app, it lets you download any video from YouTube! Kindle Fire users: to get to the menu, pull that tab on the bottom of the screen to get the bar with the home icon on it. Press the box with the 3 lines in it. Enjoy :)
__label__1 Can be better, but it's the best they have so far, and it's is a Must Have for KF users since it's one &quot;I use allot!!!&quot;. You looking for all the &quot;must haves?&quot;... well thats all we review, so check my list out.. Know of a better one, o
__label__0 MicroMacro Mobile Inc. Is VERY LUCKY that this is free. I was so mad that I ALMOST ruined my kindle fire hd and almost had to change it back to factory settings and reset it all because of it. I was sooo close to doing that. ITS NOT WORTH IT FOR GOSH SAK
__label__1 the touch is great and its a sick app love it. got a lot of fun videos and haven't had any problems with. wish I new more videos
__label__1 You can watch videos that you save, even without wifi (need to save first)  I've also saved music as an mp3 and you have full songs for free! I would get this app no matter the other bad reviews. This has more benifits than thought.
__label__0 this was my favorite app of all time.but one day it just stiled working. I cant download any more songs.
__label__1 Wow, finally a program that does what it is supposed to do.  That is so rare that it caught me off guard.  Great interface, and works very well.  My only suggestion is that the print size be increased.  I am getting a little too old to read the very tiny
__label__1 I am in LLLLOOOVVVEEE with the band One Direction and everyday I watched their youtube videos. I tried to look for an app so I could follow them. Since the Kindle Fire doesn't give you wifi everywhere you go, I looked for videos I could download for free

__label__1 if you are tired of your videos buttering then get this app. it downloaded your video for you to watch anywhere.my tip is to use the gallery application if you yavve a kindle fire to view the videos.the app works perfectly
__label__1 This is a great app. if u knew how to use your kindle or phone u would know how to search for something.
__label__0 Does nothing but crash and other programs won't work without it so I downloaded for that reason only.  I have uninstalled and tried reinstall but it still crashes.
__label__1 This is an easy and essential way to get you tube content to you tablet the easy way.  It works fine, I'm not sure if you tube  would work at all if you didn't have this little app.
__label__0 Product did not function as indicated in the description.  I was unable to download any videos from the internet.  Unless there is some secret to making it work, it was beyond my ability to get it to do what I wanted it to do.
__label__0 Won't download!!!! WTF?! Seriously? Worked great when I first got it but now it sucks and won't download ANYTHING! Soooooo angry! Had a blast when I first had it but it is a total waste of time and effort. Complete and utter bullsh!t.
__label__1 This is a great app for kindle fire. I have only downloaded music and have no other plans for any videos. Thhis is a perfdct way to get free music. ALSO IF YOU WANT TO DOWNLOAD MUSIC DOWNLOAD MUSIC AS AN MP3 THE VIDEOS HAVE BETTER SOUND QUALIYY THAN THE

__label__1 So far I have downloaded 80 songs using this app. Paying for all the songs I want to listen to was just too exspensive. This app is easy to use and makes it easy to download other songs. I tried other downloading apps but they don't download it TO your d

__label__0 It is a virus I detected it on my own no youtube vidios would load my apps were very slow when it came to loading the apps.Then I got an anti-virus detecter it told me thus app was a virus so I uninstalled it. I never installed the app again.
__label__0 every time I try to look on the app it said errorr.the graphes are horrible.I mean serusiuly what the mess
__label__0 -This is the daughter of Justin, BTWAnytime I try to download a video, it says 'File Size not Available Yet'. I even cleared the app of all my music *HUUGE MISTAKE* tried redownloading videos I used to have, but they pull up the same error. What confuses
__label__1 I loveeee this app! You can download songs as mp3 files and take your favorite videos and download them! It very great for long car rides. Download this app! Sooooo glad it was free! I downloaded Tv episodes and music and watch them on car rides. Very go
__label__0 Works... But I just downloaded it for my kids to watch videos on it. But when I saw the videos on it. This is not a youtube this is an I want you to see my body boys app. Or girls look at all the stupid stuff I can do. Either way DO NOT DOWNLOAD! I forgo
__label__0 Very disappointed. I was unable to navigate through this app and I was unable to find what I wanted to watch.
__label__1 I don't know what all these negative reports come from but I download all the full length  movies and shows with ease.  Occasionally it closes down but it's because I have a ton of apps open at the same time. Get it and stop complaining...it's Free!
__label__0 ok so when I first got it it worked great but now it wont download anything its terrible if you don't listen idk
__label__0 I loved this app but I updated my kindle fire and now I can't download videos anymore.  what the heck happened?
__label__1 This app was a great app when I first got it, and I couldn't believe that it was free! Then, after using it almost daily, one day it stopped working properly. If I tried to play or download videos, it would bring up a message claiming a connection proble
__label__0 thought this would be killer for my kids - download vids to keep calm when I'm without wifi or 3g, but it didn't work at all...optimus s
__label__1 This app is so versatile. I download all my favorite songs through this using the &quot;audio only&quot; option and it automatically puts it all into my music on my KindleFire without me having to mess with Amazon Cloud Player or buy the songs either. I 
__label__1 everyone get this app u can watch anything on here btw every one plz watch computernerd101 if u get youtube
__label__0 this app takes longer the an hour to load. You cant get download a video. I tried to download a video and It. wouldn't download . I tried to download it a few days later it still didnt download.!!!!!!!!!!! ITS A FAIL!!!!!!!!!!
__label__0 This app was OK when I first got it but then after I watched a video, it forced closed by itself.  I tried uninstalling it from my kindle, but it still did the same thing!  I would advise kindle fire owners not to get this.
__label__1 This downloader didn't have the greatest reviews, but I haven't had any problems with it and I use it all the time to view videos and search for new musicians.
__label__1 good good goodnight good ggood good good good zbb e d d d d d ddudhhd bbshwj jwkchf hsh Hendrick hdbf sjhs
__label__1 This app is great. And its my favorite. Its fast and easy to download videos and mp3 onto your Kindle Fire. The best part is that once you have downloaded your songs/videos you can watch them without wifi. So you can bring it to school and watch videos a

__label__0 This app was a waste of my time and energy to download then uninstall on my Kindle.  No clue what it was for.
__label__1 you tube is so so so cool I can use it in so many different ways like school videos and videos just fun game time videos cool so so so so so so cool
__label__1 Specially for those trips you know you might get without WiFi Internet connection for a long period of time on your kindle, you just browse anything you want on youtube and download it to watch on those occasions. I love it.
__label__0 this app is.horrible and you cant.search for the video or music u want. -.  not worth it so don't waste your time withthe app
__label__1 My family travels a lot so when I bought the kindlefire in November, I was disappointed there was no free Tv shows or movies without wifi so I'm really happy now and it is AMAZING!! works well on kindlefire, besides if u don't like it u can just delete i
__label__1 Excellent APP. Just like my desktop. No issues. Fast downloading my favorite You Tube videos. Highly recommend to all sceptics....Thanks Amazon !!!!
__label__1 I looooove this app. It allows you to download music into your internal storage, so you don't have to buy it in the app store. As for slowing my kindle fire down, I haven't really noticed anything. Get this app! You'll be satisfied, I PROMISE!! Its a fre
__label__1 The app is great. You don't even need the Internet.........you can just see the video or download it. If you see it the one you downloaded then it has no BUFFINING one it. I reccmend this app to anyone. Enjoy your app.  :)
__label__0 This app sucks don't get it the first day I got it it frozeup it sucks they should pay us to get it and it still wouldn't be worth it just don't get it.
__label__0 It limited him to certain featured videos and did not let him search for the ones he wanted. The browser on his Kindle Fire HD was acting up, so he thought this would be a nice add like the youtube button on his ipod touch.
__label__0 I do not like this youtube app. so if I do not like it you shod to.this is not a good app a bit!
__label__1 This app is just awsome. Ignore all the negative comments, the app might have been bad last year but now its great, works fine
__label__1 This app performs  perfectly on my Kindle Fire. The &quot;threat&quot; detected by my anti-virus seems to be due to the permissions the app is using and nothing malicious in nature.It's likely just a result of a heuristic analysis done by the anti-virus 
__label__1 its a useful app I recommend it to anyone I dont have to pay to download any type of song its so GOOD......:-)
__label__0 This app is great but when I play a video, right in the middle of one it keeps saying SORRY, THIS VIDEO CANNOT BE PLAYED
__label__1 I love that it's updated with right things it's something I would recommend to everyone it's just amazing........Good...better ...best...never let this rest
__label__1 THE NEW VERSION IS AVAILABLE NOW, ITS THE 2.2.9... I RECOMMEND DELETING THE OLD VERSION BEFORE DOWNLOADING THE NEW I have nothing else to say so I'm just filling in .........
__label__0 This app is terrible, why is this 4 stars?! It runs like a virus and it only have like 15 videos on here and you don't even get to pick them out... don't get this app it's terrible. THE END
__label__1 i can get songs from you tube that i couldnt get at the store and some that is possible from the store for free ty for this app.

__label__1 This app is the best app on my kindle fire because when your on the go you need  some entertaining stuff
__label__1 My kids are always on You Tube.  We travel  180 miles round trip on weekends and it keeps them occupied.  I am constantly inform by social media about something to watch for on YouTube.
__label__1 This app works exactly as advertised. I downloaded a 5min video over 3g and it played offline just fine using mVideo player.  Using DX with rooted OTA Gingerbread.
__label__1 I was pleasently surprised with this app. with the new update you can see thumbnails but don't press the search button or it crashes the app.
__label__1 At first I was skeptical about his app. But after seeing someone use I downloaded it. I works tremendous and I get to listen to all my favorite songs for free!!!!!!!!!! there is no doubt in my mind that anyone who like to listen to music will want this a
__label__1 This is way beyyer than having to actually have to buy music when you could just get this. i recomend this for everyone who wants to have music...
__label__1 I like this app for searching on you tube. It's useful and can be addicting when you search videos available.
__label__1 This app is freakin' amazing!!! Download any youtube video to mp4 format or any music video on youtube to mp3. I used this to download db's episodes 192-267 and all of them worked fine. Then I transferred those files to a flash drive, and then put them o
__label__1 I freaking love it. There are some songs on you tube that I can't seem to find to download so I love the fact that I can convert them mp3 and listen to them in my library without Internet connection on my kindle fire :D
__label__0 just downloaded new version. nothing works. get message saying connection quality is bad. I run on kindle fire. it worked perfectly on the last version!
__label__0 Do not get this app it runs like a virus and it also crashed my kindle I had to restart it twice and the last update caused all of this because all of my Anit-virus protection programs detected it as MALWARE so trust me do not get this app
__label__0 okay, so I have had this app for more than 6 or 7 months on my Kindle Fire.... and well now, it doesn't want to download anything!! I have tried deleting some songs to see if it was because I have too many and I have even uninstalled it! but now it still

__label__1 This app is amazing. You can get any song for free! Just search for the music video on the app. Download the file as a mp3, or audio, and it will download and save the song in your music file. It is amazing. I downloaded so many songs on this along with 
__label__1 I love this app you can download your favorate videos on your device! I have had the best time with this app. hope you enjoy it to.
__label__1 I love this. I don't have Wi-Fi at home. I use my phone as a hotspot, therefore, I have a limited about of data to spare. It's nice to load up a couple of my son's favorite videos so he can watch them when the tablet is not online.  It's easy, too.
__label__1 This app is exactly what it says. Downloaded videos to the app to play locally without an Internet connection. works great!
__label__0 it was horrible. i got a few songs and a couple days later... BAM!!! a virus hit. dont get this. it could ruin your kindle. luckily my lookout app warned me.thank god. my kindle is safe now.
__label__0 this app is terrible. I do not recommend it to anyone. it is disorganized and not fast. I would tell people not to download it, and just type YouTube into their web browser.
__label__1 This works great. It allows me to put ANY youtube video onto my Kindle Fire. Just open this app, search for a video, click it and tell it so save as video. I can take funny videos to work and show them off with out internet there.
__label__0 it broke while I was watching &quot;there goes a fighter&quot;.I want to give this a 0 star!! booo please fix!
__label__1 I like you tube because you can get a lot of video and dun stuff and most of them are fun.
__label__0 Don't download this app! It won't let you search anything, it crashes all the time, my kindle almost got some virus from it. Download this, and you'll regret it.
__label__0 DON'T GET IT. THIS APP HAS A VIRUS!! I downloaded this app for my kindle fire hd and did a virus scan and lo and behold this app had a virus. That's one of the thing I hate about android. You can actually download an app with a  virus on it to ruin your

__label__1 Works good for me, watched a video then downloaded it and rewatched the local copy. I'm on an epic 4g so I'm confirming it works on this phone. Aside from the download of the video being a little slow &quot;F#%^ you sprint&quot;. This works as listed!

__label__0 I have no idea what happened to this app, but I used to be able to download or watch any video's online on my Kindle Fire. Now it continually comes up with a error message so it is not worth downloading.
__label__1 This YouTube download is fun and I know alot of people like YouTube download even if it's another YouTube download as long as they get it and to download stuff to listen to,it's likeable for alot of people and children.
__label__0 This app is stupid. If you want YouTube then go on to the internet(silk). It is still pretty bad there but it is better.
__label__0 This is a not a good app and doesn't work well with my Kindle Fire. As a new owner I see some apps work well on it and some do not. This is not a keeper.

__label__1 The you tube app for iPhone is terrific.  I downloaded this for my Kindle Fire.  Don't like it nearly as much.  Very confusing and sends you all around the place.  I probably need time to get used to it but the app for iPhone is just easier and more intu
__label__1 I always used to have a problem getting You Tube to download for me.  I never could seem to get it to do that, so I never got onto You Tube even though I had an account there, All I have to do now is click on it and Voila!  It opens right up for me.  Lov

__label__1 for along time I've been looking for something like this app where I could download youtube videos For FREE.When I found this app I was excited.Now I use this app EVERY day which I usually don't do.I use it for me and my family.
__label__0 I had this app for awhile, but then it won't download anymore videos!As soon as wifi was gone, it wouldn't play anything! I WANT THIS FIXED!
__label__0 APP IS NOT GOOD AT ALL . USES ALL LOT OF SPACE.  DO NOT LIKE IT.  NOT WORTH 5 OR EVEN 1

__label__1 Easy to use (provided you have Flash) and is a great convenience.  I've even downloaded movies as well as tunes.
__label__0 thought this was a no brainer app, turns out some things really are worth what you pay for them....this is worthless!
__label__1 This one is not hard for me to use.  I am new to using this kind of ape, once my grandchild explained it. I have been  enjoying every minute of it.
__label__1 Just Kidding this is the worst app it creates viruses! DO NOT GET THIS APP!!!!!!! It is not good at all!!!
__label__1 I was trying to view videos from another app that I had downloaded and was not able to because I don't have an Ipad or something that uses Itunes. I found this app and thought I would give it a shot, and it works great.  Now I can view whatever I want.
__label__1 Was skeptical but I love this app! Can simply watch or download. Def worth getting. I am now hooked on it - so far better than any other youtube downloader for the kindle.
__label__1 I don't know about everybody else but I love this app because you can download anything from youtube that you want for free!! You can also download music! I use this app all the time. If your like me and don't want to spend money on videos and music then
__label__0 it will not let me down load or watch.  ug it used to let me.  but after i gave it an interveiw when i first got it it went really bad
__label__0 Okay. I loved this app honestly. I used it to download EVER bit of my music. Now it's not letting me download anything, as a MP3 or Video. It wont even let me view it online. So I say, update it to where it works, and ill change my rate.
__label__1 I don't understand all the bated reviews. I thought it was very helpful and good. It wouldn't open a few times,  but it 's worth it ...
__label__1 I have YouTube on my other devices and it worked great.  It was fun watching the short films.  I haven't yet tried it out on my Kindle Fire HD, but I'm sure I will love it on that device too.
__label__0 It Doesn't work on kindle fire... will not let you download... keeps telling me to re-install.. I re-install and doesn't work...
__label__0 Apps that download You Tube videos violate the YouTube TOS (Terms Of Service) Several apps on Google play have been removed for violating the rules of other websites. Have nothing against downloading you tube videos but I won't because I respect their ru
__label__1 this app is the best u long click it then click download as video and it goes to ur gallery so u can listen to anything without wifi
__label__0 It's pretty bad it works for a while then stops after that it's a waste of time I would just go to the web and go to you tube there it's the same quality.
__label__1 I love music so much with the amount of money I spent before this app I could've ...... well I don't know what I could've done but it was a lot of money anyway now any song or album I can get... its awesome...  ive had few issues on my kindle but nothing

__label__1 I absolutely love this app. this is where i get all my music from. its very handy indeed. i suggest it to EVERYONE. this is one of many good apps besides the games :D
__label__0 it did work for awhile and was great... now nothing cant do anything with it..... going to have to find a different app..
__label__1 It's not really a virus, ignore the idiots below who listen to whatever their virus scanner viruses tell them. It has gotten better the last few updates. Faster download time, less likely for a non-compatible video, and now a fancy new icon!! Keep up the
__label__1 This app can help me listen to music even if I cannot access YouTube. Many times, YT crashes on my phone especially during a lengthy song but this app allows me to continue to listen. I don't have any problems with this app and all the music I listen too
__label__1 You tube has some interesting thing to watch and reflect on some of them are quite funny and amusing.Happy watching
__label__1 I absolutely love the option to download a video as an mp3, and there are no problems whatsoever on my Fire. It works very well. :)
__label__0 It was a descent app, but it doesn't let you search videos well. It will sign you out, make you reopen it, search again then work. It hasn't let me play videos lately and has st opp op-ed working completely.
__label__1 awesome! Just search any song that is on YouTube and it will download it to your music library! I love this app!
__label__0 this app has no key bord at all cant tipe at all it is so bad that I deleted it do not buy and if you have it you are a sucker.
__label__0 This app has a virus and you should not buy it because it will pop up as a malicious app. DO NOT BUY!!!!!
__label__0 I have no idea if this works or not, so don't take my low rating as a statement about it not working... It might, I just haven't used it yet so have to rate it according to my favorite apps and not so favorites.
__label__1 My buddies say that the app is kinda a virus but when I downloaded this it was perfect! I downloaded it because youtube on the Internet did not work on my kindle tablet. Sure a few adds pop up above the screen but I don't seem to mind it at all. Though, 
__label__1 I CANNOT LIVE WITHOUT THIS APP ANYMORE! IT ROCKS AND IS SO FAST AND EASY TO USE.. btw kindle users, the videos save into your gallery.
__label__1 Love the cool videos, I'm on it every day laughing at the things I see also love the fact that my family are also posted and I can see them.

__label__1 works great, if you love searching for videos, use this app daily enjoy that it was free too...easy to use

__label__1 This app is simply incredible. I mean, free video and music downloads? Heck, I love it! Greatest app I've ever used. Sadly, the update destroyed it, but I looked at one of the other reveiws, and 30 seconds later I had a fixed version. Go to the app, sett
__label__1 great to find little video's for the grandkids to watch. they really enjoy this and it is easy to use.
__label__1 I love this app so much. it lets you watch any youtune movie any time any where and it only takes WI -FI to download the video to your list.
__label__1 I have downloaded a lot of free apps onto my Kindle Fire. Many are pretty much worthless and I get rid of them after only a few tries. Either they don't work or they are just lame. This app is very cool because it's so simple. It's designed to allow the 
__label__1 toughness downloaded is not a virus it really does work some people just talk bad about it because they probably made an app similar to it but it didn't work and now.there taking.bad about them
__label__1 it works perfectly and I can download/watch any video I want! great app. I don't need wifi to watch the videos once they're downloaded which is great and it only takes about a minute to download a video
__label__0 this apo used to work great better than great really but lately it hasnt been working when i try to play the mp3's i download does anyone know whats wrong with it
__label__1 Okay, so officially this is the best app ever for downloading and receiving free music. Yes sometimes there are glitches but if you exit and go back into it then it will work just fine. If downloads aren't working then remove from device and install agai
__label__1 This app works very well - simple clean look to it as well. The search bar makes it easy to find what you are looking for.
__label__0 After I had a total of 70+ songs, it started to stop downloading songs. Waste of time, you've been warned!
__label__0 I downloaded this app, and my virus scanner IMMEDIATELY told me it was malicious. I then deleted it. But save your device and DO NOT BUY! Also, copy this comment so others can see.
__label__0 This app did not work for my kindle fire. The search worked, but the download button did absolutely nothing. After uninstalling this flop, i got tubemate, which worked fine. Yeah, get tubemate.
__label__1 so great use it as limewire flawlessly no problems fast down loads tons of music h h h h h b h
__label__1 The only issue I have is the fact in runs &quot;kind&quot; of sluggishly (not a big deal though). Also, the search feature isn't like the one on the actual website, which still gives my the search results desired even if I spell something wrong.
__label__1 it's simple to use and downloads super fast. only way this could be better is if I could download videos off other websites too!
__label__0 I had this app for a long time and when I decided to download a song earlier this week, it stopped working. It really only works to download the video, not the mp3. Do not get this app at all.
__label__1 its like free music with videos! I love it when I don't have wick and cant use Pandora it works great on my kindle fire
__label__0 I can't download or even watched practically  anything. I believe that FREEdi youtube downloader plus lets you watch anything but it's $2.00. What a rip off. I don't know about you but I'm a major YouTuber and I need to have the full version, and I don't
__label__1 They have recently updated their software making it more difficult to save some videos, at least on my Kindle. I don't save too many because of space but once in awhile I like having them when I don't have an Internet connection.
__label__1 So many topics to choose from for whatever mood you're in, Love the DIYF on there, music lessons and everything else you can think of. Keep it safe, thanks
__label__1 This works great on my tablet.  My other YouTube Player app didn't work so I missed out on a lot of great videos.
__label__0 Worked great for a day. Created playlists, listened to them at work.  Next day, MP3 download doesn't work, errors trying to play downloaded videos, can't play next video in playlist; causes errors, and my favorite, keeps playing the audio even though the

__label__1 I just downloaded this app and so far it works fine. I downloaded my favorite minecraft songs and they play just like I'm in youtube. It was confusing at first but I figured it out and am still adding my fagorite videos. The app works great! Er... so far
__label__1 It is a great app but there is a lot of bad stuff on you tube so wen you get this app and your a kid bring it to your parents so they can block things
__label__1 It works perfectly for me. No virus no ads no nothing since the update. All I can say is that it is a great app. I love it!! It's simple and no complex situations.
__label__1 Awesome so far. I have downloaded several videos and mp3s so far. Videos work perfectly both stores on my phone (evo) our when transferred to my macbook.So far only about 2 of the 4 mp3s have played on the computer though they all play on the phone. Most
__label__1 actually, I really like this app. I can download songs when Im at home, and then I can play them when I'm at a baseball game :D I really like it and it is a really nice app. good job!!!!
__label__1 The greatest I would die if i couldnt see my you tube every day its awsome . Whatever the mood or if i want to reflect in the past its there
__label__1 It does exactly what I wanted it to do, and works great. I love how after I've downloaded videos,  I can watch them without an Internet connection. And I absolutely LOVE how I can download the mp3 versions of songs for free!! This is a great app. I've ha
__label__1 This just works and downloads are quicker than expected on our lousy connection.I find nothing to criticize in this  app.
__label__1 Its YouTube whats not to like?  Plays video's that people upload for free.  If you watch youtube you need this app.
__label__1 This app is just amazing. I can download songs and videos for free and it is very high quality. I would definitely recommend this to anyone.
__label__1 When I first got this app I was so happy! I could final watch youtube videos on my Kindle Fire. And the best part was I got to download my favorite videos on to my Kindle. And I never got a problem yet with it. That's why I am rating it 5 stars.
__label__1 I was able to download all my favorite songs that I didn't have on my ipod mini or anything else. its good because u dont need Internet to listen to previously downloaded songs. I love the playlist feature so I can listen to music and not have to worry a
__label__1 I dont see why people say its malware it runs perfect for me and is a nice program if you want to download your favorate youtubers latest vidio and not want to wait for youtube to load in the middle of the video
__label__1 I wanted a you tube on my kindle so I got this one works great. I could even watch musci vidoes on this really cool...
__label__0 there's something wrong with this app. every time I try to play a video it says:&quot;this video cannot be played outside the official youtube app&quot;3 things:one, it was working fine a few months ago so what happened?Two, what is the official youtube 
__label__0 ever since I downloaded the update the app does not open. I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling,  restarting my kindle and nothing. the app just automatically forces close.
__label__1 Nice app, haven't found anything bad yet. Fyi, to search for videos hit menu and then it's the magnifying glass.
__label__1 Excellent app. You can save a copy of the video as a video clip or mp3 to view or listen to anytime on your device. I love this app!
__label__1 I am in love with this app! it is great because it allows so many options, some being to download the actual video or just download the music... you just press the search button and type in what you want and it comes up... you press the title and then se
__label__1 This is probably the best app available on the Kindle Fire. Rather than having to pay $1.20 for a new song, I can easily download it for free. I LOVE it!
__label__1 I like this application because it allows you to download videos flowlessly. you can find application like this anywhere else
__label__1 This app is brilliant! I downloaded it on my kindle fire and it works perfectly. You can download any video from youtube for free!! It's great on kindle fire but I believe it may not work so well on other android devices. Still love it though!!!!!!!
__label__0 unfortunately, they just had to add the download as mp3 button. This makes it incredibly easy to pirate music. i don't want to use this anymore, now that i found that out. i suggest that amazon removes this app before the other industries find out.
__label__0 I had no problem getting this to work but after downloading, my phone kept receiving spam, which had never happened before.  I downloaded Antivirus  and it tagged this as malicious.  Uninstalled.
__label__1 I love the fact that I can get the lyrics as well as hear the music and enjoy for free
__label__1 this is a pretty good app. just copy the title from the actual website of youtube , paste it in the search thing.enter.
__label__1 Quickly downloads videos from youtube and searching is easy. I find it easy to navigate and easy to use. Gets my Thumbs Up!
__label__0 this is Im pretty sure the WORST APPL EVER. becuz u cant search anything they give u random dumb videos.and it keeps telling me about some virus.  So I earased it HA in ur face stupid youtube app ( well not yet but I'm gonads after my review ) anyway DO 
__label__1 Many hours of laughter ensue when you open U Tube. We particularly find pet videos fun to watch as a family.
__label__1 I love this app!!! I have a kindle fire and I can download as either video or as music/mp3!!!I strongly sudgest it!
__label__0 When you first see this app, you'd expect it to be totally amazing, being able to download music and videos to your tablet. And that's what I thought when I purchased it. Although, it was overloading with ads - even inappropriate ones - that were useless
__label__1 works great.  I use it on my nook tablet and phone. Good for downloading funny mp4's, or mp3's, even AAC formats.
__label__0 I downloaded hecka videos of lyrics and videos and it said my connection was bad and I was standing right next to my box and I had all 4 bars perfect connection works perfect at first but then ducks don't waste memory
__label__1 a really enjoyed this app I think people who watch videos on youtube often should get this the idea of this app is great and I have no problems with it
__label__1 amazing app. now I can watch videos w/o Internet and listen to my favorite songs. get this app! it works perfectly!
__label__1 If the picture of the album art stays the same all the time, search &quot;album art grabber apk&quot; on the web. That should help you.
__label__0 It used to run smoothly and load,but since the last &quot;update&quot; it doesn't work at all!When I try to make it load it won't load!I loved it before the update but now it's just plain dead to me!
__label__1 why do you need this if you have the Internet on the kindle you just click on web and type in youtube bam videos I saw this and thought u wouldng need Internet but you do so I was definatly not gonna get this

__label__0 THIS APP IS SPYWARE!!! after I downloaded this app it would no longer let me connect to wifi. when I ran my anti virus it flagged this program and removed it. the problem with the wifi was fixed right after I removed the youtube downloader.
__label__0 Until a recent update, it worked fine.  Now it only reports an internet error on view or download!  please fix!
__label__1 This app works in conjunction with other apps. Anything youtube is great to own. I am more equipped for downloads.

__label__0 it obviously has issues!...it worked for awhile...then started having problems on and off...then just quit all together...my kindle support couldnt find nouthing wrong....its obviously inferior!!!
__label__0 Does not work on my Android.
__label__0 I download thinking that is play me music on the go. But, the more music I download, the more it take up on my kindle fire. Terrible App. NOOOO DOWNLOAD
__label__1 Not much to say except if you're used to Firefox's "downloadhelper" then this should be right up your alley. Basically, what you do is "long press" a video or song on youtube while using your android/kindle and a series of options will pop up to download
__label__0 I got this app and it worked fine at first. when the updated version came out, it wont even search a song. please fix this.
__label__1 I LOVE the Starkid productions, and have always wanted their musicals with me wherever I went (I don't have any of that 4-G stuff), and after downloading them (which took a very short time) I have them and any other videos I want on my Kindle! The only t
__label__0 I downloaded a video and it took a longtime to load and then it wouldent let me watchit! I would give this zero if I could.
__label__1 its great if u don't no how to do it shut up u guys r wrong u don't no what u r talking about
__label__1 just satin amazing perfect for me and anyone who likes to dance sing and have fun all of ya haters yr tones are wacko just saying kk byee
__label__1 This app works perfectly on the Droid X. Could use an update that lets you download larger files for video though and some kind of indication that it's not going to download the file. Great app nonetheless!
__label__1 I love this app. I use it to download a lot of music. This app is great for downloading a lot of videos and music. I would definitely recommend this app to everyone I know.
__label__0 My kindle fire alerted me the second it downloaded that it is a malicious application. I uninstalled it immediately. BUYER BEWARE.
__label__0 NOT AS GOOD AS OLD YOU TUBE.. WOULD NOT LET ME SERCH, ONLY GAVE ME WHAT IT WANTED AND THAT WAS IT.. NOT A GOOD PRODUCT
__label__1 When I first tried this, and 2 other You Tube downloaders [TubeMP3 Machine, and TubeMate YouTube Downloader] none of them worked on my Kindle Fire. I gave up on them all, till I came across a You Tube video on how to install and use this one. I tried it 
__label__1 i have had this app for a year now on ny kindle fire .. no problems  actually the best app i ever downloaded
__label__1 Why cause this app it so full of moviesAnd it's easy to use. I love it andDownloading its easy and fun youCould download 3 movies at once.
__label__1 pf course youtube is worth it  or u cn juz use the internet but easier access i guess . . .
__label__1 I am using this on a kindle fire. I was able to download the videos and view them. I didn't have to pay and it was easy. pretty happy about it :) I recommend this app.
__label__1 great for occasions such as road trips where you feel the need to laugh at your favorite videos or listen to free music
__label__1 this is a gr8 app that lets you download songs and videos from youtube and whatch videos. gr8. no viruses or anything. force closes once in a while.but nothing bigot..
__label__1 I like youtube alot. It was free through Amazon and I love Amazon. I can download music for my laptop and my ereader. I like listen to music while i clean, when i', cooking or taking a shower but mostly when i'm laying in my bed quietly in my baby's arms
__label__0 Horrible spammed my kindle I just want a app that I can watch youtube on not where you 'donwload it' and get a virus do not buy!!
__label__1 yeah you get all the videos from youtube, but not longer than 15. min, has viruses, and takes up all your internal space
__label__0 This app sucks! I got this app because my youtube wasn't working. so I got this thing. this doesn't tell you how many views. this has bad visual quality and ia overall a bad decision
__label__1 This app is perfect for anyone with iffy wifi signal. When ur in a wifi signal, just simply search ur favorite youtube videos and download them straight to ur kindle! PERFECT if u want free songs... Or want to watch ur favorite youtube classics on the go
__label__1 Works just fine unlike almost all other youtube  apps.  search button doesn't work, you have to go through the menues.
__label__1 I love it its my main spice of entertainment when ur on the go and don't have Internet u can be prepared with some downloaded videos. LIFESAVER
__label__1 This app lets me download any video, music, etc. whenever I want. I can just watch videos normal or hold down the video and I can download it
__label__1 so great so many funny videos on it i like the gangman dance with the mom and son and all the crazy cat pics
__label__1 This is great app. I don't understand what's going on with other peoples devices because ot works just fine on my Kindle Fire. I've had this app for almost 2 years now and sometimes it will say 'force close' but then when you go back into it, it will wor

__label__0 It was working great until I decided I wanted to download more videos then whenever I selected a video and hit download as a video, I would check the videos downloading and it would say file size not available yet. I have plenty of data room available. I

__label__0 I've been using Tubemate and then saw this one and thought I would try it. This one force closes on me all the time and doesn't have as clean a look as Tubemate. Tubemate also gives me more options for video quality, download or watch, and the presentati
__label__1 Not sure if it still exists on the market but it worked fine when I had it. i loved it. Kinda boring but i downloaded some accounting videos and watched later to do my home work.

__label__1 Don't listen to those 1-2 star reviews. They don't know what there talking about.It works on kindle fire. For those of you who are giving 4-5 star reviewsyou are fine. But if you give 1-2 star reviews then your wrong (and I'm sorry for those of you who g

__label__0 When I downloaded this app, I expected it to download movies and videos that I wanted off of YouTube, but I was wrong.  It took about 2 or 3 minutes for a video to download, and whenever I go to the Personal Videos app on my Amazon Kindle Fire HD Tablet 
__label__1 It's youtube, I mean what can you say.? It works and it's free. Free is good! Nothing is different from the one you use on everything else.
__label__1 I have yet to experience any trouble with this app! Quick, easy, and entertaining! Best of all, it's FREE!!!! Highly recommended!
__label__1 I use this app fairly often and it works just great - never had a problem.  Wish I had it long ago.
__label__0 Stopped downloading video a long time ago. Its now a complete waste and why does it need to read sensitive log data?.....
__label__1 this is the best app i have...you can download any video on youtube as a video or an m.p.3 so if you lose wifi you will still have it
__label__0 This app stinks. It just gives you a list of recommended videos. You can't even pick your own. I want to be able to pick a video I want to watch/listen to. If they don't have your video that you want, it's useless.
__label__1 this app freaking awesome I love it I can get any song I want on my kindle fire and plays very well too
__label__1 If you like YouTube like I do.  This is a must have app!!!  Very very easy to get a video you like. This is a awesome App!!!
__label__0 if you think you are going to be able to look up videos and download them, then im pretty sure you're wrong unless i didn't look hard enough but i couldn't find it so i do not recommend this app
__label__0 I loved this app. Best app ever but it quit working! Please fix this. I want my music back. There's no updates.
__label__0 This app's not easy to use--if and when it works. It crashed so much I gave up on it and got Playtube, which works Much better.
__label__0 this product wasn't what i was looking for and i was able to find a product that better suited my needs
__label__1 You tube is awesome. I watch it a lot. So this app was nice. I get to You tube fast. I use it for my Kindle fire.
__label__1 Its a great app because you can put free songs and videos on your kindle for free. I know I said free twice.
__label__1 I was very cautious of this ap due to some of the reviews and really didn't think it would work.  Its GREAT!  I downloaded a few songs and spent half the day yesterday watching random vids.  Its so much faster and easier than watching vids elsewhere.  I

__label__1 this is a pretty good app.  works as described.  interface is not spectacular, but is definitely functional.  overall 5 stars
__label__0 This app worked fine until the update. I had 71 songs downloaded from it (you can download media), and they all deleted about a week after the update. Also, all of the videos that I had downloaded also deleted. I used to be able to view videos, but not i

__label__1 It looks like this app was a little scary in 2010, so it has a very bad, but very old review, that people see when they first look for this.  It's 2014, and it works well on my Kindle, seems safe and lets me download YouTube videos.  Very nice. Please "l

__label__1 This app works beautifully on kindle fire. Personally,I love it! :) I use it all the time. It is an awesome app to have.
__label__1 This app is awesome! It saved me $50 worth of songs you would normally buy for .99$ a song. But using this I got the same songs for free! For those of you who are saying, &quot;couldn't get it to work&quot; I think you should put some of that blame on yo
__label__1 For all of you who have the kindle fire and can't find your videos, here's a review. Go to your gallery. Click on the Icon that says videos. BTW.... THIS APP ROCKS!!!
__label__0 Horrible app.  Locks up constantly. Glad i did buy it.dont waste your time with this app. It sucks big time. Waste of time
__label__0 This app doesn&apos;t work. I installed it and it will search for videos but when you go to download something it says it is searching, but never downloads anything. it also will not play any of the videos either.
__label__1 Omigosh this app is amazing on the kindle fire!!! I love one direction and i got a bunch of their music!! This app is awesome and i wish i would have downloaded it sooner!!!:)
__label__0 this app is crape it wont download anything and it locks up my kindle fire when the screen goes black I wouldn't get this again if I needed it to save the world this sucks so much

__label__1 This an excellent app that my grand-daughter loves and so does the rest of the family. The price can't be beat it's free and will be getting hundreds if not thousands of uses.Kudos to Amazon for another excellent free App.
__label__0 Android AntiVirus app show that this is a malicious app. Tried it on 2 different phones with different AntiVirus apps and both came back with the same warning.
__label__0 Its dumb. Not worth your time. They are just stupid videos that random people put on. DO NOT GET IT!
__label__1 Freedi youtube downloader is the best. You can download any videos that you want on this app. I tried other you tube downloading apps but I didn't like em so I think that this app is the best for downloading videos from you tube.
__label__0 Doesnt do any thing but list videos. No play, no download, no nothing. Waste of a download. Now the damn thing is stuck in my list of apps.
__label__1 I see that a lot of reviewers were having trouble with malware, but at this point (3/14), it is not malicious.  Works just as I expected.
__label__1 I get all the video I can stand. Wish I had wireless at work so I can view when ever I want.

__label__1 For those times when a link wont normally let you open, evil grin with victory exclaim "thou shall not hide from me!"
__label__0 This is a scam, a ripoff, whatever you want to call it. Maybe it works for others, it doesn't work on mine. It's just trash.

__label__1 I use this on my kindle fire and it is so far flawless! You can search youtube and download a video as a video, mp3,  or AAC. Then you can view the video or song WITHOUT INTERNET CONNECTION!!A+ so far!!

__label__1 It works very amazingly on Kindle Fire. So far I haven't had any problems, so I rate it 5 stars.
__label__1 works incredibly well for if u bust want to watch a video later and you can download a video as an mp3 too! so if you find a song you like just find it on there and download it as an mp3 ...its basicly free music!
__label__1 This makes it incredibly easy to view my You Tube content when I am away from home, or when others in my household are busy on my PC! Love it.
__label__1 Not good as a YouTube browser, but good for watching and downloading the video and its audio! I love this! Good job MicroMacro Mobile Inc. !
__label__1 I have been looking for a program like this for foreer dor my computer! Its awesome to have on my phone. I love being able to get unique songs that I couldnt find anywhere! It works well even without wifi, and its very easy to use!

__label__1 with this app I'm able to download all of my favorite Tv shows and watch them on long road trips
__label__1 Was a bit hard to find out how to search. But once you find out where the search button hides all is well.
__label__0 This app compliments YouTube and adds the highly desirable video download feature. However, after maybe a year of using it happily it stopped working about couple of weeks ago (not sure if there was an update that broke it or maybe YouTube changed someth
__label__0 This app throws a lot of videos at you but I was unable to search for what I wanted. So I moved on to Tubemate, a lot better downloader.
__label__0 I am not certain, but after I installed this ok my mytouch 4g, my antivirus (Creative  Apps' Antivirus Free) reported that this app is malicious and that it is strongly recommended that I uninstall it.I did, of course, and now I post this so you too can 
__label__0 This app I got (thinking it would be good) WAS TERRIBLE!!!! This is a very stupid app. You can't even search for videos! All you do is look through a short list of vids. In my opinion this app should have never been made!!!
__label__1 now I have musicon my kindle fire at last!!!! yay!! u need to get!! u can download in mp3 and video gallery!!!!
__label__1 I love youtube so of course I loved this app when I had it that is.... Youtube is a great website!!!!

__label__0 Will lock up your device and ruin it. Had to do a re install after running this. BE AWARE ITS EITHER A VIRUS OR A BAD PROG. STAY AWAY FROM THIS. It will freeze up your device, or even worse lock it up for good.
__label__0 it won't even let me view the video, download the video or even download the mp3.  freaking thing worked before now it totally sucks.
__label__1 I downloaded because seen before and wanted to try sometime. I don't know what all reviews are of virus and malware stuff. I downloaded and lookout didn't say it was. Downloaded a YouTube video and it worked ok and had no issues.
__label__0 THIS APP IS MESSING UP MY KINDLE FIRE ITS REALLY BAD DO NOT GET THIS APP PLEASE DONT GET THIS APP

__label__1 it was a great app until the latest update it just freezes when I try to download something then it reboots :/
__label__1 It is excellent for Kindle Fire, Good size, and easier to read the comments.  I use it often till I get a new TV which have YouTube so I only watch on Kindle Fire when I am outside or travel.  But it is really great to add it to Kindle Fire.
__label__1 I have used this App to download You Tube Videos that my laptop could not.  Then I transfer the video to my laptop.  I have had no problems with this app what-so-ever and think it is a great feature on my tablet and phone.

__label__1 Works great! I love using this to find videos that I'll want to show to friends in places that don't have Wi-Fi. It's great to be able to have all my favorite videos with me, wherever I go.
__label__0 I couldn't get the videos onto my Kindle fire with this app.  Could have been me, but I found it a waste of time.
__label__0 Not sure what its for.  I have no idea why I even bothered.  Someone else may just love it.  Not me.
__label__1 This is 1 of my very favorite apps! I love being able to read PDFs on my Kindle instead of sitting at my computer.I'm mostly blind, so PDFs are a challenge.On my Kindle fire, I can also have it read to me. This app crashes often when reading PDFs with my

__label__1 With this app you can have anything form what ever email address you have stored. I like taking special things with me and you willl too.
__label__1 I am in love with this technology. I can now put everything I want/need on my Kindle for access later. It is a very small app and works every time. I even use it to transfer JPEG's.
__label__1 This is a great and fun product. I am so glad I got this one. I use it all the time.
__label__1 No longer do I have to do an email. This app works and it is quite quick depending on the file size. I will be happily using this great app.
__label__1 You can easily send any document or web Site to your kindle cloud for download - simple to use and a great way to keep something important to read at another time.  Preview lets you see what your document will look like.
__label__1 This handy program allows me to send docs from my PC to my kindle.  It came in handy for teaching at a youth camp where no internet was available.  I also carried copies of my papers for a class to the class on it.  Saves paper and ink.  :-)
__label__1 I'm a photojournalist on the Gulf Coast. We don't fool around during hurricane season down here. This app shows a variety of active radar, satellite and tracking map loops with weather reports that look great on a Kindle Fire. It is winter now and things
__label__1 HOPE I do not have to use it to see what is coming my way. Great GRAPHICS and near real time info.
__label__1 I love this app. Displays various maps, weather service info, tracking maps and more. I used it on the go to watch the changing paths for the storms in the Gulf this summer. Works well on Viewpad 7e.
__label__1 I live in Florida and to have a hurricane tracker to take anywhere is great .it is easy to read and understand
__label__1 i live on the Gulf coast and there are plenty hurricanes now because the water is warm if you need a hurricane tracker get this one  it is very good thanks thomas a.
__label__0 Pretty much what the reviewers said. They really need to come out with a better spell checker for the kindle fire. Don't waste your time with this one, its a real lemon.
__label__0 I downloaded this after 6 times closeing out on me when hit spell check. I can say delete ...  if it would work that would be nice as not many spell checks when looked.
__label__0 I absolutely hate this app! All you can do is open it up, write a few words, press the spell check button, and then it closes. I wouldn't be surprised if this app gets taken off the app store. Don't waste your time. Get a different app!
__label__0 I tried this app as a spell checker for my daughter,whom is in kindergarten and it is of very low grade.I purposely misspelled a word to check the accuracy and it said &#34;no misspellings&#34;..I must have missed the memo from Webster that the new spell
__label__0 It is not a spell checker. It does not help you spell anything. Im glad I did not have to pay for it.
__label__0 After it finds incorrectly spelled words, it colors them red.  When you press on a word to see the suggestions,  it crashes.  Useless!
__label__1 It is unbelievably accurate, at least for a Cancer such as myself. It provides you with a lot of information, all which I found extremely interesting.
__label__1 It was free, so I decided to try it.  Very interesting and accurate.I like the blending of astrology and numerology.  Good App !!
__label__1 At first, I was like how does this work. but when I figured it out, I was proud of myself. I have been going through a tough time in my life so the words this app gave me were very nice to hear!!!!!!
__label__1 I was expecting some bs horoscope app, but this app gave me a dead on description of myself. I was in shock reading what it had to say about me! Great astrology and numerology app!
__label__0 This kind of crap has stood in the way of real science and any kind of progress for too long. The human race needs to move past it. If you&apos;re bored play angry birds, at least that kind of takes some small level of brain activity.
__label__1 great motivation. i can relate much of my self.  a lot of things i need to appreciate my self worth. Thanks for this app.
__label__1 Mine is seriously 100% on point!!! I couldn&apos;t believe and still don&apos;t! I keep reading it in amazement!! This is spooky but very also interesting
__label__1 I enjoy things like this and this app was pretty accurate on myself and others I tried it on. I don't know if these things are coincidental or not but I enjoy using this. It's technically supposed to entertain and it has done it's job well. I'd love to f
__label__1 this is a great app it is so true I want to be a writer and I have a taste for sweets, drugs and sex and I'm very attractive it's just I don't lose weight easily and I don't really like attention and lash out a lot plus I'm sensitive but I hide well and 
__label__1 Simple to use and whether or not you find it to be accurate (as I did) it will motivate you to be more introspective...always a good thing. Also great for starting heart to heart dialogues and conversations.\n
__label__1 this app was amazing it told me about myself and trust me it was right in a lot of the stuff it said about me what an amazing app u should definitely get it
__label__0 I wasn't very happy after I downloaded this app... I spent real coins and got a limited and boring app. Please don't waste your time on this app! It's not worth it at all!
__label__1 Buy the full version, ads hinder children's enjoyment.  Kids will love this.  My daughter spends time with Larry every day, laughing the whole time.
__label__1 My nine month old daughter loves this app! She giggles at everything the bird does. There is nothing better than a laughing baby!
__label__1 This is a cute little interactive guy, the kids love him and it encourages some to have fun therefore if you have kids or elderly they really enjoy this and have fun with it as well..
__label__1 Whomever creates the animated creatures has a great sense of humor and when I need a chuckle and also feel the need to do similar to whack a mole often at fairs , well Larry suits my need to laugh , knock him off and just love it!
__label__1 Talking Larry app is a bird that will repeat everything you say back in a squeaky voice.But you do have to talk slow to get the best sounding response. Do too fast and it will sound like a different language ha ha. You can play a piano which makes Larry 
__label__0 this app is so stupid, 1.you cant change your paint colors.  2.it just looks like marker.  3.you cant erase or do anything just draw.
__label__0 I opened it up it had the illumination eye symbol n other devil symbols I am being serious donor get this app it has demonic symbols on it
__label__0 Keep your religious bulls*** to yourself. no one wants to friggin hear it,  they want a spray paint app  not to hunt down the devil.
__label__0 its dumb the wall looks more real than the paint does. don't get this app take my word for it. always read the reviews before u download an app even if it looks like a good app. if u have this app delete it!!!!!!! NOW!!!!!!!!! seriously delete it it suck
__label__0 Sounds great, but won't work. After reading the other reviews I decided to try it anyway, but it crashed my phone and I had to remove the battery. I uninstalled it and encourage you not to waste your time. Too dang bad though, wish it worked.
__label__0 If there was a half star, I would use it. This app would be 5 stars IF it would work. But it continues to crash. I never know when it will work and when it won't. Glad it was free.
__label__0 This app just would not load. Even after trying several times, and also turning on/off my phone.  So, I un-installed it and got another one that did.
__label__0 it sucks, took forever to download and never did actually download the main page just had to delete it , not good at all
__label__1 This beats the included browser with my Mach Speec Trio. It operates in full and mini modes and is faster.
__label__1 I used the native browser my Viewsonic gtablet came with, Dolphin and Opera Mini.  Opera is my favorite.  It is fast and easy to use.
__label__1 I love this internet browser for many reasons. It's fast, smooth, and user friendly. I really appreciate the inclusion of the &#34;turbo&#34; function. I find this most helpful due to my poor internet speeds. I can definitely see improvements in page loa
__label__1 This is actually a lot better, in my opinion, than Firefox or dolphin browser. Easy to use and lightning fast it's only flaw is the interaction with icloud. If you are fighting your current browser give this a try it is definitely worth a try.
__label__1 i really love this app amazeing app it works amazeing on my tablet it browser fast an show amazeing pics just amazeing an u can download on the app an do all kind of stuff on it
__label__1 THIS IS THE BROWSER YOU WANT AND NEED TO HAVE. FASTER THAN DOLPHIN AND THE STOCK ANDRIOD BROWSER. GREAT START PAGES AND EASY BOOKMARKING MAKES GETTING TO YOU SITES FAST AND EASY.ITS THE ONLY BROWSER I USE NOW.  10 TIMES FASTER THAN DOLPHIN.  TAKES SECOND
__label__1 Great browser featuring Opera link (sync bookmarks, searches, speeddial, passwords in the future).  Turbo option increases speed by compressing pages.
__label__0 Regrettably Opera, my fave browser, would not function properly on my Ainol Novo 7 tablet with Android 4.01 (Ice Cream Sandwich). They are ahead of the curve among browsers, give them time. I like the feature richness of the Opera I have on my Desktop.
__label__1 Several months ago I side loaded Opera Mobile from my phone onto the Kindle Fire. I like it more than the built-in Silk browser. It seems much faster, and I like the way that tabs work on Opera Mobile better. Plus I'm using Opera Link so that my bookmark
__label__1 I used Opera on my PC. I tried Opera Mini. I ran for about a week. Then It stopped working, App not installed? No big Red O, just a small green bot? Why?  I came back to install Opera Mini, but I can't install the Opera Mini app? Why, not on Amazon apps?
__label__0 Amazon says it is not compatible with the Kindle Fire HD, other sites say it works, Amazon said it downloaded and it didn't. The price was right.
__label__1 Having tried the core browser on my Samsung Galaxy S 4G froyo, Dolphin, and Opera, the Opera wins hands down.  Lots of tabs (9 or 10) speed &quot;dial&quot; faves, double tap to zoom, which is customizable, no dots or pixels, selecting text to copy and p
__label__1 Have had Opera on my computer now for around two years...Find safe and efficient and much better than a lot of other browsers.
__label__0 The Amazon app store is about the same as the Google marketplace when it comes to K Fire apps.  I was looking for an alternate browser to Silk.  I am perfectly fine with the browser, except that it doesn't consistently load web pages that I need to acces
__label__0 Will not work on kindle fire Amazon has made a huge mistake not having flash player for the 8.9 hd kindle & not allowing to use web browsers that support it. When so many games & websites use it. Can't use it on kindle fire this is why 1 star. It was jus
__label__1 This is my go to browser on my android x and on my pc.  I have always loved Opera. It is small agile and fun.  It works as advertised every time I open it up. I don't know what appears you naysayers are reviewing but it clearly is not this one.
__label__0 Hey All,Just a quick note of a product that will not install on a Velocity Micro running Android ver. 2.2.1Cheers!Dave Cooke
__label__1 I hated browsing the web on my cheapo tablet, but opera works great. It feels almost as fast as any other computer in the house. I was really shocked how much faster it is.
__label__1 My tablet had a generic browser, and the amazon appstore, so Google Chrome was not available. I Found this browser and it is as good a Google Chrome if not better.
__label__1 Love it. Works much faster then the factory browser that's on my tablet. Easy to use and not at all complicated. I used Opera browser on my computer and it was okay, but the android is great. Comes highly recommended.
__label__0 Before you pay for it, make sure your device is supported. The download site said it was compatible, so I bought it. It would not download. After several emails, support said not all android 4.0 devices were supported and mine was one of the not supporte
__label__1 easy to use, quick a must for any tablet sets up easy for pages with preview Best browser I have found so far
__label__1 It's noticeably faster than the android browser, and, more importantly, opera has a more intuitive UI, with a great start up page (that can sync with your pc, if you want) and web page tabs that are immediatly available to preview, switch to or close a t
__label__0 I called my bank because I couldn't get my bank statement to pull up. They suggested downloading Opera Mobile Web Browser. After I downloaded it, my computer shut down.  I uninstalled it and my computer works fine. It just wasn't compatible with my lapto
__label__0 I used this browser for months until I was talked into trying Dolphin. WOW! What I had been missing was astonishing! DO NOT USE OPERA OR THE OTHERS! You only need Dolphin.
__label__0 On my Samsung Tab 3, it was 10x slower than either Google Chrome or my stock browser.  No exaggeration.  Not sure what the deal was, tried it with the Turbo feature on and off, but the window loads were so slow here on Amazon (my main site) that I uninst
__label__1 I thought Maxthon was the best Browser on the Kindle Fire. Until I side loaded Opera Mobile and now it's my favorite Browser and the best on Kindle Fire, for many reasons.
__label__1 I've been away from using Opera for some time now. I remember it was great for my old Windows Phone. It still looks and functions perfectly, but it takes a bit of &#34;getting used to&#34; after using other browsers for a few years.
__label__0 Downloaded it, tried to contact it to Facebook and get friends birthdays. Some kind of error message about some unexpected hash mark popped up and it did nothing...might try erasing and reloading but probably not worth it.
__label__0 I chose this rating because it's the closest I can get to zero and still say this app sucks on Kindle Fire HD.
__label__0 I have a kindle fire and I could not get it to work with my contacts list. I tried but I just couldn't figure it out.
__label__0 This just didn't work at all on my kindle fire.  Nothing on the screen.  No place to enter anything. I didn't use it at all because there was nothing to try.
__label__0 This app is ok, i guess. What am i saying?! This app sucks butt!!!!!!! Don't get!!!!!!!! I do like the pic thoughon the cover! Mmmmmmmm, cake sounds good.
__label__1 I love this app!It keeps me organized and even notifies me when a birthday comes up.You can even sync your kindle contacts onto there or just make a new contact!Very user-friendly.I would recommend this to anybody!
__label__0 I was hoping for an app to sync with FB, but this one wouldn't do ANYTHING, I mean nothing. I know it's free, but why waste our time if it is just gonna sit there? Sorry, if I could give it minus points, I would.  This all pertains to a Kindle Fire.
__label__1 Was looking for a App that would keep track of my accounts. I'm cheap and like the word FREE, that is why I downloaded this app first.  I think I got more then I thought I would for free. I want to upgrade to the Pro when money is available so I can see

__label__1 This app is amazing, ideal &amp; in short, spectacular. I can't believe it doesn't cost $15. This lite version is free, so at some point I'll be seeking to make a donation or two soon as can. Thank you for this excellent personal accounting app. I even a
__label__0 Poor user interface. I was completely confused. I would rather use excel because I don't have the time to be learning how to use all the poorly explained and organized buttons.
__label__0 I found a better app that doesn't keep kicking me out when I get to it. Deleted from all devices.
__label__1 all I wanted was an app to keep track of my daily checkbook balance. this is the 3rd one I tried, and the first one that actually works with kindle fire. I only use the checkbook register but there are many other financial tools included. I love this app
__label__1 WAS VERY HELPFUL IN SHOWING ME WHAT I WAS GETTING AND NEEDED.  I BOUGHT THE FULL VERSION AND LOVE IT.  IT HAS REALLY HELPED ME UNDERSTAND MY FINANCES MUCH BETTER.
__label__0 Too hard to get set up. A little confusing, too. Probably would work okay if it was easier to get up and running.
__label__1 This app is perfect for keeping track of finances for my business. I recommend it. No problems or issues thus far.
__label__1 I use this everyday, it has some glices which the updates are slowly correcting but I have't found a similar product that is as good - yet
__label__0 This app required heavy payment for use, and the free app didn't indicate anything about payment for full use of features.
__label__1 I only use the calendar so far, but it's still great. It links up with your google calendars, which is why I got it since my kindle calendar stop syncing with my google calendars.
__label__1 great price (FREE) and a great way for me to carry around a calendar and address book in one (since I *don't* have a cell phone!)  IF you have a smartphone, this may not be worth it for you.
__label__1 I use it many times throughout the day to keep track of contacts, appointments and tasks.  It can be a tad finicky when editing sometimes - could be me - but I really depend on it and highly recommend it.
__label__1 It's a Kindle/Android version of MSOutlook. I no longer have to carry around an agenda. Easy to use &amp; automatically syncs my contacts. A must have for anyone who needs an organizer!
__label__1 I have used Microsoft outlook for years and when I started using mobile devices I wanted the same.interface. My first device was a Blackberry provided by my employer, and syncing with Outlook on the company server was seamless.  I left that company and p
__label__1 Really enjoy this office organizer.  It has the calendar & phone contact that I really like.  It's so easy to use & keeps me organized.
__label__1 I love it on my kindle fire.Very easy to use. You will not be sorry...... I run my calender and my address book thru it.
__label__0 Haven't worked with this site yet so I can't give a solid review. I'm sure I will enjoy it when I get to work with it.
__label__1 This app. has everything you need to organize your life.  I have used a Franklin Covey day planner for years and years and this app has replaced it.
__label__1 I was looking for this kind of app for my kindle fire and i am so happy to have found it! Only problem i see is that if your kindle crashes ( mine did and lost everything!) there is no way to get it back and it took me days to put all the info on it! If 
__label__1 If you are a former Palm user, this is the app you've been looking for.  If you're not a former Palm user, you still need this app.  It is absolutely the best sync app for Outlook to the Kindle Fire that I have ever seen.  The app on the Kindle Fire is f
__label__0 I didn't like this very much. This just did not work for me. There are so many more options out there that work better.
__label__0 Not worth the download. There are plenty of apps that can deliver better than this one can, especially for my Kindle Fire. Happy hunting!
__label__1 This free app has everything you need for scheduling, contacts, etc. It's like a data bank for your tablet! Did I mention it's free? Has a great calendar too.
__label__1 This is such a gift to be able to sync my calendar between my Kindle Fire and my computer. This is definitely what you need, unless you do not do much all day. The calender and the to-do list features are alone worthy of this download.
__label__1 I just discovered this app a little over a week ago when I was looking for a way to syncAct! Pro v16 (2014)- Includes 1 hour ACT! 101 training webinar held weeklywith my Kindle Fire HD. I also downloaded Deja Office for my iPhone and iPad to sync that wi

__label__1 This was the last piece of the puzzle needed to ditch my trusty Palm after 10 yrs. Everything transferred seamlessly.Loving it so far.
__label__1 I use the (along with companion link) to keep my android and outlook on my computer in sync.  Would highly recommend to anyone who needs to have their outlook data with them at all times.
__label__1 I love this product! It allows me to use the reminder and the snooze reminder. I like that it shows day, week, month or year. Another benefit is that it's easy to navigate. I don't like that it doesn't sync with my yahoo calendar easily. Other than that,
__label__0 You have to allow twenty different permissions in order to download this app. That is way too many. The app might work well, but I do not want anyone having all that access to all those different things. This app is not worth someone knowing all these th
__label__1 Great app - solved a number of sync/act issues.  Recommended for anybody using act and a Kindle Fire/Windows phone.  Very helpful.
__label__1 Had looked for any and all apps to sync my new ASUS 300Tpad with outlook and couldn't find any.  Was even more disappointed to read that there were minimal apps but was lucky that the article talked about CompanionLink.  I was even more thrilled to learn
__label__1 Only took a second to figure out menu and submenu navigation.  Has all the effects I could want and then some. Well be my goto photo editor from now on. Good job on this one.

__label__1 this is my personal fave. I use it so so much. I always get great comments about the pics I post after I've fixed them with little photo.... love it!
__label__1 Wonderful very nice and easy to use application.  I have been a Priority member for many years now I have all the information I need at my finger tips.
__label__1 So glad to have this mobile app and it works great! I'm already using it to earn more and more points with IHG!
__label__1 use it often and it is very convenient.  highly recommended.  the app works flawlessly. can't say enough good things about Priority Club Rewards.
__label__1 Always stay where IHG gives points to use.
__label__0 Would be a great game if you could play it. Want play all the way through WASTE of money. Will not be buying from this Game Company Again.
__label__1 this game is one of the better ho games. played on my fire with not one bit of trouble. great story line. really enjoyed this.
__label__0 I have a kindle fire, the hidden object portion was awesome. But when it came to the minigames my screen was all messed up, I read similar complaints, and its true. Would love to purchase the whole game, but am afraid of the same problem. I dont know if 
__label__1 Very fun! This app works flawlessly on my Motorola Triumph (Android 2.2)\nAlso, yes, its a ripoff of Tux Racer, but unlile Tux, it isn&apos;t a ripoff on your wallet. \nAlso, you can control his speed, you flick forwards &amp; backwards to do that.
__label__0 Crashed on me on multiple tracks, when it did run and too easy to get turned around in a rut.
__label__0 I guess it's an OK premise but the practice is just you playing the game  no tutorial  no explanation  waste of time
__label__0 Total junk. Doesn&apos;t even work on the G-Tab, absolutely no control. Don&apos;t waste your time or memory getting this game.
__label__1 I dont get how people dont like this game! Its so fun! I love how its n 3d, my favorite challenge is ski jump, feels like ur flying... ;)
__label__1 I downloaded this game because I loved the graphic, but then I started playing it! This game is a lot of fun! Not overly challenging, doesn't take a lot of brain cells to figure it out, its just a fun time waster. Use your phone to control the speed and 
__label__1 I&apos;m really enjoying this game. Graphics are pretty good and it can be challenging. No issues at all on my Evo 3D. I don&apos;t know why everyone is dogging this app!? Good graphics, fun, free, challenging... what&apos;s not to like?
__label__0 This is nothing but the open source game TuxRider/TuxRacer with the Preferences and About menus removed... and of course, the new developer's ad/button in place. If you want the real thing, TuxRider is available for free in the Market and its developer m
__label__0 Might as well play this on Linux, because on the phone sucks. I hate it when people change the name and such and call it theirs.
__label__1 I really love the first person mode.  It reminds me of downhill skiing, which I can't do in July! Fun game.
__label__1 I accidentally discovered that the Amazon version is the March '11 release as opposed to the Market version.  The market wanted to update it, but kept failing.  Finally realized I had gotten the Amzon one.  Have no clue why thse Market would know/want to
__label__1 This app saved me a couple of times when I did not have the ability to use USB.  Be aware that Android and windows don't like transferring some files with some file extensions.  I had to rename .exe and .apk files before transferring.
__label__1 I found this app shortly after I got my first Android phone almost a year ago.Banzai! I was thrilled. You will be too. It is so handy to be able to trade ringtones and pics or any other file on your sd card *or* phone with anyone one else that has the ri

__label__1 These are very beatuiful and relaxing to watch. Makes you wish you were right there with it. Try it you will love it too.
__label__0 This wall paper is terrible.  It looks decent in the icon, but when it gets blown up to the size of your phone screen, the quality is absolutely terrible. The &#34;live&#34; water doesn't look like running water at all.
__label__1 One of the most exciting apps to me is living wallpaper. I have and always will be a fan of things that move on my phone, tablet, desktop and laptop.
__label__1 I've tried a lot of WW apps over the years but this one is the best by far!  It's extremely user friendly and intuitive, has a large database of foods, especially WW friendly foods (it updated just a few minutes ago when I logged on to it) -- it's up to 
__label__1 Keeps track of food, your weight and measurements, all without having to connectto ww. Great online food database. Well worth the price.
__label__1 This is easy to use and fun too.  So much cheaper than the online WW program.  Runs perfect on my Fire with no problems.
__label__1 Great app to track your points. Has more features than the stock weight watchers app without the monthly cost. I would recommend this to anyone looking to lose weight. Helps keep you honest.
__label__1 I'm extremely overweight and this helps me to keep track with ease and it lets you see what you've already logged. you can eat anything and keep on losing weight. I lost 8.2 pounds this week.
__label__1 I wanted to do the points plus but live too far from meetings.  I was looking at apps for my Kindle Fire and found this one.  I tried it and am hooked.  So easy to use, has everything I need to follow points plus, and even calculates my daily points valu

__label__1 I like this app a lot well worth the money. helps me to stay on track with out going to meetings.
__label__1 Its nice to have an app that calculates &amp; keeps track of my food. Looking it up myself was tedious. This app makes it easy. I love it!
__label__1 Best Weight Watchers app ever.. no other app is needed. It calculates, there's a database, place for notes.. it tracks everything you need and more!
__label__1 This diary is really great. I lost 9 pounds in the last two and a half weeks. I would really recommend it for guys and girls that can't live without their gadgets. My eating habits are changing everyday.

__label__1 As others have posted, this app is much better than the &amp;#34;official&amp;#34; Weight Watchers app or website on my Fire (2nd generation). Intuitive and easy to use. A very complete database of foods and loads of restaurants. I tried this app a coupl
__label__1 This tool works really well and is free. What more could you ask for. Simple interface the ability to scan barcodes and enter manually are all great.
__label__1 This is agreat app and they keep it updated as nessasary i put this in my favorites and i am loosing weight weekly. i am using the &quot; Booster &quot; in the calculate points section. This is worth the money and time.... Number one Program...
__label__1 I have tried the regular WW app, but prefer this one. With the WW app, you need Internet to access it--something I don't always have. I like that I am able to access this app both on and off-line. My only criticism is that you have to enter whole numbers
__label__1 I used the WW website for a few months and loved my results. My problem was that I do all of my tracking on my Kindle Fire, and for whatever reason, their site is incredibly difficult to even access, much less use via Fires. I found myself looking for ap
__label__1 Finally a program for meal tracking that does not take the whole time you are preparing the food to enter into your journal! (and then your dinner gets cold because you are still entering!)  My only fault is that it will read barcodes for manual entry bu
__label__1 At first I was hesitant to get this application, but glad I did. Easy to use, has more information storage for you to go back and look at. Helps in figuring out your points, lets you see what you have eaten all day, and you can have it set so that it dup
__label__1 I prefer this app to the. one WW had at the time.  Perhaps it has been improved. This app has everything I want to record points weight measurements etc. si have never had a problem with it. Highly recommend.
__label__1 I have been using this ap for two weeks. it gives me the information and support to stay on track.  makes it a lot of fun and I love the grapnel showing my weight loss
__label__1 Really appreciate this app.  I'm not an active WW member , but like this method of tracking better than calorie counting.  Thank you!
__label__1 Best weight app. on the market in my opinion. If you cant afford weight watchers site this is the next best thing. I use it every day.
__label__1 Just as good as the ww app.  Essential for anyone who wants to continue the program tracking of food.  Has all the needed functionality.
__label__1 I have been using this app for a couple of years now and it just keeps getting better. My wife subscribes to Weight Watchers Online and I just use this app. There are some differences, but this is an awesome resource for anyone following a WW type plan. 
__label__1 This app is wonderful. It has a large library of items so you don't have to put in all the data and it does not freeze up the phone or have any other glitches.
__label__1 Love this app. Started using it on my Kindle Fire and put it on my cell phone when I switched to Android from Blackberry. Love it on the Kindle,  easier to read. However bar code scanner is a nice feature on the phone. Lost 20 lbs. tracking with this app
__label__1 so easy to use. since I carry my fire with me I can keep track of everything and can see a difference in my weight. It helps me stay in control! Have already recommend to several friends.
__label__1 I love this app.It was well worth the money. Its easy to use.I have lost 6 pounds sense I started. would recommend if trying to lose weight.
__label__1 Just started going to weight watchers and was horrified dealing with tracking and points--until I discovered this app.  Thank you Fenlander Software!  I'm paying for the use of the Weight Watcher site but the site doesn't run on my Kindle Fire so I gave 
__label__1 I really like using this app.  It helps keep "track" of the point values of the food I eat.  Helps:  diary, favs. your foods, really helpful database of foods, there is a way to help track exercise "points.  Until I see something better this the one.  Th
__label__1 love it! no complaints, easy to use which is a huge plus. very accurate. love that I can look up restaurants
__label__1 have been on ww several times and tracking food was such a chore that I didn't do it. now w this apparently its Sooooo ez and I track every single morsel! ! thanks so much!!!
__label__1 Full of neat and useful features! Very user friendly, too! I highly recommend this app. I've had the flu so I haven't been following much of a diet or exercise regimen, but looking forward to getting back on track and using this as a helpful tool.
__label__1 I love this app.  It's the easiest, least expensive way to do Weight Watchers EVER!  I live in a small town and knew there was no way I would go to in person meetings (I'd know everyone there).  The online option seemed to expensive (and then I started s
__label__0 Don't waste your time. The app is buggy and fugly. It does not belong on your phone. One has to wonder whether the developer even looked at the free competition before setting his price.Absolutely not recommended. Not even for free. Not even if Amazon pa
__label__0 this app is ridiculously complicated to use, considering its just supposed to be a task list. you waste a lot of time adding tasks. this might be good for procastinators though if they dont actually want to complete the tasks... but even they should be w
__label__0 would not recommend this what so ever to anyone. not even free. the developer should pay me to use this app. its that bad. a pile of cow dung.
__label__0 Wow Amazon did it again! Another worthless crapp of the day!  I wonder what they will give us free next that no one will use....
__label__0 Downloaded when it was a free app.  First thing I notice? Add new item button is the  width of the + symbol and not prominent. Also requires too much permission, especially given that the default task is 'financial'.  There is better to be had for free.
__label__0 This appis horriable, how can they make an app thats so ugly and that is just like theone on my phone. I would never pay for this, i dont know if it is a good thing or not that it is free today.
__label__0 Really ugly looking app. It works okay but there are much better alternatives for free. You'll notice that this app is pretty much rated five stars or one star which means the developer is writing a lot of fake over hyped reviews. Pathetic. Don't even do
__label__0 This app cured my acne and made my phone faster. 5 min after I downloaded this app I inherited a million dollars. Also now women flock to me and men envy me. All because of this little amazing app!
__label__0 This is one of the worst programs available on the free app of the day.  horrible UI and broken program.  really 4 dollars the dev allowed free app of the day to be high on the list.  trust the 1 star ratings.
__label__0 Poor interface, no instructions. I'd love to know how the 5 star reviewers figured out how to make this app so essential.
__label__0 This app is so so so bad!The best part of the app is the icon - I do not know who would pay for this in their right mind. Almost any free notepad app is better than this one.
__label__0 Got it for free and still installed. ugly UI.  To be honest who really needs a task list?  If I did need one I certainly wouldn't pay $4 for it.
__label__0 there are much better apps of this type available for free much less 4 dollars.  terrible interface and barely functional.  if your reading this and its not free.  Run!!
__label__0 no backup option, nor does it sync with any online task manager - such as Google Tasks.  Instructions do not do as the title mught suggest.
__label__1 The negative reviews nearly scared me away from trying this program, but I am glad I gave it a shot. The quadrant system is a great idea. I suspect the negative reviews come from people who didn't take the time to learn about how to use the Forward, Neut
__label__0 I had to add my 1 star to this app. Maybe the developer will take a hint, and charge a reasonable price for such a simple app. Like FREE!
__label__0 Not only is this an amazing app.  I think the best feature is the quad-whats.  And it knew how I like my coffee! Just amazing. My friend says it took years off her complexion. I would make 3 easy payments!!
__label__0 What a horribly designed app! It loses entries, force closes,  and is an embarassment to Amazon. How does garbage like this get approved for Droid?
__label__0 Okay you know the five star reviews have to be fake.  there is no possible way anyone in their right mind could honestly give it anything over two. you can just tell looking at the screen shots how crappy the app will be before you download it. try it fo
__label__0 The UI is unintuitive and gets in your way. This app tries to be Remember the Milk and Evernote smashed together, and the result is pure, unadulterated fail. Even at $0.00, this app is too expensive.
__label__0 The few 5 star reviews must be from the developer cause this app is a rip off. I'm glad I didn't pay for this it's complete crap and will be uninstalled after typing this review. Amazon should use an app before placing it on the paid for free area. This 
__label__0 Wow, can't believe they are charging $4 for this piece of crap to do list. It's extremely ugly, bad design. And that's really just the tip of the iceberg. Doesn't even work well. The quadrant view could be cool, if it did a decent job of taking and displ
__label__0 This app should be removed, and the developers ought to be blacklisted. Not only is it priced too high. Not only is the interface poorly constructed. The main issue is that the developers dishonestly reviewed and rated their own product. Not cool.
__label__0 I see absolutely no purpose for this app. Don't buy it. It's not even worth the space it took up in my phone the day it was free on the appstore. The interface is chunky and confusing, there are free apps that work better than this. DONT PURCHASE.
__label__0 I can not for the life of me determine what use this application has.  A text editor keeps tasks better.  Twenty words
__label__1 This app worked all right for me.  It has a lot of customization and great options.  I'm not the type who usually uses a task manager, but since it was free I gave it a go.  I got it and used it all day.  No problems.  The interface could use better expl
__label__0 poor ui.  poor functionality.  poor everything.  amazon made a poor decision releasing this for free.  gtasks is so muvh better..
__label__0 I am having a hard time believing anyone actually paying 4 bucks for this, and if you are the one....shame on you.
__label__0 This app seems to complete it's task ok.  But the GUI is just plain terrible, not customizeable except for a limited selection of colors.  The interface also seems like it was  designed with a single phone in mind... The app will not resize to fit the re
__label__0 If I could rate 1/2 star is would.  Very Poor design and UI. Loses tasks,  looking at when the 5 star reviews were done it's obvious the developer and his or her friends rated their own product.  All the high ratings are within a week of eachother and th
__label__0 Confusing UI aside, the program won't save my tasks, and doesn't do anything for me other than work as a glorified notepad application. Something like Astrid or even a calendar event on google calendar can do more on my phone.Honrstly, this program needs
__label__0 Yes, this is definitely a bad app. I wonder how did Amazon approve it to be the free app if the day.Now a problem: I tried to uninstall the app, but got the message that uninstall was unsuccessful. The app does not show at the app drawer, butI I guess pa
__label__1 I have had this app a long time it real helps big time it is the best game of disshion
__label__0 Roses are red. Violets are blue. This app sucks, you know its true.(Bows) thank you. thank you.  Encore? Ok. Check out if I have been on another app to find my poems. Hmm... I feel in the mood for a game... perhaps a virtual toilet? maybe just a virtual 
__label__1 Awesome
__label__1 I really like this calculator.  I use it often.  When I purchased a new phone, purchasing this App was number one on my list of things to do.
__label__1 Don't use an awfully lot, but when I need it, it sure helps. I always wanted a percent calculator because when your in the store and it says 20% off of 6.99 well what does that come out to? so this is a must for us who shop bargains lol
__label__1 Great bible, I got it because i use it on my phone. The phone version however does offer more translation than this, go figure.I love studying the word & this bible is the best there is out there without any invasion whatsoever. If u have an android phon
__label__1 I got this Bible for my husband to use when I am teaching Sunday School.  It is easier for him to use. No gadgets like some of the others. Plus he is more comfortable with this version.
__label__1 Having downloaded several versions of the Bible I have become addicted to this one. It's easy to navigate, notes and highlighting features are easy and reliable. I use it for personal study time along with the Bible trivia game (free at app store) and fo
__label__1 Very easy 2 use, easy 2 find a specific verse. Of all the bible apps on Amazon's Appstore this is the one I would recommend
__label__1 This is easy to use fast reference I really enjoy it so  fun to read and don't have to lick your fingers to turn a page.
__label__1 I would only encourage people to read the Bible is all I have to say on the matter at hand
__label__1 It does what is says, quick. You can quickly find a verse and turn to it. I love that you can add different Bible versions. I mainly use the KJV, but have Bible in Basic English when trying to understand a difficult verse. I like that in is not an 80 meg
__label__1 I have been searching for that "perfect" Bible app, and I do believe I have found it.  This is a very customizable app with many functions and requires very little space.  It can be used off line.  I have left the app open for a while to see if I got the
__label__1 Great for my Kindle and I am enjoying this.  Great gift for anyone and I have always liked the KJV myself.
__label__1 I like the fast reference when I type in the book and verse.  It is very good.  I would recommend everyone purchase this that would like a fast reference.
__label__1 I really liked this app...really do! but, I downloaded this app and another at the same time and I just liked the other app better and so I use that one!  So sorry to have done that cause I do like this app and I would recommend both to everyone and let 
__label__1 I would have given this a 10 or more, as what could be better than the Word of GOD to have with you, when you need it. These crazy days we need the 'Word' and stay close to the Lord our GOD.
__label__1 Quick King James Bible (KJV) is great. I take my tablet with me everywhere and it's great to have on hand.
__label__1 I RECOMEND THIS BIBLE FOR NOTE BOOKS AND KINDLES . FOR IT IS THE TRUEST , PUREST , MOST DOWN TO EARTH KING JAMES BIBLE, I LOVE IT , OUR PREACHER'S WIFE SHOW'D THIS TO US TO DOWNLOAD ONTO THE KINDLE FOR CHURCH, IT IS THE TRUEST BIBLE , HAS ALL OF GOD'S WO
__label__1 I found this app to be reliable and you don't have to be on wi-fi to use it.  My mother loves this app and she's 83 years old.
__label__1 Installed as a free KJV on my Kindle. Great app & all for free. Christ words in red & easy surfing from book to book
__label__1 This is the best Bible App! It's quick, efficient and easy to use. The search option is great also. Every verse or word I have searched, it has found. A must have!
__label__1 easy to navigate, easy to read, you can find tons of reading cycles online for free if you want 2 read thru it in a year, just pik the one that works for you.  Can now take my Bible anywhere which is convenient.  Also this was a free app, nice to have a 
__label__1 this KJV Bible by far is one of the best bibles I used it quick and easy way to chose books, chapter, and verse is great its always at the bottom of page the only thing I would like to see change is being able to move left to right instead of up and down
__label__1 Over the years I have used many types of E-Bibles, from software, to dedicated devices, and now this Android app. This is by far the easiest and most versatile type I have ever used. Its easy to get to where you want, its fast, clear and easy to read, it
__label__1 this is a very nice Bible program. loads quickly, runs flawlessly, gives me the options i want (text size, colors, etc), along with bookmarks and the ability to add verse notes. exactly what i was looking for to use for my daily Bible reading.
__label__1 I love this app it is so easy to read God's holy word. I keep my tablet with me most of the time and when I stop reading it comes back to where I left off. I thank God for such great tools to work with. It makes it so easy to read God's Word.
__label__1 Great App which meets daily use. It has a daily verse and search by chapter, verse, or subject. I'd been searching for a passage for months before installing this app. With the easy search, I found it. Highly recommend
__label__1 Easy to use, Easy to read, and has just what I need to do my morning devotions. Now I can read the Bible when I am out and about without messsing up the pages.
__label__1 Its all good. I love the Lord and his written book. I'm so glad that it was offered for the kindle fire.
__label__1 better than any book I have downloaded. highly recommend, easy to use. I use mine in church every Sunday. Works fast and you don't need Internet.
__label__1 As always I enjoy reading God,s love for us. This is the never-ending story.  For me it is the finest Words ever written.
__label__1 The quick Bible is awesome, I can access it from anywhere. The  best part I do not need the Internet to access it. Bravo!!!
__label__1 A simple to use, but highly useful app.  Switch between books, bookmarks and highlight with ease.  The Bible at my fingertips, without needing a wifi connection.
__label__1 i love it because it easy to use to find the book i want.i got it because it very useful to highlight important scripturesno dislike when come to God's wordjust love this app
__label__1 This is an easy to read Bible. I got it because I have a problem reading the small print in my Bible and this is wonderful. I also love it because it can go anywhere with you easily.I would definitely recommend this app.
__label__1 Nice to be able to pick up phone or tablet no matter where you are and be able to read the Bible, Easy read,I have enjoyed it
__label__1 This is why this version of the bible is great for me. The versions available are interesting to see the differences as a person looks up chapters/verses on the fly. A person can shift back and forth between various versions.
__label__1 This is a great app for church or home. Easy to use and mark verses. I really like it. I would  recomend it !
__label__1 I like that you are able to move from book to book easily.  At church we move to different parts of the Bible and searching through a book is difficult to keep up with the sermon.
__label__1 I love this quick KJV Bible. It's so easy to find what book and verse.You can take it with you to church or anywhere.I would recommend it to anyone. Myself I only use the KJV. It's great.
__label__1 it was everything the reviews said it would be. i enjoy being able to highlight and make notes on any verse i want to.
__label__1 THIS ITEM GIVES EXACTLY WHAT IT SAYS IT WILL DO.  IT EALLY IS QUICK AND IT JUST WHAT I NEEDED FOR MYCELL PHONE.
__label__1 I cannot carry my Bible with me everywhere I go, but, my Kindle Fire is always with me...love the convienience.....
__label__1 i think this is splendid to put the whole bible on an app. Now people have no reason to read it
__label__1 Simply a very good Bible so very easy to search and use.  Customizable fonts and colors.Thank you Author for such a wonderful Bible.God bless you!I changed the font to black and background to white. Seems more cheerful  to me.I realize it uses more batte
__label__1 I love reading the Bible on my Kindle. It is easy to read and to transport it. I Love it!
__label__1 I LOVE this, I even love it more that I can add notes as the pastor talks. This is much easier than the actual book and taking notes.
__label__1 I found this version easy to get around in. It is quick and easy. I have two kids. (7 & 10) They both can surf from book to book during the sermons. It did not take me long at all to get used to the way it changes books and verses. There are options to h
__label__1 Great to carry to church or Bible Study.  Easy to locate references or jump from verse to verse.  I've used other KJV apps and this is the easiest FREE one I've found so far.
__label__1 I've been looking for a Bible App like this for YEARS!!! THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU!!!!!! Not that I didn't know when Jesus was speaking, but it's nice to have some concrete certainty.
__label__1 Easy to use.  I really enjoy using this in bible class and during study at home.  Good for devotionals also.
__label__1 Great keyboard. Easy to use and great auto correction. I can type faster now than ever before. The skins are a nice touch. :-)
__label__0 wont apply any settings or even apply period, dont waste your time. shame because i use my tablet keyboard a lot
__label__1 This is a great keyboard for any task...better than the pre-installed android one. I'm using it to type this review right now. The predictive assistance is excellent too!!
__label__1 I'm currently using it to write this review.  It took awhile to learn &amp; I even disabled for awhile, but after working with it more, I seem to be getting on its level.  :-)  It isn't completely compatible,for example with OfficeSuite I have to backspa
__label__1 I tired other keyboards, but this one seems to work better than the SwiftKeys with my PanDigital 7&#34; tablet. Thumbs up.
__label__0 Spell check is terrible, keyboard functions are terrible. I couldn't find one good thing about this app. . . .
__label__0 2.99 for this.  why dont they just make a app with dancing monkeys on the screen and tell people they would like our money for mt dew and Doritos. i would be more inclined to buy it based on that than this out dated crap.
__label__0 Absolutely waste.. Don&apos;t use this app for your phone. It will drain your battery. Android has better memory management in its system.
__label__0 Although I must say I love the fake reviews, haha. Maybe I&apos;m just another &quot;Droid troll&quot;, but the bottom line? SAY NOOOOOOOOOO TO TASK KILLERS. The end.
__label__0 Amazon should know better than to put their support behind this charleton of an application by featuring it as Free App of the Day. Every potential visitor to this page should understand that this type of application is a complete waste of time (and mone
__label__0 Android 2.0 and newer don&apos;t need this, and this app will cut your battery life if you run it on Android 2.0 or higher.
__label__0 Android phones operate using flash memory. Because there is no hard disk drive, a defragmentation is impossible.\n\nThis leads me to question the legitimacy of the app, as the creators would have no way of writing an actual defrag program. I&apos;ve hear
__label__0 Another points task killer... Specifically designed to slow your Android phone down and eat even more battery life than without it. When will developers stop making these? And this one charges money!
__label__0 Apps like this are no longer need on  newer phones. if you have an older one it might help bit check what  version of android you have by going into setting &gt; about phone  if  you have 2.0 or higher pass on this app.\n
__label__0 as everbody are becoming aware that all app killers, task killers, memory boosters etc are useless as android will reload the app immediately after,and for doing this app, you are killing your battery for reloading apps constantly. get rid ofall those, a
__label__0 bleh Amazon...u know better! As for the developers, why would you prey upon those who don&apos;t understand 2.0 android software?
__label__0 defragging solid state memory is a bad thing.  secondly, the android OS does not need a task killer and force closing apps with them can cause your phone to start having issues.
__label__0 Didn&apos;t do anything to make my phone better.  Waste of time and space.  Not recommended.  Do yourself a favor and don&apos;t bother downloading.
__label__0 don&apos;t waste your time downloading these types of apps.  as all the other review s said,t total waste of time
__label__0 Do not download this. your android software, ir 2.0 ir above, does not need a task killer. RAM defrag is BS. This one star rating goes for the dev of this app and specially dor Amazon.
__label__0 Don't let these developers make any money off of this crappy work even if it doesn't cost you anything!  I am sure everyone else has covered the merit of these task killers.
__label__0 First, as already explained by many others Android versions 2+ comes with a very effective and efficient memory manager (allocation and garbage collection).  Having applications such as this running in the background will not only be a battery hog,  but 
__label__0 First off how do you drfrag memory? Answer is you can&apos;t it&apos;s not a hard drive. This app is useless crap DO NOT DOWNLOAD
__label__0 I couldn&apos;t notice a difference at all.  2.99 is a rip off.  I wouldn&apos;t recommend this at all . 20 words.
__label__0 If you really must get a task killer because some idiot in a suit at a cell phone store says so, then at least get a free one. True geeks and techs are trying to save you from making a mistake here, so pay attention, read up, and use google to educate yo
__label__0 I haven&apos;t seen any speed increase with these type of apps. In fact my phone seems to run more slowly.
__label__0 Just like everyone else is saying,  worthless application for anyone running 2.0 or higher. Defrag RAM, really? That is ridiculous.
__label__0 Memory defrager? That is a new for me, do your phone a favor and don&apos;t install this BS app. So i need a few more words... There!
__label__0 Most of the apps it killed were background apps that will restart themselves.  So you. Ot old waste battery power by running this app,  but you lose more to the program restarting. I see Amazon is scraping the bottom of the barrel today!
__label__0 No good for nothing. Useless,just another useless application. I&apos;m glad people do reviews like Android tells you read reviews to avoid useless apps like this one.
__label__1 Not everyone has a 2.0 or higher phone. So why all the 1 star reviews? Oh that&apos;s  right its all the people that think they are the only people on earth and believe even the sun revolves around them.  \n\nSo they say task killers are not needed after
__label__0 Pros: it looks nice?\nCons: it kills apps like games even when they&apos;re running, and caused my 4g radio to disable itself repetitively.\n\nMemory management by the OS may not be using a desired algorithm, which would constitute a potential need for p
__label__0 ram cannot be defragmented period,  this uses more battery and ram so it makes it useless, the os already does this job without wasting performance
__label__0 Report an issue with it in the product description section. That way Amazon will know what&apos;s going on too. And everyone is right. Apps like these are not needed.
__label__0 Reviews are helpful, good or bad, I dont install anything without reading at least 50 reviews on the app.
__label__0 Task killers are not needed on phones running the newer android operating systems. They handle this stuff on there own and task killers can do more harm then good to them
__label__0 Task killers nowdays are useless, and you (dev) are just pushing snake oil down everyone&apos;s throats thinking that you&apos;d win and hurt everyone with your junk? No thanks, and I&apos;m glad that everyone is down-rating this app! Shame that we can&a
__label__0 Task managers are pathetic and are based on the assumption that your phone doesn&apos;t know what it&apos;s doing. It does. Avoid like the plague. \n
__label__0 That doesn&apos;t even make sense. Memory is not the same as a hard drive, where defragging is useful. If that&apos;s what the devs claim... Wow.
__label__0 that phrase alone scares me.  defragging is a good thing on hard disk drives.  it realigns most used blocks farther on the platter to allow faster seeking. its a good thing.\n\ndefragging RAM or SSD (Solid state drive) is useless and DAMAGING.  there is 
__label__0 The Android operating system re-allocates memory on the fly as it&apos;s needed. Tasks that are idle may be &quot;using up&quot; your ram, but are unloaded automatically by the OS when that ram is called for. Using apps like this will force the OS to rel
__label__0 These type of applications are useless. No needed, doesn&apos;t do anything, waste of space and just a big zero. That&apos;s it.
__label__0 This app is a bad idea! I wish that Amazon would give us good apps as the daily free app but then again they are free so.... Anyway this app is not needed for the new Android phones. \n
__label__0 This app is not needed by most people. If you are still pre-froyo, give it a try. Otherwise, it&apos;s not needed and the developers should tell potential buyers this.  Bad business practice.
__label__0 This app is totally useless. You do not need it for your Android phone, no matter what scare tactic is used to convince you otherwise.
__label__0 This app store has really dropped the ball lately. I can&apos;t even remember the last time the FAotD was something good or useful! My phone came preloaded with an awesome task killer which is only used to &quot;kill&quot; apps if they happen to crash. T
__label__0 This is completely unnecessary and it will cause your battery to drain. Android manages resources, apps, and memory on it&apos;s own. Don&apos;t download this.
__label__0 This, like most other alleged &quot;performance&quot; enhancements for android, is absolute hokum. Unless you&apos;re changing the clock speeds of your cpu, or running a sleeker trimmed down UI you&apos;re not going to see a thing. If you need speed or b
__label__0 This must be some junk ported over from the iPhone market because an android phone doesn&apos;t need this crap. Seriously, I have over 100 apps on my phone and I don&apos;t have a single problem with it, my phone runs just fine without any additional mem
__label__0 To echo everyone else, these type of apps are useless.  maybe early on in the donut days they helped a little, but now the serve no purpose.
__label__0 useless and people should already know these task killers are really killing your phone. we aint trolls, we know so dont believe me? well google it. also your phone should already manage apps by itself. dont be idiots, just listen and understand.
__label__0 Usually the low ratings on Amazon aren't justified in this case, they are right. Apps like these are actually harmful to modern phones, im really surprised Amazon posted this. unless you are running an older phone with Android 2.1 or below, do not downlo
__label__0 What a waste this is. Its smoke and mirrors, and out set off Watch Dog. Its not needed and gets in the way of the native system...don&apos;t to it
__label__0 When I first got an android phone I went killing background apps left and right. This actually made the phone perform worse and be generally unstable.\n\nOnce I learned that android has a different method of memory management and left it alone my phone t
__label__0 why do programmers keep making these memory boosters? they don&apos;t work. if someone wants to help me , write a program that let&apos;s me remove the bloatware on my phone.
__label__0 Wouldn&apos;t touch this app with a 10 foot pole with the dev stating it defrags your phone.  What?  Defrag an android?
__label__0 You don&apos;t need this sort of thing with an Android device. Don&apos;t download this, we don&apos;t need to give this dev any money for a crap app.
__label__0 did nothing but make my phone battery die faster than it used to. don&apos;t waste your time downloading this app.
__label__0 Does no good on Android phones.  Maybe if you are stuck on 1.x version.  Useless otherwise. \n\nIf your phone is slow is more likely that you have poor hardware or crappy apps like this installed.
__label__0 everyone claims there are useless. I have the newest 4g phone available in the USA. and let me tell you my good task killer keeps force closes at a minimum and allows all my apps to run well. but this app sux it is horrible on all fronts. and for those s
__label__0 i havent download this apps... i didnt install any kinds for task killer... i dont need it..  i have use WatchDog Task Manager Pro...  i wasnt happy with that...  i learn alot about task killer from web site.... so, then i got updated new gingerbread 2.3
__label__0 It is called a smartphone for a reason. This App is not needed. Thanks but no thanks. Just use a regular task killer.
__label__0 The last time someone told me to defragment my RAM, they tried to sell me EDO sticks at 90 bucks a pop for 32 megs. I&apos;m not going to use the Android app being pushed under the same &quot;I have no idea what I&apos;m taking about&quot; computer sales
__label__0 This kind of application is no longer needed.  It&apos;s seems like Amazon doesn&apos;t understand this.  Why should I trust Amazon market if they don&apos;t understand themselves?
__label__0 well I downloaded this app this morning and tried it for about a half a day, and it is complete garbage. My phone would just sit on the table vibrating and pushing buttons on it&apos;s own. Now I&apos;ve had some problems with Android before, but nothing
__label__0 This app, apparently,  caused my phone to catch on fire. BATTERY exploded.  And,  I received a 3rd Degree burn on my thigh because the phone was in my pocket. My mom won&apos;t let me carry a cell phone anymore.  Stupid App!  EVIL.
__label__1 I think the developer needs to rewrite the description as it appears to just be a task killer. It runs fine on the htc evo 3d.
__label__1 i tend to exit out of apps all the time using the home key and i am unaware tue app is still running in tue background. apps such as pandora radio, google maps, or even angry birds. its nice to have an app that will reassure your phone snt working harder
__label__0 Pointless. Read below. Does the same thing as any other, but less pretty and more cluttered. Not even worth it as the free app.
__label__0 As has already been said by others, task killers are pointless and often will do more harm than good in the Android ecosystem.  Unfortunately some people will undoubtedly try this and be tricked into thinking it will do them some good.\n\nAs for the idio
__label__0 Didn&apos;t Amazon learn from the last debacle with a task killer? In twelve hours this app will be rated at 1 1\/2 to 2 stars with hundreds of reviews and nobody will ever touch it again. Idiot developers should have done their homework. \n\nAndroid doe
__label__1 Apps like this are needed for earlier versions of Android... like pre-2.2 Almost all prepaid Android phones are pre 2.2, especially on Boost Mobile. Not everyone runs out to buy the newest phone either. There are plenty of people using the same phone for
__label__0 please downvote any and all apps like this. they don't work,and will actually make android less stable. android knows how to manage memory on its own.
__label__1 My phone performs much faster whenever I do the quick boost. It works great. The widget makes it very convenient. The best memory manager I&apos;ve used
__label__1 Don't allow yourself to be misled by the legions of Android fan boys touting how wonderful its memory management is. The manufacturer's recommendation is to reboot the phone on a daily basis. So, in a nutshell, the Android developers have taken an OS not
__label__0 This provides no benefit to any of the modern phones.  If it were only made available to only ancient phones I would not mind.  But it&apos;s just a placebo for phones.
__label__0 With 2.0 your most used Apps are preloaded into ram, where they sit without using any processor cycles, and therefore use no power. Your phone loads these so it runs faster, then Apps like these use power to empty the ram, which your phone then uses powe
__label__0 First of all this is misnamed as a memory booster. It's not giving you more memory nor is it "managing" your memory in anyway better than what the Android OS does itself. It actually says that this app helps you run at "optimum efficiency" when the only 
__label__0 all this has done is use up more memory. I agree with other comments posted here: its useless program, a waste of my time. I&apos;m going to uninstall it now.
__label__0 as many others have stated, Android 2.0 and above derive no benefit from this kind of app. the developers of these applications are preying on those who don&apos;t understand or care to understand the technology behind their mobile devices. \n\nI also ag
__label__0 android os is optimized to handle memory efficiently on its own. These memory freeing apps cause more harm than good
__label__0 This does not defrag your memory. I&apos;m shocked that this is a paid app. Don&apos;t waste your time on it.
__label__0 The app might be designed well and look nice but like stated before, if you have Android 2.2 or later then you have no need for this app or ones like it for that matter.
__label__0 Memory management apps like this are completely unnecessary with Android 2.x and above. Then the dev has the balls to charge $3 for it?! Get real.
__label__0 this app is so useless, not ever worth the free price tag on app of the day. lets send a message to developers trying to scam hard working folks
__label__0 Glorified task-killer, which does nothing but reduce performance. Many processes killed are automatically reloaded, so worthless. I thought we were done with the age of task killers for android?
__label__0 It makes no sense that Amazon would place this on the market. It has no value, and could lead to wrong- headed understanding of the Android OS. Stay away.
__label__0 Don't waste your time and energy.  It used up far more memory and processing power than it freed. OK, so I need more words to write a review.  I don't tink it is necessary, but if that is what amazon wants so be it.
__label__0 This app is useless, never pay for this as you will be doing more harm to your phone if anything.
__label__0 it doesn&apos;t work. It sucks. needs fixing.  not good at all right now. could be great with a lot of changes
__label__0 With newer Android OS's this application is not really needed. The developer does a decent job of listing out what is staying resident and running in the back ground, but for the most part Android already does the job of cleaning up after itself. It was 
__label__0 like everyone else says , it works against your phone&apos;s natural processes and actually hinders it rather than helps it. Too bad you can&apos;t give 0 stars
__label__1 Couple things to point out it is not helpfull or maybe even possible to defragment a flash memory (i dont know im not a computer expert) Also continually killing a task may use more battery and may slow your phone down if the app is going to start automa
__label__0 Your Android phone will manage resources better than any 3rd party app. If you want to use junk apps, like this, buy an iPhone.
__label__0 When will people/developers learn that task managers/ "memory booster " /ram optimizers are not needed for Android operating system? This does more harm than good. The native scheduler just works fine. Useless app.
__label__0 Defrag memory? That makes no sense, as there is no seek time penalty for RAM. The developer should be ashamed, as should Amazon.
__label__0 Wow. Just when I thought Amazon couldn&apos;t think less of it&apos;s user-base, they go and put garbage like this up. I have grabbed almost every app of the day since the market launched, but I won&apos;t encourage this kind of idiocy by adding this app
__label__0 oohh.. Look at all the bells and whistles and pretty lights. This must be the coolest app ever. Actually that&apos;s all this is. Pretty lights, bells and whistles that blink and ping but don&apos;t really do anything. But it looks pretty. USLESS!!
__label__0 I gave up on task killers months ago and noticed no difference at all. Zese apps, zey do nossing!  Skip this one!
__label__0 This seriously is just a terrible joke. Defrag? If people actually believe that you can defrag your phone or tablet&apos;s FLASH MEMORY, then I have even less hope for humans. Don&apos;t believe this stupid app&apos;s false claims. Don&apos;t bother down
__label__0 There is absolutely no need for something like this. I used to work for US Cellular and the moron regional manager and the store manager decided to make it mandatory to download a task killer onto androids and I can nearly guarantee that every single one
__label__0 shame, shame, shame. These apps never work as they claim to. Your android phones are smart enough to manage without this junk.
__label__0 First of all you proved your either a dev or someone else trying to give props \/ a five star fake review for a this app by what you wrote ie \/ for example saying google I swear this is or was amazon and if im right is not owned by google last I trust t
__label__1 I had to chime in here.  This is a great. app!  Does exactly what it's supposed to do.  My LG Lucid runs great with this app.  Before installing this app, my memory frequently would become bogged down from browsing, game play, etc...  No longer an issue 
__label__1 This app works wonderfully. All those others who gave it a bad review must not have even tried it. Overnight my phone used zero percent battery. It was at 65% when I went to bed, and when I just now got up. Love this app.
__label__0 Android can manage your memory much more effectively than any task killer can. You should definitely avoid this application, and all other task killers.
__label__0 No point of even having this... Total waste of space for newer android phones. How do these poorly written apps even make it on to the market?
__label__1 I use it all the time. It is a real life saver for people who use their phone alot. Speeds my phone up and keeps it in tip top shape..
__label__0 This is the first free app of the day that I haven&apos;t downloaded. I agree with the majority in this case. If you really want to increase performance, root your phone and get ahold of imoseyon tweaks or similar, or try one of the many great ROMs avail
__label__0 Google has designed the Android operating system to do these functions automatically.  Using a program like this may slow your phone, cause extra drain on your battery and require phone reset to uninstall.
__label__0 I wish I could give this app a zero star rating. Utterly useless. I can not believe Amazon is promoting this app.
__label__0 You should avoid task killers at all costs. They actually impede on Android and REDUCE battery life. Hoping for a ban on them someday.
__label__0 doesn&apos;t do anything I can&apos;t already do with the operating system itself. would not recommend this app to anyone. do not download.
__label__0 This will be only the 2nd time since the start of the Amazon App Store opened that I am passing on the free app of the day.  The reason?  Three words: Defrag SD Ram!
__label__0 if you have android 2.0 or better you do not need an app like this. Android pauses any background app and leaves it in memory yes, but will close apps when it naturally needs more. This will drain more battery because its essential fighting the android s
__label__0 ... memory boost app, it destroys your phone more then helps. I never trust any third party app. Just use phone task manager.
__label__0 how can you trust an app with a description that makes no sense. it can&apos;t defrag your memory it just shows you fancy graphs that mean nothing. \n
__label__0 Not to sound mean but yeaaa,  these Apps aren&apos;t needed and if you want to try one,  just get the real atk.
__label__0 Current versions of Android manage memory extremely effectively. Memory managers, task killers, and the like are not only pointless but can cause problems. No one who owns a current phone should install this, and anyone who has should uninstall it.
__label__0 this app is not needed, task killers can kill operating system for your phone that are needed to run at its best. also plz give bad review, amazon has been putting nothing but useless apps out lately
__label__0 Android does this on it&apos;s own, all this app is going to do is drain your battery. I guess I should have read the description,  I thought it was a logic game lol. As with 85% of the &quot;free&quot; apps Amazon puts on here...this ones garbage. I thi
__label__0 This is a dumb app both in its worthlessness for Android and in the ripoff it is to anyone that gets sucked into paying for it.
__label__0 just another task killer, and as long as you&apos;re at android 2.0 or above, your device manages it&apos;s memory efficiently enough. these types of apps are actually bad for your device, they take up their own system and slow things down by closing ope
__label__0 There are a lot of red flags in the description for this app. For recent versions of android, this app will hurt both performance and battery life. The android kernel does much of this already and it does it much more efficiently.
__label__1 been using this all day on my htc inspire 4g. so far I&apos;ve actually have seen an improvement on my battery life. I used to have to charge my phone halfway through the day and today I. didnt have to. So thanks for this app Amazon and the developer. I 
__label__0 Android was made to multitask. If you use a task killer, it only interferes with the way Android is built to work, therefore it makes your phone worse. Read what Gizmodo and Lifehacker have to say about these task killers.
__label__0 defrag your memory? no android phone or tablet has a harddrive that&apos;s capable of being defragged. shame on the developers for making people pay for a fake product.\nshame on you Amazon for promoting a fake product
__label__0 I installed it and ran it. it looks very pretty but when I tried to free memory it free&apos;d like 500 bytes. I tried this multiple times ( it makes you wait 10 mins each time) and same result. so I don&apos;t see the advantage of it. looks pretty but d
__label__0 Waste of time for my phone. May be needed on older phones. Just a waste of space on my thunderbolt!
__label__0 Android systems do not need task killers. They are useless. That is all this app is, a useless task killer.
__label__0 Not even worth the time it takes to download.  Does not increase performance, battery life, or your desirability to the opposite sex.
__label__0 This type of product is a digital snake oil for your phone. Your Android smartphone is actually smart about how it manages applications and resources. Apps like this one work against your phone and any effort it will make to maximize its battery life. Ye
__label__0 like every one else is saying about these deceptive developers that make a suposed memory booster or battery maximizer, they just hinder your phone more than help it
__label__0 Unless you have an android with a software version of 2.0 or earlier then this program and all other programs like it will NOT help you. In fact it can things to run slower.
__label__1 I use FltPlan.com on a daily basis, and this app makes my job even easier! I just got a new tablet, and with 2 clicks I have all of the information I need to plan a flight. I have used every section of this app, and none of them have disappointed me. A m
__label__1 I love watching videos and this app allows me to watch videos from my favorite artists.  I always am able to keep up on what I love listening too.
__label__1 I love this on my kindle fire because I hate that youtube mobile doesn't support VEVO but this app...I love it!
__label__0 doesn'T play youtube playlists, takes forever to start and won't play playlists and search engine sucks !!!! if I could rate properly = minus 5 stars.There is not a single youtube app that will play my full playlist with no problems, FREEdi youtube playe

__label__1 You can get any music video in the world and on the website! This is so cool to finally be able to watch music videos at a resturant!
__label__1 I enjoy being able to watch music videos for some of the songs I like.  I also like the fact that you are able to search for what you likes and the  wide selection available.
__label__1 If you love to watch music videos at your leisure, you must have this app.  I love VEVO--lots of videos (many times UNCUT), just a finger-tap away.
__label__0 My tablet alert me of a virus with this so. I had to get rid of this.
__label__1 This is a must have app for anyone that wants to watch music videos. The video quality is amazing and you can save playlists.
__label__1 I really live this app. This is my go to music app. I can pick the songs/videos I want to see and add them to my playlist and it is free. Love that.
__label__0 I thought this app would be great and it was finnaly one that i would love it worked for abot 20 minutes and suddenly stopped working so i had to delete it

__label__0 I had to uninstall this app. It wasnt what I thought it would be .it didnt play well on my kindle. Maybe I didnt give it time
__label__0 music apps are only good if it plays the music u want and keeps playing while u play on apps this app only plays what you want! THIS APP SUCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
__label__1 the only bad thing is the error part but besides that its great I love it its finally a decent app with vevos
__label__1 Do you know why I love vevo is because they have every music you could think of. I love it
__label__1 The Videos are free to watch in terms of money, but you do have to spend a little time watching a commercial every now and again.  I didn't count but it seemed like one commercial every four or five videos.  The search function will find videos in the li
__label__0 This app runs very poorly (when it runs at all) on the Fire. It crashes frequently and you have to force a close. In a few cases it locked up my Fire so I had to power down to recover.The few videos I did manage to play were very low res and unpleasant t
__label__1 vevo always has the songs you want to hear! browse through some top songs now or some older classics! i love vevo app!
__label__1 This app is the best app if you love music videos!  it's always up to date with the latest premieres!
__label__1 It does just what it says so you do not have to worry about going on YouTube and then having to connect to vevo
__label__0 Dont even remember this so it was not good I would guess.  Other wise wouldnt I have remembered it? :(
__label__1 I find the colour, clarity and quality to be excellent and so easy to access... even my 6 year old granddaughter loves it and can access it on her own!
__label__1 it is truly awesome. it has all my fav. songs and more. all the songs are really easy to find
__label__1 I am glad they have an app so, I can see my favorite videos without going to my computer. My kids like it as well but, make sure you monitor what they are looking at. I also love the fact that it is free! I can see older videos that I have not seen in a 
__label__1 very nice HD quality, my favorite app for music videos, very easy to download, will definitely tell my peeps about this app.
__label__1 Great Video app, simply add your e mail and and pass from Face book or twitter I think it was?.... if you like to save all your free videos that is lol.. Poke around to get used to the buttons, but most of all, &quot;top right corner&quot; for your playl
__label__0 Extremely slow. Very blurry and hard to hear. I do not recommend this app. Absolutely terrible app. Don't get this app. It's not worth your time
__label__1 I like these songs man it is so cool you should download it is so awesome it is a funny name
__label__1 My friend got this and she said it was great so I decided to get it and it is awesome
__label__1 This is a good app. Ive downloaded it to my other devices works great with them... if it would just download to my kindle fire... that would be great!
__label__1 This app is the best thing to ever happen to me. Usually I get bored of an app really easily, and uninstall it a week later. But I've had this app for 6 months. Its so worth it. It doesn't even cost anything! IT'S FREE! You get all the music videos of bi
__label__1 Love this app it's very cool and its free I am very much enjoying this app it's really great and awesome if u get it u will love it and enjoy it because of the music to

__label__1 I very much enjoy watching music videos from my favorite singers.There are many videos to chose from as well as artists.
__label__1 Most Videos are in HD both on Tv and Amazon kindle. Brand new video are posted up all the time and its simple to look up videos by searching artist up.I also like the Vevo live though i dont always watch it, i do sometimes. you can look up music videos i
__label__1 Any of the top music videos are found on this. it is great if you would like to get caught up on all the new music and videos
__label__1 Music is beautiful, and its my life. So I got this app, and no music is with me on the go! Get this app, and you will be happy you did.
__label__1 I recommend this app to anybody who likes music videos you can browse all kinds of categories within the app very good app I get this five stars five funds up for a good app.
__label__0 it does not work well at all on a kindle fire. don't waste your time. I love vevo but this version ain't working.  please fix and I will change to 5 stars easy
__label__1 This app is amazing! it works very well and the videos are all HD even if you dont have the best internet. Its great!
__label__1 Love anything free. My kids love it because they get to see all the new releases.  I like it also I can watch all my favorite singers when ever I want.  And it a whole lot easier to use then the VH1 on the DTV4 loader.
__label__1 works great on my kindle fire :) way better than youtube. haven't had any problems with it. videos load quickly and play without having to stop and reload. A+
__label__1 must have if you like music videos. has great play lists and new music before it hits youtube. better than youtube
__label__1 My on &#34; hooked&#34; me up to VEVO. I spent mot of my time in rehab listening and watching the video.
__label__0 this app is so confusing I can not make heads nor tails on how to use it.  it is useless and not useable.
__label__1 I especially love the 80's music videos from the day when they first became hugely popular on cable TV.  Vevo allows me the joy of revisiting most all those videos, or other genres of music video since it automatically customizes subsequent selections to
__label__1 I love this app I watch all my music videos on it and justin bieber videos I really recommend it
__label__0 I have tried to play vevo on my kindle fire HD but, it is not working at all. I still have the same videos on here from weeks ago I thought it is suppose to change up to different video's. I am so disappointed at this app rite now because I love beck and
__label__1 i love this and enjoy for hours of entertainment. the search engine is very easy to use and i enjoy just about any music videos there is to take me back to old days yesssss!!!
__label__1 i like watching music videos on this app, it also found me new songs to listen to. i like it
__label__1 Vevo works perfectly on my Kindle Fire. This app makes downloading music videos a breeze. Very similar to you tube except this is for music videos only. I love it and would highly recommend it. This app is another must have!!
__label__0 The picture quality was horrible. I couldn't even see peoples faces, because the videos were so pixelated. This is a really bad product.
__label__1 Easy to use Vevo music video app. Be able to view your favorite music videos on your tablet for free.
__label__1 This is a great app! I love it, because you can watch music videos for free, in HD without having to download them!
__label__0 would never let me on there
__label__1 This is great! I absolutely love it. The quality of the videos are very sharp and clear. The sound is outstanding.There is absolutely no comparison! It works perfectly with my Kindle HD.
__label__0 i didnt like this at all....couldnt really use it the way i would youtube......i would recommend youtube to anyone who wants to watch music videos.....
__label__1 This is cool to be able to watch music videos that my kind of stuff,  i hope that kindle fire have some more good apps
__label__1 I am so happy to find a station with videos in it. and Free is my cup of tea....Thanx y'all for the good things you do.
__label__1 I love it and it keeps me up to date on the new and old music and video's have it on my ipod also.
__label__0 vevo is messed up because whenever you start listening to music and watching it says vevo isn't responding so you have to exit out
__label__1 It's a great app. If you want to listen to your favorite singer or band, get this app. It's a great app and it's free
__label__1 You name the genre of music you like and make a video playlist.  The video qualty is great for most videos, and you can fine tune the videos to your taste or just start the videos playing and VEVO will keep the videos coming in the genre you adore.  Must
__label__1 This works as well on Kindle Fire HDX as it did on IPad. The updates have really improved speed and efficiency.I use it much more because it's now very user friendly with great picture quality.
__label__0 I tried too leave an opinion for you , but some idiot  stoped me from doing it. I was  trying to express my feeling about  how I hate face book sing in. I really,wanted to ,use your app, but facebook won't let me sign in. That ok I find another way to se
__label__1 This app. is amazing you don't have to go through the trouble of downloading your own music, its all there and you get to watch the music videos!
__label__0 This app sucks! It Plays videos fine but first it forces you to post every little thing you are listening to facebook if you want to be able to create a playlist. Why do these companies Apple, &amp; Tootle &amp; Aneroid Have to have to try to know as muc
__label__1 I myself do not like Google or anything there about. That is one of the main reasons I like Vevo so much. It just needs that extra push to get it more popular! Love it though. Keep it up!
__label__0 The choices of music just weren't for me-more for the younger generation. It was a good variety of artists though.
__label__1 When Vevo first appeared as an app on my Roku, I started compiling histories, for playlists, of my favorite videos.  Then I discovered a Lebanese video by Myriam Fares, then another.  I emailed Vevo to tell them Hey, I'd pay a little for something like t
__label__0 terrible unreliability on the Kindle,  crashed constantly. that problem is exacerbated by vevo blocking users from viewing their videos through youtube on mobile devices
__label__1 So much better than Pandora! You can watch ANYTHING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! You can pick a genre, from gospel 2 metal. u can do anything!!!!!!
__label__0 I love the vevo music videos on YouTube but this app is terrible. It only has a small number of the videos that they have posted on YouTube. Also it takes forever to load and the app design is not very user friendly. Not reccomended.
__label__0 I was excited when I saw there was a VEVO app but the video quality is extremely poor.  I'm not sure if these videos just look that way anyway or if it's just because of my Kindle Fire HD...
__label__0 Why am I being foreced to write words? If I have nothing to say then why do I need to type? This is very annoying.
__label__1 OMG! I love the fact that you can create your own VIDEO playlist. You can listen to videos over and over and over again! There is a variety of music from KORN to Una. Thrilled I can use and the cost is free. Cant get much better than that! I would defini
__label__1 This app is good to have so you can log in, set your fav's and watch the music videos you want when you want and without having to upgrade to anything.
__label__1 My step-daughters love this app....they watch music videos all the time. They also love their Kindle Fires. Amazon is awesome.
__label__1 When traveling with my granddaughters (15 & 4 yrs old) it keeps them occopied.  They are in different age bracket but both can enjoy it.
__label__1 VEVO - Watch Free Music Videos  allows you to watch a whole bunch of GREAt videos on your Kindle Fire.
__label__1 This App is my favorite.  Whether I want to listen to an entire album or a particular song, it's all there. Plus, new albums just out are on there too and I can decide whether I want purchase it or not.  You can even program it to play a set of your favo
__label__1 I tried to get on a music video and it was freaking me out it was like the worst horror movie evermore thank goodness for this app now I don't have to get scared out of my mind.
__label__1 What can I say but thank you very much, since I found this app on my Kindle Fire HD that's pretty much where it stays Just  like Pandora for music but with never ending playing music videos that learn what you like. SWEET.
__label__1 i luv this app its like so kewl.i tried it on meh friends phone and its kewl.u guys should get this im 12 and i &lt;3 it!!!!! : )
__label__0 but then it started deleting my playlists, then it started taking forever to load a video and then it just stopped working completely.... so not worth the hassel!-
__label__0 The ads would load the stop at 1 at every video. This app is stupid. Vevo please fix this crappy app.
__label__1 So, more than likely you won't be able to use this on any school/college exam due to be on a smartphone, but if you could it would work great.  Easy to read and calculates everything I can throw at it.
__label__1 I am not qualified to evaluate this app, but it seems like it would calculate anything.  Works on my Kindle Fire HD 2nd generation.
__label__1 This app is beautifully designed and implemented.  It provides a wealth of scientific functions, most of which many people will never use.However...Even if you don't need it today, you might tomorrow.  Or later on.  If not you then your parents, kids, si

__label__1 This is a really NICE calculator.  It isn't a 100% replica of the HP-12C that I used through much of my early/mid professional career (before smartphones), but it is damn close -- close enough to save me from carrying another device.  Works pretty much l
__label__1 This does everything my trust 12C did, perfectly.  This is really so much cheaper and better than the original 12C (which I lost, ugh), that I would recommend buying a phone rather than the calculator, then installing this app.  It is that good.  Just li
__label__1 This is very impressive. RPN has been a preference of mine.  I find it difficult to write anything that wasn't already written by Thom Bone.  Fantastic app on the Kindle. I do miss real buttons.
__label__1 Well I have to say all the functions this has is beyond my wildest dreams I purchased many scientific calculators from radio shake in my day, as high priced as $120 bucks for one that faded away with time! This surpasses them all!Thanks DEV for making su
__label__1 I fondly remember my HP-12C that helped me graduate from Engineering University.  This is a great application and I am enjoying the memories of RPN.  If you don't know what RPN stands for, this is NOT the calculator app for you.Get this app!
__label__1 I got this on the 8th as Amazon's free app of the day but it is definitely worth the $2.30 asking price. I used to tutor math and physics and we always used Texas Instrument's calculators as they were the ones recommended by the school or professor. I li
__label__1 This is hands-down the best non-game FAOTD in a while, so don't miss it. It would be a bargain even at the regular price of two dollars and change. I started with an HP-35 in the early 1970s after the original price had dropped substantially, and I've be
__label__1 I have used scientific calculators for decades and my first one was the Bomar MX100 that I purchased in 1974 for almost $200 dollars.  That was a fortune back then (About $1008 in today's dollars).  We have come a long way in research since then but to s
__label__1 Closest thing to my beloved HP-12C on my Kindle. If I don't have my financial calculator with me, I usually have the Kindle. And I am so stuck on RPN (Reverse Polish Notation) that I hate using other calculators as a result. Anyway, a nice app to have.
__label__1 This app has been able to handle everything ive thrown at it. I believe it's on track to replace my old calculator.
__label__1 I saw it in the apps and didnt believe it could do so many things. It does and much more. This is one application that everyone should have in their Kindle. Amazon should have it installed in the Kindle without having to purchase it.
__label__1 It does what it says, turning my tablet into an HP with reverse polar notation.  Very crisp keys, nice response, changes from landscape to portrait seamlessly.  As someone who cut my teeth with programmable calculators in the final years before PC's came
__label__1 Calculators with these functions used to be expensive. This one does it all casual or scientific applications are all there. Interface highly intuitive. Need a calculator? Look no further.
__label__1 It looks and works exactly as the original HP calculator.I am very happy of having purchase and installed this application
__label__0 I'll never understand why the engineering community chose calculators based on RPN (Reverse Polish Notation)... And if if that term alone doesn't give you some kind of a clue why TI calculators are so much easier to use, you have no hope. There are a sle
__label__0 Never would use it because I do not understand those calculations and I am too old to learn such things
__label__1 After you install this calculator, scroll down to the bottom of the app page and download:My RPN Calc User's GuideThis is a very comprehensive guide to the RPN calculators by this developer.The icon for the user's guide will appear next to the icon for t
__label__1 Examples of a couple of the accuracy tests I ran on this app:--The "one divided by nine" test: Basic fractional math tells us that one divided by nine and then multiplied by nine (1/9 x 9) should equal one. An accurate calculator will spit out the number
__label__1 This is one *serious* combination calculator... and extremely well designed inerface that uses hardly any OS/battery resources and the most minimal permission.  Definitely a keeper... (going to shoot some emails off to a few friends, letting them know th
__label__1 If you like your HP12C you'll like this app too.  With the exception of the tactile feel of the keys it works exactly the same as the physical calculator.  RPN is the way to go.
__label__1 I once built a Heathkit calculator, that used reverse polish notation,  so I purchased this app just to see if it was similar.  Haven't delved into all the different things it offers, but then I don't deal with statistics very much.
__label__1 Unbelievable price....Free.... for such a tool.  Einstein would have cherished this scientific tool as he would his crazy hair style. I highly recommend this calculator.
__label__0 I thought this game sounded interesting, but it requires you to create an account to play. After several attempts and repeatedly being told my email address is &quot;invalid&quot;, despite having entered it correctly, I decided not to bother. I do have a
__label__0 I just fired up this game for the first time.  I couldn't recall if there was a pay version or in game pay system, but I make a point to go past compensation and reward good development and service.While not a fan of Java and its' community's dedication 
__label__1 I've played this game over a year, while it was still Age of Thrones.  With Age of Ascension, the game is essentially doubled, because you can now travel the sky as well as terrain and water.When you start playing, you're assigned a mentor.  Mentors are 
__label__1 I love this game, can't get enough of it. Although here on Amazon, for some reason you don't get the most up to date versions.
__label__1 A fun and challenging game . Very addictive . I play for hours at a time . I hope some day I can play on my Kindle Fire .
__label__1 My grand daughter loves this app. She played with it all day after unloaded it on. Whenever she sees my kindle she says game...game....and points to the Santa app
__label__1 kid loves opening santas sack. he likes all the free ones by the talking tom cat company. I wont buy any of the others though... not for a 3 yr old.
__label__1 I think this game is amazing that when you think of fun its crazy fun!!!!!Kylie Ann RoppLOVE IT,WOW.
__label__0 There is a hacker !!! It is made by out fit 7!!! I heard a girl had an out fit 7 app (talking Angela) and she had a daughter who got asked a lot of questions like where do you live and she told it and Angela said I will visit you and the hacker went ther
__label__0 I didn't like it. I didn't think it was appropriate for my kids even with the parental controls. Santa pulls his pants down.
__label__1 This keeps my son entertained and I enjoy hearing him laugh!Thanks for a cute app for him to play!
__label__0 I can't get this app to install, it is just hanging out in limbo on the top of the screen. it won't delete either. it's making me a little crazy
__label__0 This would have been a great app, one that my young nephew was really looking forward to. However, while the graphics were great, the sound quality was horrible and very laggy. Santa's voice actually scared my nephew!! I didn't spend a lot on this app, b
__label__1 i was on the website when i saw that they had an app now so i installed it and it works great
__label__0 The app itself installed quickly & easily via Amazon's download. The DATABASE is another story! I tried getting the DATABASE to download to my Samsung Infuse 4g. Over a period of 2 hours it tried to download the database and never finished (thank heavens
__label__0 Before I even type 2 letters, it tells me it has stopped working, and takes me to my home screen.
__label__1 Every easy to use for Spanish class. I like this app and it is useful. if you want to look anything up in Spanish I think it has it.
__label__1 the most accurate Spanish to English dictionary. recommended the website also, and lots of teachers prefer the us of this. worth the... oh wait its free. yup.
__label__1 I enjoyed this app and it is a welcome edition to my kindle fire.I would reccomend this app for a reference on your tablet.
__label__1 Word of the day helps expand your vocabulary.  Excellent tool for learning Spanish. I would definitely recommend to a friend.
__label__0 I thought it was strange that this app wanted internet access. While I don't doubt that it has some reason for it, my Amazon password--and every other stored password in my phone--was somehow deregistered after playing this app once.TBH, the game play su
__label__0 I don't like to give bad reviews to games, but man this game is crap. the graphics and the design is so bad, it is unbelievable. sad, sad game.
__label__1 u dont play much games, but this game is addicting.  its not your typical shoot 'em up game and i like that.
__label__1 I really enjoyed this game. Animation kind of lame. Sound was annoying. But the physics were great. As you advance, the explosives get more powerful, and you can get more creative. And being free, why even the haters can't complain. 5 stars because I lik
__label__0 1st of all, this is a weak attempt at stealing someone else's game idea. shame on you! secondly, there is no volume control. I hope no one made the mistake of paying money for this.
__label__1 Everyone in here is such a perfectionist. I swear, a working app cannot even get a 3 star rating. Why is everything compared to Angry Birds? Angry birds blows, and its old. All of these reviewers make developers NOT want to make apps.I didnt even dl or p
__label__1 You can make things and blow them up. Rewards strategy,foresight, not just another kill kill kill game, but still high on the testoterone level for my grade school guys. Graphics are what I think of as Early Android: objects are geeky rather than elegant
__label__1 You'll love this game. Nicely done with some new elements and gameplay. It represents the genre well, better than most. Easy 5 star blow up game.
__label__0 i in front of the app name completely ruins the game.  1 star because of that.  Won't even try the game because iAnything is lame.
__label__1 I didn't download this expecting to waste hours of time and I won't.  That's what HexDefense is for.  But the game is simple and somewhat addictive.  It plays very well on my Droid X, unrooted of course.  The only quirk I had was the Level Completion dia
__label__0 bad physics and graphics!  sounds are cheesy and just plain old boring. the simple things that amuse some of you people.......................
__label__1 if you for a nice little time killer game, then download, pretty fun, kinda repetative, but hey for the price.graphics are good, could be better, sounds not that bad.worth a 5 star rating in my book, so like i said, if you want a nice time killer than do
__label__0 I thought it was live camras. I will remove it from my Kindle Fire. Doing this review made me remember that I had it.
__label__0 a complete waste of time and money.  very limted choices, and no way to just do random cameras. maybe I don't understand the comcept.  I recommend iSpycameras
__label__0 its just a bunch of pics. its not videos all it does is show u stupid pica don't buy it
__label__1 This is an excellent shopping list that allows full addition of items including price. You can just select from a list for needed items and add in the quantity. As you check off items it asks for price and gives a total for purchases.The only drawback is
__label__0 Wasn't what I was looking for.  Too much set up time and too tedious.  Just want something with a list.
__label__0 I took it off.  It was not easy to use as advertised. Much to complicated to set up; not intuitive;  directions were NOT helpful.
__label__1 I love that you can save the prices. no more guessing how much my bill will be! very handy with stores that only accept cash. also love that I can save the stores. makes it easy to know which store has the best bargain. perfect for families on a budget!
__label__1 I really like this App. It is easy to use and lets me create multiple lists, sort by category,sort by aisle and store. It's great.
__label__0 this app is LAME I thought it was something bettter but... no.  % g g g g g gvgvgvv g v
__label__1 Took a few seconds for my little processor to focus the images, but when it did - Wow! Fractals make math pretty for we who do not get it. Well worth the tiny amt of space it takes. Thanks, David.
__label__1 I have been using this app for months and I still love it. It's not just a &quot;time waster&quot; for me; it's therapeutic. I use a Droid Incredible and have had no issues with the app of any kind.
__label__1 This free app is well worth downloading!  I bought a math co-processor for my first computer in the 80's so I could process fractals more quickly, and even so, I had to let each deep zoom process overnight because it tied the computer up for so long.  Th
__label__1 A great app for math geeks out there (like me). It's hard to figure out at first, but when you do, it'll be that much more awesome.
__label__0 I would love to make beautiful fractal art like what is shown to get you to get the app. I can't make it do anything! There is not instruction manual or in app direction whatsoever. Don't get this app.
__label__0 okay first of all I could not use the app because when I open there is a note saying something about David Byrne. DO Not get this app.
__label__0 Game sucks so boring every time I play on it. It gives me the same one so annoying it never gives u a new 1 so dumb and the same thing happens over and over can't stand it so I got rid of it!
__label__0 I don't know if you have to be a math wizard to make these beautiful fractals or not...I'm not.  All I can do is make blobs.  I would love to make pretty ones and save them...wish there was a tutorial and/or drag with stylus/finger to create new images. 
__label__1 Please tell me where the menu button is....then I can fully review.  But for now, I can't change the formula.Edited:Found the menu...fantastic, now I can adjust the formulas.It's no apophysis, but fun nonetheless.
__label__1 this game is the best app ever because you can do different pictures every time and always have it turn out good.
__label__1 Fractals have fascinated me from the time I first heard the word "fractal" in the 1970s. Without powerful computers and hi-res color monitors, and proper software, however, they were mostly just academic. Now, it's possible to see their beauty and experi
__label__1 this app. is a must for all math freaks, and it is free, what more can i say it rocks...
__label__1 Great for making backgrounds and manipulating otherwise confounding mathematical equations :) takes the hard work out of the results :) thanks :)
__label__1 I can't work out where it saves images of fractals but it is easy to change the designs with the menu, then zoom the image and imagine your processor straining to render it ! Very relaxing and a good time killer.
__label__1 This is a fun app and great for sharing! Also an interesting way to introduce beautiful math. We've made some interesting personalized images. Thanks!
__label__1 This app as the other person put it is frackin fantastic!!!!!Its so frackin addicting!If your are a creative person or just want to try it out this app is for you!!!!!I highly recommend fractoid!!:D
__label__1 Use of menu to change math and options makes easy to use. I quickly found a design that is appealing for my wallpaper.
__label__1 Enjoying this app. Always had a fondness for fractals and this does job nicely. I would like to see more Colorado options but still a great app.
__label__1 I am a big fan of fractals, fractal art, and fractals. I adore looking at them. There isn't much to say about this app. It's got lots of pretty fractals, you can zoom out (and zoom in almost infinitely), change equations, backgrounds, and other things. I
__label__0 Do you have a college degree in advanced mathematics?  If you do, then maybe you can get this app to work. There is no tutorial... there are no instructions... nothing. Pushing the few buttons that there are results in  very little change to the blobby t
__label__1 It works great on my KindleFire and I think they are breath taking to look at mind blowing to comprehend. Whoever worked on this gets an A+!!
__label__1 Now, this is a game. You pay for it and it's well worth it. Bought this a while back from a game company for my computers. When I saw this for my Kindle Fire HD I couldn't pass it up. Lots of action and well worth the money. And be sure to buy Monkey Mon
__label__1 love this game so much fun to play like all the colors and the sounds the bounses are good to cant play it enough.
__label__1 love this. I just keep winning. when down in dumps, it's fun to play and bring me up. Fun Fun
__label__1 The artwork is very good. Lots to enjoy for all ages. It's worth every penny and then some. Tap quickly and you might get the bonus more easily! Gotta love those monkeys!
__label__1 I reallt enjoy playing this slot game. The graffics are cute, the reels turn in a good pace and the slots are loose enough that you can enjoy the bonus', which is what you are playing for anyway.  Its alot of fun
__label__1 This game is so boring that I am only up to $768,996,235.88.  I play it for hours and really enjoy everything about the game.  I have not mastered every aspect yet so I am obligated to keep playing until I do.  I hope to hit a billion dollars soon.
__label__1 I can remember playing this little game back in the day. Challenging, simple and fun. The only downfall I have with it is there's no sound. Maybe mine was a fluke? Who knows, but encourage you to get this game. Did I mention it's free???
__label__1 I used to play this on the computer in the early 90s.  I'm glad to see an Android version for my Kindle Fire HD. This is a neat little version, with nice background pictures.  Now if I can just get past the 5-ball level....
__label__1 JezzBall is an engaging game where you separate the bouncing balls until you manage to enclose over 75% of the screen to earn your score.  If you're proficient enough to enclose over 80%, you receive bonus points.  If one of you balls connect with the li
__label__1 The only reason I am giving reviews is that it is free.  I feel I owe it to the developers.  This game is fun and challenging.  Looks pretty on the Kindle Fire.I really missed playing Jezzball.  I couldn't believe I found it for the Kindle Fire. Great li
__label__0 I signed  up for an account on the traditional website, downloaded the  app but it won't let me login. When I click on login it redirects me back to my Kindle Main screen. Too bad, I was hoping this would be a neat tool to take with me to family gatherin
__label__0 this app duz absolutely nothing! u hav 2 make the tree yorself and it duznt know anything! dont waste yor time with this app. this deserves -7 stars.
__label__0 It needs wifi ! That defeats the whole purpose of digging up family history in the car...Make sure u no u need wifi.!!!!
__label__0 This did not do what i wanted it to do so i deleted it. It may good for others just did not like the program.
__label__0 Can't compete with the weather channel app for a free weather app. I tossed it. Have tried all the popular ones and this was a no keeper.
__label__1 It's a good, but very basic, weather widget for your phone or tablet.I for some reason really like the way the little Android logo looks, so getting a weather app with this as the display is great.I like the app alot, but I wanted a bit more functionalit
__label__0 I love the little droid but the weather isn't up to date. The temperature on him isn't the same as when you click on him to get the forecast. He doesn't refresh to the current temp
__label__1 THIS COOL WEATHER DROID TELLS YOU THE 5 DAY FORECAST IN YOUR TOWN AND HE IS GREEN AND DRESSES ACCORDING TO THE WEATHER.  YOU CAN ALSO VIEW A MAP OF YOUR LOCATION'S WEATHER LIVE.
__label__1 I really like this weather app.  it's simple but informative, while being cuteand helpful.  I really like that the droid is dressed for the weather because frankly I nee help with that!  I am new to the Northeast region.  if it had gloves and hat Id give
__label__1 This game is fun, lasts for hours and is very addictive!  Play it to relax or play it to pass the time.  It is fun.
__label__1 This is a nice addition to the match three gaming genre. For those of you who love match three games, this one is for you. It has different levels of gameplay and gives special objects throughout the game which you can use if you run out of moves. The gr
__label__1 It's really hard to stop playing! Bright, crisp graphics and responsive action. It's nice to be able to slide jewels rather than having to click each item to move.
__label__1 I got this game for free using the GetJar app. Aces Jewel Hunt works,looks great on the Kindle Fire and game play is very simular to classic Jewel games.
__label__1 This game is really worthwhile to purchase!! I'm totally impressed with the stunning graphics and game play!!Without giving too much away from your experience, your offered 3 levels of game strategy! Which I find worth the 5 stars alone! You'll see when 
__label__1 I love this game and all of my grandchildren do too. good eye  to hand coordination . All ages like to play and is suitable for all.
__label__0 I can not believe this app is still around. Web sign on does not work, and it does not even sync on the phone app. Just tells you to hold on while it syncs but it does not connect. All those pictures you see need to be downloaded to your phone's SD card 
__label__0 AS AN UPDATE, my last review (below) was October 4, 2011, and the developer does not respond to inquiries to the apps problems, nor has the problem been fixed, despite numerous in-app reports sent to the developer within their own app.  I currently use O
__label__0 Created an account to sync with everything and their website is never available- rendering the app usless and my list gone forever.  Company needs to be on top of their problems and fix this- same goes for the paid app- good idea- just not handled very w
__label__0 My grandson downloaded on my kindle.  I looked at it and didn't see that it was something I would be interested in, so I deleted it.  Good thing it was free.
__label__0 I downloaded this game and never played it.  It was not what I was expecting, so I uninstalled the app.
__label__0 Thank goodness I did not pay for this one.  What a waste.  You have only so many chances to do the "readings" and then if you want more...you have to pay (of course!!).  Might be fun for a party, but it had better be a small party!  LOL
__label__0 cause you have only any 9 tries and then you need to either buy or uninstall it again.... so. I just uninstalled it.
__label__0 Not at all as I expected! I thought this would help someone like me, who has been out of school for a while, understand the basics. Not so. Not impressed at all. So if you have an idea of what you are doing, it may work, otherwise, I think it's a waste b
__label__1 works well and I like that it shows step-by-step how to work out problems. Older versions made choosing specific problems and levels easier but each update has improved program itself and how it teaches (unlike updates of some programs which just seem to
__label__1 This app is helpful because it covers the different standards of algebra and it shows you the steps of the problems and how to do it. When I first started using this the numbers seemed foreign but after a short while I was mastering the equations like wo
__label__1 I have already learned what I needed to to bring back some of the fun of figuring out what the value of X is.
__label__0 Downloaded with no issues, but when launched, the app immediately generates an error indicating that the website it needs to connect to is nonexistent or unavailable, and nothing further can be done with it.
__label__1 This is fun. I really don't know what else yo say so I'm just going to type until I meet the word minimum.
__label__1 I have little background in music. I am a listener. But I always wanted to understand the basic elements to make one. This app is allowing me to do that. I have tried on my PC with Sony Acid, but it is not intuitive and demand more time to learn than I a
__label__1 Wow,  great for a musician who wants to do stuff on their phone. Clean interface, worth the money. Works great on tmobile g2.
__label__0 I assumed this app had something to do with music. It turns out it is just a soundboard with a few pointless sound effects. I can't imagine it actually costing $4.99. It must be some mistake. This entire app is a mistake.
__label__1 Definitively a great use and/or display of android versatility.  Well made and easy to use. Comes with some great track downloads, too.
__label__1 lol, a really fun app, you can create, compose even if you don't know anything about music. many options and easy to use. I'm a composer now! music here i come
__label__0 this app is mediocre at best. you only loop pre-recorded sounds that the app has (which are few) Yes you can upload your own .wav files, but seriously, if you are going to take the time to find or create them you might as well stick to editing software o
__label__1 This app is for all levels of music abilities. The options seem endless. I have been having so much fun creating music with this app that I had to pull myself away to write this!
__label__0 It seems the developers of this app are not musicians, and know nothing about music. it has no staves, notes or anything even resembling them! Even those basic piano apps with recording functionality are better than this!  A real music notation software 
__label__1 Some little factoids about me (to bore the living daylights out of you): Guitarist with 20+ years experience. Manipulate digital audio and make music on my DAW. ("DAW" is an acronym for "Digital Audio Workstation" for you Philistines.) So I know a thing 
__label__1 gonna search some tutorials. online. to learn how to use it more efficiently,  great app of the day yes!!! party tonight
__label__0 Looks simple and easy, but starts confusing you by playing things you never clicked. Keeps making it's own defaults so I have no input. All the sounds are dumb, too. Waste of my time.
__label__0 Got this program as the free ap of the day, but really didn't use it.  I wish the Kindle allowed users to access Google play
__label__1 I think this is a fun app! Do a little dance, make a little music, feel the beat! Enjoy the process.
__label__1 If you just want to play around with sounds and a beat then this is the app for you. Anyone who rates this a 1 star just isn't musically inclined. Which everyone is not, I know that, but don't bash a good app because you can't roll a beat.
__label__1 I've spent so much time randomly tinkering around with this, and the Devs give great support. It's been updated numerous times and I can't put it down sometimes, sucks me in for hours. Love this music app.
__label__1 Don't listen to the naysayers regarding this app.  Yes if you just open it up and start clicking around it seems that it doesn't do a lot other than play some techno beats. But after you read the directions &amp; figure out how to really use the app you'
__label__0 the app is only fun for 2 minutes until you realize there are only Bout ten different sounds u can make... waste of time.
__label__0 I have waited for a fix but the app will never open. A refund would be nice! I am sure it is a great app for those who can get it to work. Sorry I purchased this.
__label__0 this app is total crap just like these 4-5 star reviews if you want to enhance this app you will have to pay five bucks for it here on Amazon again another crappy worthless FAOTD and more fake 4-5 star reviews
__label__1 App works well. Clean ui with lots of options. I agree with the previous reviewer that this doesnt have a lot of potential for practical application. Serious musicians would use a more professional setup. Still a very polished and fun app.
__label__1 I like the app. It does what it says it will do. It works reliably and sounds good. I saw someone that rated it low because that person didn't know what to do with it. That's the problem with the free app thing, people just download it because it's free.
__label__1 Well, it's not really my style but, I heard a techno song one time that went like...And then this other part came in and it was like...
__label__1 I've used this application for several months.  After trying some others and reading reviews I chose this sin embargo it was the most feature rich and solid.  No problems at all running on a TMO G2.
__label__1 I must confess, ive recently bought an iPad 2 and have been neglecting my Thunderbolt and Transformer while I play with apps like Garage Band and more recently dJay, fantastic apps to create and mix yours and others music, I was just thinking of looking 
__label__0 I payed for this game and I didn't get anything out of it at all! It is not entertaining and it is a waste of money and time.
__label__1 To the person that gave it one star because it had no tools to create sheet music style composites, you obviously missed the entire purpose of this app. It is used for creating music loos from samples, and not for laying out notes on a page. It does what
__label__0 Total crap. It works, I don't like it at all. One of those apps that would trick an idiot into using it. Those who make music should just wait for FLStudio mobile to port from apple.
__label__1 I like how I change the tones it like having your own music center. Somewhat like a keyboard you will love it
__label__1 After extensively searching the Android Market for sequencers, I found the demo versions of this and RD3. I've played around with them for a while and I was about to buy them both, when this showed up for free on Amazon. Perfect!As for the low-star revie
__label__1 this app has clean graphics, works as advertised. pretty fun and interesting application. not sure whats wrong with the other ppl giving it low ratings  its a five star app,
__label__1 love it completely. more than I could've asked for. blah blah blah blah blah blah blah oh and I'm first today!
__label__1 Unfortunately you cannot download it from the Amazon App store, but get jar dot com has the current version available for download. This has replaced my kindle's default launcher, and I set up the kindle launcher for books in the toolbar. It really shows

__label__0 Can't load it or try it, would have been nice to be able to customize my Fire, Maybe they will come out with an app later that will let you do that.
__label__0 don't like it.....got rid of it.......never really could figure it all out.........I guess if you can then that's great......end of review....
__label__1 Please note this is not available in the Amazon App Store but it can be downloaded by simply using the Kindle Fire browser and going to the GO Launcher EX web site and downloading the .apk file.  There are many other ways to get it.This app is so far sup
__label__1 I've tried them all, and this is number one. So many things to customize! It's crazy and as good as LauncherPro plus. You won't regret it! This app is easily worth 5 bucks.Also, look into rooting your phone and Google &quot;supercharging&quot; it. I high
__label__0 I was looking for a good launcher and this looked like the best one. Unfortunately it is not Kindle compatable.
__label__0 If you have a fire don't get this app... you will regret it.  NA  JK  it doesn't work on the fire so do what you want.  It will be just there and it will do nothing.  So get don't get it, your choice it just wont work on the Fire... Next
__label__1 I cannot in good faith recommend getting it from Amazon. The devs of this app update it regularly, and Amazon is notoriously TERRIBLE about updating. If Amazon was on the ball as far as updating their apps go, this would be a great download via amazon, b
__label__1 Best launcher I've tried. Lots of free themes to choose from. I use the stock them which could use some more icons but that would be my only complaint.  Software runs smoothly and is stutter free. Highly recommended for any one who wants to tinker with s
__label__1 If I could give it more than 5 stars...I would! I love every aspect of this app. My tablet is running on Gingerbread (2.3) and this app allows me to do everything I wished I could do with the normal/native launcher. Add apps to the dock...add MULTIPLE do
__label__0 Splashy, yes, but too bulky for my tastes. Tried to do a lot more than I need. I scrapped it soon after I tried it.
__label__1 Go Launcher EX is highly customizable, easy to use and has lots of fun and unique themes. i've been using for months now and i love it. I also use Go Sms, and some of the Go Widgets. I highly recommend. Thunderbolt!
__label__1 When I first got my Lenovo Ideapad K1, it really was limited.  I could not use the interface because it was crashing several times a session.  Go Launcher EX got my tablet working like it should be.  I was/am ecstatic that this product just worked and wo
__label__0 I downloaded this twice but it never showed up. I searched the APP store for it but to no avail.
__label__1 My Samsung Mesmerize used to have horrible battery life - 6 hours of medium level use. I read a post on the Mesmerize Facebook page where someone with a similar problem suggested switching to Go Launcher Ex. I installed and it worked. I now regularly get
__label__1 Fast,  stable and has a tab for recently used Apps enough said...I have tried several other launchers and this is my favorite after launcher 7.
__label__1 works great on my nook tablet.  Gave it the real tablet experiance with very little effort.  No need to root.  No swapping of SD cards.
__label__1 I have a rooted Nook Tablet 1st gen running Gingerbread. I have heard good things about this app and decided to try it. It works well and has a nice customizable layout.
__label__1 Free, customizable, up to 9 pages, easier to delete and uninstall apps, built in task manager, why havent you downloaded this already? Tip... dl the page importer app to keep all your pages the same as already on your phone (ie app shortcuts.) Nearly wit
__label__0 His app stinks because it takes up all your internal storage and you cant deonload anymore music or stuff that needs to be saved on your games it just forgets everything.
__label__1 When my hero's sense UI started the HTC.bgp.com force close error, this lil guy swooped in on its' valiant steed to the rescue the damsel in distress, me. it allowed me to bypass a lot of configs that, without it, would've made it impossible to utilize. 
__label__1 On a daily basis I use SugarSync with both my mobile phone and desktop app's-- for business and personal use.  The app is great because I can upload (or download) various files, pictures, music, video and even big Photoshop and Illustrator files.Recently
__label__1 I could not get drop box or drive  to sync on my new kindle fire so I was  pleased when I found  this app. Not that much storage for free but it should be okay for what I need.
__label__1 This is a FANTASTIC piece of software.  A must if you want your documents, pictures, etc. portable.  Automatically backs up pics from phone.  Gives you 2.5x the space of dropbox and has more functionality.  Just as easy to use as dropbox.  Makes shifting
__label__1 loved old sugar sync. I did like seeing each of my synced computers and the different folders in the old Sugarsync and I was a little confused with the new SS;but it is so intuitive and works so well. An absolute genius developed this. Absolutely love it
__label__1 Works well! It syncs up your desktop, kindle, iphone and all that in lickety-split time. Share your photos of scabs and old tacos.
__label__1 great app except for a few things. sugar sync has all of the documents you would have on your computer right at your finger tips. I am a sugar sync member with a 1 terabite account with I could not surivive without it. I will type all of my projects on t
__label__0 This used to be a good service, but now they are charging for even the smallest amount of use.  AVOID.
__label__1 Works as described. Easy to use interface. App runs completely independent of a PC.  It's actually more functional then dropbox.
__label__1 When at your desktop drag photos or folders into the SugarSync app and then when you have opened your Kindle you will find your items. For photos a little menu pops up at the bottom saying &#34;Open In&#34; and then you select Photos and there you can se
__label__0 Not the least bit user friendly...Pain in the rear to understand...I hate it! Unless you are pretty tech savy don't waste your time!
__label__1 I have tried box, dropbox, wuala, asus and sugarsync. We signed up for Sugarsync initially because it gives you more free storage than the others. Plus, it gives you more free storage for each new referral.I have been very pleased with their customer sup
__label__0 I thought this was a game it had a mowing bird on it what can u expect from these apps?!
__label__1 It synced everything between my PC, iPad, iPhone, and Kindle Fire.  It's a great app to have for all of my devices.
__label__1 My wife can use her tablet to look up pics without having to download from the computer.  This is an easy way for my wife to view photos on her Kindle.
__label__1 As a cloud disaster service, sugarsync it's the best one. 5giga byte of storage plus wonderful windows client.And the android client is the must complete I've ever tried.
__label__1 I have tried many different online storage software's and apps and this one I have found to work the best and very easy to use.I have all my computers and tablet synced together without any problems.
__label__1 I have an old tablet running an ancient version of the Android OS so my device isn't supported on Google Play. I use SugarSync on my desktop and my mobile phone. So when I saw this app in the Amazon app store, I had to give it try. IT WORKS FLAWLESSLY!!!
__label__1 great recipes and no silly developer ratings. can&apos;t wait to try some of these. wish Amazon didn&apos;t require 20 words.\n
__label__0 I don't understand people who just slap an app together, mark it for a few bucks, and then release it on the wild. There isn't anything in here that is worthwhile to hold on to. I find that using this new invention called "The Internet" is a lot better w
__label__0 No recipes come up. Just pictures. It looks like there is a wide variety here; just no info coming up.
__label__0 This is to counter all the fake five star reviews. Also to laugh at the sad morons that post and rate highly to counter honest opinions when their opinions and intentions have nothing to do with the app. Silly little people with nothing better to do with
__label__0 terrible to navigate. Very vague instructions. If You are new to grilling this app is terrible. and its not great if You grill a lot. all together its just bad.
__label__0 Poor navigation, nonspecific cooking directions.\n\nThere are better cook book apps out there that are free. Save your time and money by not downloading this.
__label__1 Everyday every app.. Certain People come on here and 1 star each application. Its worse each day that goes by. Gets old.
__label__0 It doesn&apos;t really give you info on heart control etc and the directions aren&apos;t that clear either. If you are inexperienced you are better of googling questions. If you are a pro, then why are you doing reading this? Lol
__label__0 &quot;Preheat the grill&quot; is about the most useless instruction for something that&apos;s supposed to help you grill something you&apos;ve never made before.  Temperature is important information,  but nowhere to be found. \nThe UI is also quite horr
__label__0 I'm not even sure when I got this, but I know I removed it pretty quick.  Not what I was looking for.
__label__0 I am surprised by Amazon for putting this very poor app as faotd. It does not give proper instructions and leaves room for alot of guesswork. Pathetic!
__label__0 The UI for this was so bad I couldn&apos;t stand to look for anything to try. Normally I give an app more time to mess with but just couldn&apos;t with this one.
__label__1 I don&apos;t know what the complaint is for.  Great app! Easy to follow simple recipes. Also... What bother giving stars if you aren&apos;t  even going to give a legit review?
__label__1 i bbq all the time. it great to get some new recipes. the pics look yummy and the recipes seem fairly easy. TY Amazon &amp; developers!!
__label__0 Very poorly designed app. If you need this to bbq then you shouldnt be grilling at all. Poor recipes and presentation.
__label__0 ...to counter the idiot who assumes all the poor reviews are from 13-year-olds, and who admitted he wasn&apos;t even going to try the app. \nPeople, give the apps a try before you review, and please, give honest reviews, not spin control. \nThat said, I 
__label__0 poorly designed interface, awful recipes that are extremely generic, the chumichuri steak recipe is wrong as well, too few herbs in it.
__label__1 not a half bad app, doesnt have that many recipies yet, hope they add more,  nice interface, kinda basic but still nice to look atx and the pictures of the food looks great. like another reviewer said i wish amazon would change the age for reviewing apps
__label__0 Cmon! A kindle does that to fyi. All you have to do is go to settings next to the battery, and then climb on it and then click Sicily.DUH!!!!!!!!
__label__1 I love it. It works very well on my tablet. Even when I go places that is not near my WIFI. These types of apps is what I am looking for. The majority of apps that I have downloaded do not work very well and I would like to know why because I pay for a l
__label__0 This game is not like other bingo games. it is boring and stupid. There is no challenge to winning the game. Who wants to play a bingo game when all the numbers are basically the same.
__label__0 It is a ridiculous way to expect anyone to play bingo, few choices, and absolutely NO bingos! I uninstalled it after about 2 hours of disgusted play. I will think twice when chosing app companies in the future.
__label__0 How to you uninstall this thing? it is too small to even see.  I don't know what this app is doing.  not playing Bingo that's for sure.
__label__1 the only reason i gave it fivestars is that everyone else gave it one star im different im crazy haha im so silly
__label__0 This app makes no sense, and  is poorly explained.  You can figure out how to change gam playw, anr how to print out the bingo cards, but I can't figure out how to play this app on my phone and tablet.  Lame.  I should have listened to the other reviews,
__label__0 Don't even know how to use it.  Need some instructions. All I want is a Bingo game I can get into and play, even agains the computer.Bingo Live for IPad is a good example.
__label__0 ding thats messed up everyone rated it 1 star the only reason i rated it 1 star is so this game will have a record of 1 star lol - royal swag always and my name is copyrighted I will sue
__label__0 I was hoping, in spite of the low reviews, that I could figure this app out & possibly have a little Bingo fun! No such luck. I should have trusted the other reviewers & just kept searching for something better.Did developers really think the average per
__label__1 moms loves bingo
__label__1 I am an avid second life user and this app allows me to sign in and talk to friends there where ever I am!!
__label__0 This app is not free.  Free to download then try to log in and you have a monthly subscription for &quot;maintance&quot; fees.  False Advertising, better off getting the new 3D viewer and apending $3 once instead of a minimum of 250L a month, almost a we
__label__1 This ap is great for sending messages on the run. Don't expect to be able to do too much with it, but use it for what it shines at, which is sending a receiving messages.
__label__1 I have been hoping for a way to access SL from my Fire the whole time I have had my Fire, so was thrilled to finally have a mobile SL client for it.  It works great as a light chat client for SL, with a few added features, and the prices $L250 or $L450 a
__label__0 installed app put in my location and selected what I wanted and I heard nothing. exited and did it again still heard nothing. I uninstall. Droid x
__label__1 Outsiding application. It has plenty of stations to keep you busy.quality is great but is depending on the feed from the provider.This is a great app.You don't have a scanner yet try this one first.
__label__0 I downloaded, uninstalled, and downloaded again but it still didn't work. I had a real scanner in the room, and there was action but this app was totally silent. Useless.
__label__0 This crap doesnt even work alot of the people who said the same n more are so right all I get is some error message but it doesnt say error it says somthin diffent but I know from the way it comes up / typed out
__label__1 this is cool to have real informative.  A bit of lag, but get enjoyable, extremely useful if you're nosy or just curious
__label__1 just to offset the idiot who is mad at the Amazon app store. I dont even feel like elaborating on your stupidity..
__label__0 Downloaded and have yet to be able to get it to work. I tried just about every option for WA and nothing. Uninstalled- Droid X
__label__0 I thought this would be cool. :  No sound or anything. Not even static. I am going to uninstall. I have a droid x.
__label__1 It really work. I live on the rough side of town and like to be informed before  anyone else. So I listen often.
__label__1 i like to play the Jacks or better. the pace is just right for me. many hours have passed playing wile waiting for husband's appointments. I do reccomend this game.
__label__1 This  is one of the fairesst JorB pokergames I have ever played. If youknow the straagies for the proper way to play,you can be a winner!!
__label__0 boring not worth the time to play it
__label__1 This app is very nice. First it makes you laugh and that is awesome, second its nice because u have so much fun with it so you get to controll it. Its very fun for children and adults! You should totally buy this app!:)
__label__0 This app sucks and is a toltal rip off. there are no funny ones at all and I crack up over almost everything!
__label__0 I thought that it was going to be great?! but no way! horrible! I advise you not to get it:)
__label__0 I meen I haven't even got this app...seriously it already looks stupid really ...really...I.mean come on you can do better
__label__1 This app isn't as bad as you might think. Get it and maybe you will like it. my opinion is that its a great app! &#8539; of people like this app. lets turn it to &#8532; or 1 whole!
__label__0 I wish that I could get the weird things out of my head I deleted it 2 weeks ago and I 'm still having nightmares
__label__0 Usually I don't listen to reviews but I wish I had now. This app is so stupid and lame and 99% of the ringtones aren't even funny. Its just a waste of app space I wish I didn't get it.TT-TT
__label__0 I thought some of these ringtones might be funny to others when they heard them, less the vulgar ones. The problem with this app is they pretty much want permission to take over your phone. For that reason alone it was enough for me to delete it and give
__label__1 I really like it! idk y all the hate g g g Yggdrasil g v v v b b b b v v v v
__label__0 Take a look at those before you download any app.  Write(but not read) to my phone, see my contacts?  Come on.
__label__0 this app.has no funny factor, and all the stuff is the same. if the made some creative stuff then I would consider not calling the worst in the world. it really sucked
__label__0 It would not download.  I have no idea if the ringtones were any good or not.  So far I am 0 for 2 on FREE ringtone apps from Amazon.
__label__0 do not and I repeat do not get this app...take my word for it....or learn the hard way and get the app only to uninstall it...
__label__0 I know this is something for the person who wants to be cute and freak people out but this program did not entertain me much at all.  Didn't care for it, wasn't very realistic.
__label__0 I downloaded this because my boss...well, he's a boy.  He likes stuff like this.  The selection wasn't very good and the selection they did have, sounded the same...over and over and over and over.
__label__1 I rarely give reviews, but this app just saved my ease of mind, because I couldn't get rid of lets golf 3 and couldn't get advice anywhere. after loading this, that 850MB download was gone in less than 2 minutes. thank you adisasta!
__label__0 This doesn't work. I think it is because you need flash player and that has been taken off tablets with no alternative available. I thought that this might just be my product, but hear that even the i-products are not getting it anymore. I thought that t
__label__1 I am very satisfied with this product for my Chromo PC Tablet and the app works quite well within recommendations.
__label__1 This app helps me keep track off all of my apps I would recoomand this app who likes to keep track of everything.
__label__0 I used this program for a few minutes and didn't understand what it does. I personally like ES File Explorer 10 times more.
__label__0 I really did not care about ths product because it was not user friendly. I found other programs that were much better.
__label__1 I found this app early on in the learning curve with my Ainol Novo 7 tablet with Android 4.01 (Ice Cream Sandwich). Being new to the Android platform, the first four days with it were frustrating. Once I learned most of the nuances of working with AndroX
__label__1 Have not seen this tool used but my son says it works well, and he can now find things on his Kindle that were hard to find.
__label__1 Best utility I ever used for my Kindle Fire HD. I love how I can manage my apps right at my finger tips!!
__label__1 easy to use and find files on kindle fire.  works great for my needs. easy to copy and paste to different folders.
__label__1 This is great.  You can find all the files in every directory or folder your looking for.  You can do everything you can on a PC.  I highly recommend it.
__label__1 Will let you browse your device's file structure and the network you are connected to (if there are any servers connected to the network).  Exactly what I was looking for.
__label__1 Works fine on my samsung 3 phone. no problems seen so far. And have friends using this also with no problems.
__label__0 Nothing to compare with ES File Explorer, too many folders which is shouldn't be there, I don't understand how use this app. So I will delete from cloud too. But I appreciate your work anyway.
__label__1 before downloading this app I would save files to my kindle fire and never be able to find them. this app allows me to find, open, and organize all files. very essential for kindle fire owners. A++
__label__1 For doing multiple file operations particularly useful for jailbroken kindle fires which are customized android tablets in reality. A little practice is required to use it effectively.
__label__0 it doesn't work on my kindle fire hd 8.9 it says its compatible but it is not so I took it off
__label__1 works great nice to have and easy to use, auto matic to sd card when downloading  need 4 more words
__label__1 I have added this app to every device in my household. Everything you need all in one convenient place. Highly recommend.
__label__1 This app works very well for me.  i hope the &quot;move to SD card&quot; problem is fixed.  even with that bug, the one button maximize function is great.  saves me lots of time.  i recommend this app.
__label__1 It does what it says. Easily close apps and software running in the background so the app or program you are using runs better / faster.
__label__1 This is the best App Manger out there by far... this one can do it all... Apps 2 SD, Task Manager, Backup, Unistaller, and Cache Cleaner.. this is amazing.. it even has mini Add-on apps to compliment it by adding widgets so you don't have to go into the 
__label__0 I hated getting reminded to &quot;donate&quot; every time I used this app, so I forked over the 3.99. It worked for a while, but for no reason, it started showing ads and asking me to donate again.I emailed the developer, and he told me to go to the dona
__label__0 Did not care for this app, no special reason, just did not like it. Didn't like the features or the way it worked. I found a much better app to organize my apps on my Kindle Fire HD.
__label__0 Don't need. Went to site by mistake. Sorry 1star because it wasn't  useful for me. Went to it to work on an app that I needed.
__label__1 I love this app! I'm running it on my Kindle Fire, and it allows me to kill the processes of things that would normally run in the background online when I'm offline and don't need them running (like my weather app, Words With Friends, etc.). You'd be su
__label__1 I highly recommend Gemini App Manager to absolutely everyone!  Knowing what your aps have access to at-a-glance is great.  Batch actions are very handy, too.  LOVE IT!
__label__1 Yes, much of the functionality exists elsewhere within Android or other apps, but to have all the options here in one place is very convenient.Normal mode gives you a clear list of what is taking up memory, what is currently running, what is on the SD ca
__label__1 I like this App Manager, its the first I've used so I can't ocmpare it to anything. It works well, does what its intended, and I haven't had any issues with it thus far.
__label__1 this app is amazing! I love the amount of tools avaliable in only one FREE app, they could charge a lot for this (which I hope they won't. do though)works. great and helps keep my kindle fire in great shape! I just hope they would add a disk defragmenter
__label__1 After cycling through a plethora of task killers, I found Gemini dominates the competition. Lots of features and a solid and well polished GUI make this app a must have for your Android device.
__label__1 This is the best app manager out there on the market today. Works excellently on Android phones and has most functionality on tablets. Would be excellent if tablets had the same function features as the phones, like moving to external sd card. All in all
__label__1 Tried others but this my favorite.Stops most apps just like it is supposed to. It is so quick and easy to use, but can be customized for tight control if wanted.
__label__1 It has been updated as of late to include more icons and VERY detailed explanations (and it has an EXIT button!)I have been using this app, as well as the widget, for years now. With a rooted phone this app allows you to modify apps so they don't startup
__label__0 Not only doesn't this do what it said it did, it doesn't list but a few of the apps I have on my Fire. I'm very disappointed and now have to try to figure out how to uninstall it.
__label__1 On any android device you need to have app manager that can kill the processes that keep running in the background.  If you don't, you'll soon have so little ram left available that system performance will be significantly degraded.  This app does a pret
__label__1 Works really well to control apps that want to run all the time in the background and eat up ram. Especially on my little Vortex.
__label__1 This app is not just for rooted phones. If you install a new app that can be moved to your sd card it sends you a notification, which takes you right to the screen to move it. No app out right now can "kill" an app installed by your carrier without rooti
__label__1 Almost impossible to imagine why this type of app wasnt part of the OS but since it wasn't, this is the best app of the 4 I tried.
__label__0 This app caused my Kindle Fire HD to crash and reboot constantly after I installed it.  Once I uninstalled it I didn't have any more problems.
__label__1 I have only used this app a short while, but have found it easy to use and very helpful on my fire.
__label__1 Most welcome addition. Does what it is supposed to and does it well. No conflicts of any kind. Thanks for the hard work.
__label__1 There are other features in this app manager that I don't use, so I can't provide a full review, but for simple killing apps that don't have their own exit button, and the &#34;one touch&#34; cleanup everything is nice, depending on what I am doing - I g
__label__1 I've had three Kindle tech's hang up because I wanted to know why my two gigabytes of ram was 95% used.With Gemini in expert mode I saw that all the red color app's were ram.I ran an app and closed it. Going to Gemini I found the app was still using ram.
__label__1 This app has everything in one place.  Easy to use and great functionality for your device.  App is free, upgrading helps the developers to make this product even better.
__label__1 does what it says and does it fast. actually kills apps unlike most task killers that claim to stop a application.
__label__0 I downloaded this app and never even used it. I Che Jed it out a few times,but never used it and need upmuninstalling it!
__label__1 Without a doubt, this is possibly one of the best little utility apps you can get for your Kindle.  Since knowing exactly what programs are running and what your RAM is being used up by is not easily known on a Kindle, I tried this application out and fi
__label__1 This a very utilitarian app for making sure that there are no apps running in the background eating up your battery charge
__label__1 Ridiculously useful app! I can't imagine my kindle fire without it. I use it for force closing apps to free up memory, and to quickly and easily browse through all my apps to see how much memory each takes up and if it's worth it for me to bring it along
__label__1 With this app I was able to clear my cache. It cleared my application storage because when I intsalled app and uninstalled them some of the data wasn't earased with the app and that took up a lot of space in my application storage.With this app I cleared
__label__1 This is a powerful little tool that puts everything right at your fingertips. it makes managing all your apps so much easier. Love it!
__label__1 I am so glad I downloaded this.  This allows me to get rid of apps that I have gotten tired of or downloaded on accident.  Super easy to use too, as soon as a new app is downloaded I get a pop up from this app saying it is stored.
__label__1 My Fire was getting slower and slower. Kill all your useless background stuff and the carousel acts just like day one. I had no idea so many apps were running as sub routines.
__label__1 This has the word &laquo;developer&raquo; in the beginning of its des ription, but that didn't put me off -- this is not a beta version -- you are going to get a full alpha application.Install is a snap and so far I am getting good insight into my CPU an
__label__0 I like the app well enough but after I donated to pay tribute to the Dev and get ads removed I still have ads.I've sent multiple emails to Dev that have gone unanswered. Pissed off and not feeling the love. I will be contacting Amazon for help.
__label__1 Gemini App Manager has certainly helped me out on finding &quot;data-hogging&quot; files and apps.  The ability to customize your searches and 'when kindle has a micro card's to move data to the sdcard has been very helpful on the Android phone.  Now mak
__label__1 This has to be one of the best apps for my tablet, Creative ZiiO 7.  It's very reliable, opens quickly, and lists all currently running apps (along with important stats, such as the amount of RAM being used by each app).  The best part ... with one butto
__label__1 This is one of, if not the best app manager available for Android.  It loads apps up very quickly, not a big lag when you start it.  The app icons are clear and large enough to actually see, which helps locate apps a little more easily.  The task killer 
__label__1 Works well, nice design and happy with production, it's free and feel it is worth the try. Thank You Very Much!
__label__0 Has potential-- but clearing the full page adds every 10seconds.... doesn't allow you to realize that potential...uninstall on principal... a shame... because the file list by size is valuable to this reviewer.
__label__1 If your app killer kills an app and the app comes back on, that has nothing to do with the app killer. The app is programmed to come back on. You&apos;d need to change a setting in your app if you can but a lot of apps won&apos;t let you change it. Those
__label__1 Useful app, even though I'm not a huge power User.  I use it mainly to kill apps I am done with to free up memory.  My Kindle Fire doesn't take an SD card so this is very useful.  Not having unwanted apps still holding memory seems to help battery life.
__label__1 I am a fan.  Love the app and would recommend to others.  It helps me manage apps.  Simple enough.  What else can I say?
__label__1 allows you to review and manage your apps very easily. very useful app, highly recommended. matter of fact, i think it is a must have app.
__label__1 Great product, especially if you are on a rooted device. Which I always Root everything, not recommended for novice. To Root that is. But this app manager is a good one rooted or not.
__label__1 This app is great! It helps me with all of my other apps when they are having issues. A wonderful app!
__label__1 I&apos;ve used this app mostly to kill apps, but have used it for a couple other things. I&apos;ve had no problems with it, but will update this if I do.\n
__label__1 quick and easy way to free up resources. easy install. easy to run. no brainer. anyone can see the differences.
__label__1 Excellent tool for keeping track of apps and their impact on system resources. I always run it and use it frequently.
__label__1 any android device should have an app killer on it but the Gemini app manager does that and so much more,  FOR FREE! does a great job and is easy to use.
__label__1 I'm constantly on my kindle, so it's fabulous to be able to ensure I only have one app going at a time.  Gemini kills all throw apps I'm not using, freeing up memory for my currant app, which means faster response time and saves on power being used by my
__label__0 uninstalled much better apps out there that do the job much better.  Good try maybe next time they will get it right. LOL
__label__1 My favorite feature of this app is that I can clear the cache on ALL my apps at the touch of one button! That feature alone saves a lot of time as well as memory. My only problem with this app is that my phone freezes when I use it to delete apps, but th
__label__1 From my extended use of every application &amp; program management tool available for android based phones I've concluded that this is the best by far. It's very extensive and contains everything plus more that you will ever need. 5 out of 5 hands down!
__label__1 This app is a must have for those like me have too many apps.  The app manager lets you see which apps are a keeper and which ones won't be missed.  I love Gemini App Manager and if you're looking for a good app manager you will too!
__label__1 I have tried many task killer apps and battery saver apps and most of them didn't work or pretended to work. This app lets you pick what you want to kill that's running, or hit one button and it kills everything but your important apps. With one button i
__label__0 Beware, this app froze my entire phone and I had to reset EVERYTHING!!  No not download unless you want to ruin your phone and all your memories you have saved in it.
__label__1 This was one of the first apps I downloaded for my EVO 3D. It is an incredibly useful all-in-one Swiss army knife of an app. The batch action feature is awesome for killing multiple tasks at once or moving multiple apps to your SD card. You can even do b
__label__1 I've actually been recommending this to some of my tablet owning friends. Usually that's not something I like to do since they're far more tech savy than me. But this app is just too useful not to spread the word, just get it ;-).
__label__1 Absolutely no issues, and lots of benefits.  Makes my Kindle fire work faster when used regularly. Using the cache clearer alone will make anyone's device function better.  Absolutely fantastic.
__label__1 I use this application to close out my other apps. It works great and is timely and efficient. Thanks Gemini!
__label__1 This is a very handy app.  However if you get it thru the Android market it crashes all the time.  I have no problem with the one I get thru Amazon.  Recommended.
__label__1 I love it it shows nerby theaters,gas stations  and people it great for if you ned to know someones phone number and stuff its free why not  get it&iexcl;!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
__label__0 Downloaded this app. Tried to open it three times. Each time, it force closed on me. Uninstalled, and I lived happily ever after.
__label__1 I didnt download this app from Amazon, rather i grab it from the Android Market.  Regardless of where i got it, this app is awesome.  I used it before on my blackberry and loved the ability to look up numbers for restaurants to call ahead, find out whats
__label__1 This is truly a MUST have for anyone that drives, eats out,  goes to the movies, or is looking for just about any person,  place,  or thing to do.  i recommend this to every smart phone customer I have.  not one hasn't thanked me later for it.
__label__1 Quick download to my kindle fire hd. At first it didn't work as described. Any a note to company and they responded they were fixing it. They came through and now it works as advertised.  Good app to quickly find information on places and things. Keep it
__label__1 I have use this app for years both at home and away from home. It's an easy way to check movie times, restaurants, businesses, the weather, look up names and addresses of people and much more, including gas prices.Everything is logically organized and ea
__label__1 It has everything you need in terms of finding movies, food, gas prices etc. Even local shops are listed if you forgot a number to your favorite sandwich place. It's indispensable.
__label__1 Wow! My images come up fast and clear. I have been using it for a week and have no complaints. Can't get better than free...
__label__0 works great for viewing tif files but prompts to buy after converting to PDF 4 times.....no problem. I want to buy it but can not find the paid version on the amazon market!  please make available on the amazon market.
__label__1 For my Kindle Fire, I was looking for a media application that would display and run animated GIF images. Not only does this free app do that, it does it well, displays a multitude of image formats and has some other nice features as well. So far, I have
__label__1 This app is a fast track to view pictures and movies. Very nice file structure with thumbnails. Animated Gifs even display nicely in full size, even the thumbs are animated. I would have paid for this app.
__label__1 Very fast way to browse through photos. I like the way it shows the photo information next to each thumbnail on the list-page instead of having to open each picture and then pull up the details from there. works perextly on my Kindle Fire.
__label__1 Great way to keep my recipes handy and I have tried some and were very good.  Very convenient to  have it so handy when I am shopping for ingredients and when I am cooking to have the recipes handy.
__label__0 Allows an application to receive messages?  what application?  Read User Contacts?  what for?  too many answers needed for questions that should not need to be asked.  No thank you, guess I will try groceryiq.
__label__1 I have yet to use this app for store shopping but love it for the recipe box. I mo longer have to search the entire internet for a new recipe or twist on my own recipe. Just put in a keyword such as chicken and stream through pages of recipes. There is a
__label__1 ZipList is very handy and I really use it a lot!  It is on my phone so I pull up a recipe at the store. It creates a shopping list for you.  I recommend to everyone who loves to cook!
__label__1 Love the way it creates a category so it makes shopping in each department a breeze.  No back and forth to the different isles when shopping!
__label__0 $1.99 doesn't break the bank but COME ON! This app does nothing but frustrate me! It does not work in any way shape or form. I want me money back.....
__label__0 This app is a huge waste of time I know its hard to make an app but maybe upgrade it to be more efficient
__label__0 I almost never buy apps....now I remember why! No instructions. No support. No way to get a refund for something that is ridiculously far from what is described/advertised. I have done photo work professionally in the past and thought this sounded like f
__label__0 I can't even explain how disappointed I was......  the test drive was dun and it worked and then I got to the real app and it just sucked!
__label__1 This app totally works! It took me a month to figure it out but I'm still amazed. What most of the other reviewers said is not at all true! It really works. What you need to do is press start new session and then color what you want colored. It won't sho
__label__0 Not a very good app.I thought it would be interesting to have this app but I was so wrong. It stopped working right away. Very disapointing!!
__label__0 I just got this app. I can not get it to work, Yes I can draw on my picture but fit an app you payed fot that is not worth it. I was hoping to do black and white with btight colors. It only gives you a few options. I was not able to do anything on this. 
__label__1 I absolutely LOVE this app! Works great on Kindle Fire. You have the ability to Color only certain things in a photo you have on your device. This app is a must have for creative photo takers!!!!!
__label__0 I love playing with pictures. This app made me hate it.First of all I have a Kindle Fire, pretty big screen, not like a phone screen. Every time I tried to zoom the picture, it completly disappeared. Then using my pinky tried to color in, but pinky to fa
__label__0 Should be free isn't worth it. I wouldn't buy it if I were you. I regret it! DO NOT BUY!
__label__0 I really excited to use this app, but when I opened it and uploaded a photo I couldn't use it, there are no instructions, I tried everything I could to make my photo black and white and then make certain parts of the photo in color it wouldn't work. Of c
__label__1 I found this by accident, but once found, I appreciated it. You can find videos and tutorials around the &#34;net&#34; to help you fix and repair your bike. This is one you can carry on the road - for when you REALLY need it.
__label__1 I find the app to contain useful information for my needs. Just getting back into mt. biking after a few years and forgot maintenance routines etc. Shows fundamentals and helps in trouble shooting. At sale price I definitely recommend.
__label__1 This app has come in handy several times and has already saved me money.  It is well layed out and I think it is easy to navigate.
__label__1 While perhaps not perfect and complete as per some reviewers, This would give a lot of people the confidence to start a repair. Once started, most people can figure things out for themselves.The app is nicely illustrated and arranged.
__label__1 I've had new pain in my knees and then my chain began skipping. I found  troubleshooting and resolution easily here. It also provides guidance for safety and maintenance. $2.00 more for this approach at Apple.
__label__0 was wondering why my smart keyboard wa vibrating vs entering what I was typing.  also launcher pro bottom left button was not responding since it's in the launh zone.
__label__1 this app is great.onetwothreefourfivesixseveneightnineteni have to 20 words in order to post why not sure
__label__0 This app caused me to have to factory reset and do an extended battery pull before my phone worked right again. It totally threw off my calibrations,  barely click on anything... it took me a whole hour just to get through the menus and get to the uninst
__label__1 Great idea for an app.  I love that the devs made it so configureable.  On the Xoom, the default gesture location is a bit in the way, but they made it so that you can put the little hot spot damn near anywhere you want.  I only wish there were additiona
__label__1 Currently, I am using it to keep my favorite games handy. It is very customizable. One of my favorite apps. I've never had any problems with it all.
__label__1 I have a tbolt so I can long press and get my apps. but! you can set the icons in wave launcher to quick dial any one of your contacts. That is extremely useful.  Completely customizable. Love it!
__label__1 This app, by far, surpasses it's inspiration. It so awsome that I even paid full price for it. (FYI- I do not like to spend money) Anyone who is with Palm's WebOS would agree that this app takes Android beyond any other OS, and I mean any. This should be
__label__1 people are morons lol. people are really rating an app One star just because THEY don't need it? text plus has been around for a long time, i use it on my iPad and now on my g tablet. it gives you a free number on your WiFi only devices to text from.  th
__label__1 ahhhh sweet memories of my Palm. Well almost. This application is prety cool. So easy to set up and so easy to use. What's next, cards like the Palm? i would be just fine with that!
__label__0 So I decided to try this since it was the Amazon free app of the day.Got it installed, and messed around with the settings then all of a sudden my phone rebooted and then locked up during the boot process, had to pull the battery, try again.  Still no go
__label__0 Thought phone had a virus. Spacebar started working one out of 10 times. Then realized ALL bottom row keys worked only if press tiny top edge of button. WAVE keeps trying to launch when I'm texting or writing email. Uninstalling immediately.
__label__1 I loaded this app on my EVO and was immediately impressed. After updating the apps I wanted to load, it works amazingly.  This freed up some room on my home screen, but kept my frequently used programs accessible.
__label__1 This app is extra useful, allows a quick way to access my most used apps from any other app. Great for switching between apps on the fly or pulling up my calendar while reading my email then switching back. Great customization, with minimal intrusion. Ma
__label__1 I love this app because it makes so many apps accessible on any page. I do wish it was a tiny bit less sensitive. Still, even with that I love this app and I think it is a must have for all Android users. This takes one of the few advantages from the Web
__label__1 This app is a steal for free. I'd be willing to pay the 99&cent; for it even if it wasn't free app of the day. I love how much you can customize it. Get it while it's hot!
__label__1 Awesome app! Love it :-) wasn't sure at first but now that I've had the chance to use it for a while I love it.
__label__0 Crap app. Stay away from this one. All it does is kill your battery as it is constantly running in the background. Also slows your phone down as well. Setting it up is also very difficult. Again, a waste of money.
__label__0 Tried all the settings and tweaks, but it doesn't seem to work on my Xoom, and maybe any Honeycomb tablet?
__label__1 Works great on my Epic 4g.  I press on the Samsung logo below the screen to trigger the wave, so it doesn't interfere with anythingSome users report it messing with their keyboard though, so apparently not all phones can utilize this effectively.
__label__1 I didn't think I would like this app, but as soon as I installed it I saw its potential. Works well, easy to configure and comes in rather handy. Well worth getting.
__label__0 It's fun while it lasts, sure. Out of nowhere, I don't even recall if I had used it right before, the blurred background thing comes up and covers my phone completely. I had to uninstall and do a battery pull to get it to work. (It's so incredibly diffic
__label__0 no good for HTC phones, doesn't work well with the home screen set up. when you try and use it, your apps on the home screen block it. also it can only launch 5 apps, the home screen holds more than that itself not including the separate pages you can sw
__label__1 I really like launchers, the kind that work with your home screen (different from home screen replacements, HSRs).Wave Launcher is among the best.I like the interface, stylish and fun...but still easy to use.To make it even better, I recommend the develo
__label__1 i love this app activation and graphics are nice please add more room for shortcuts. when im typing, it sometimes makes me have to hit the spacebar twice
__label__0 I think this was a text input app. It failed, whatever it was. It might have improved since I first used it about 2 years ago. But it was terrible when I used it.
__label__1 I didn't really get what this was when I first picked it up, but now that I'm using it I can't imagine my phone without it.  It is basically a quick way to get to my favorite apps easily without having to hit home first.  Since there is a handful of apps
__label__1 this is a very useful app. i really like that i can edit the area to drag from so specifically! great app.
__label__1 This has got to be my lucky day. Just this morning I was thinking about this app and how awesome it would be to get it on the Amazon Appstore for free and bam. Bringing some of that sweet webOS greatness to Android. This is not a alternative launcher it 
__label__1 I was one of the lucky ones that got this as one of the free paid app of the day, and I use this app on a daily basis it seems.  Highly customizable from the touch area size, touch area location, apps/widgets/shortcuts to choose from, to the color of the
__label__1 Love the app. :D It works great on my Tab. You just have to change the settings to make sure it wont interfere with your keyboard. Otherwise, works great.
__label__1 This is one app I would of paid for had I realized how beneficial it is. Example..you are typing an instant message but you need the calculator. If you have the calculator on your wave you can bring it up without ending your instant message. when you are
__label__1 Especially comes in handy when tweaking widget properties that don't populate in &quot;Recent&quot; list in Android (ex. Fancy Widget Pro)
__label__1 I'm not going to change the star rating, bc I still really like this app alot. But I'm annoyed that there's an update available for this app on the android market for over a month, but no update from Amazon yet. This is not the only Amazon app I've had t
__label__1 I wasa huge fan of webos and ths is one the things that I really liked about it. I must say I find it way more useful here in Android since I have so much more app wise it is a nice short cut to my more used apps.It has tons of options for you to playwit
__label__1 What a great and simple app to make life easy.  Read notes section, gives some advice on how to not have it mess with on screen keyboard.  A must!
__label__1 this app will be good to use when I am on the phone and I need to pull up my calendar.
__label__1 I love this app. Now I can access my most used or favorite apps while doing just about anything without exiting the current apps etc. Very useful. Great job developers! If only I can turn on/off my mobile data through this app, then this would be perfect
__label__0 Why would this app need to be allowed to use &quot;services that cost you money&quot; and &quot;directly call phone numbers&quot;?? I want to install this app but thats just sketchy.
__label__1 Yes, this app could be frustrating if you don't know what's going on.  However, if you educate yourself in it, and learn how to customize it, this can be one of the best shortcut apps in your arsenal.
__label__1 This is a must have app, I don't remember such a full-throated endorsement of an app by me. No more getting angry at android for not building this in to the core system. No more getting cranky at why you can't transfer easily between apps from within an 
__label__1 Great application! Interfered with my keyboard until I realized that you can customize the gesture area. Since that point I have had no problems. App is quick and allows easy access to my most-used apps!
__label__1 Now my Evo has a Web OS feel to it. Works great, easy to set up and use.  Thanks a bunch
__label__1 I love that I can not have my desktop cluttered up with all my apps but still have quick access to them. Thanks
__label__1 This app is great! Love that it can be active from the lock screen so you can go straight to any application. I kind of regret buying Widget Locker now. This does most of what I need. There are some issues with it decreasng sensitivity to buttons at the 
__label__0 how is this better or more intuitive than the already easy to use and intuitive Android app launcher? absolutely worthless.
__label__1 Took me a little while to figure out how to use it but now I'm loving this app great job to the dev
__label__1 I'm using a Sprint Samsung Epic 4G, with Android 2.2. This app saves a bit of time, but overall is just really convenient.
__label__1 this app works really well. Customization works well to place the hot spot where it works best. Very intuitive when you set it up for yourself. Glad to see the reviews that pointed this out. FULLY CUSTOMIZABLE!!! Thanks for this app!!
__label__1 I'm sold on Aldiko eBook reader. The interface is user friendly. Using the app is easy on the eyes, perfect for reading before bedtime. The download interface is easy to navigate. Filled my bookshelves in no time. I love it that it saves my place. Recomm
__label__1 Aldiko is the best e-book reader I have found for my Android phone. You can import any epub format book or download from Feedbooks, Smashwords or other online sites such as Project Guttenberg. Its ability to automatically bookmark your current page saves
__label__1 This book reader has smooth flow of pages, the best I've seen so far-and I've downloaded them all trying to find the best! Good selection of free books - many more than other readers.
__label__1 Works about the best and is a good all purpose reader. I can download any book in PDF format and it's available instantly. Don't have to load it from my computer.
__label__0 didnt like this at all. never worked when I tried it. deleted it recently cause it wouldnt work. oh well free but hated it.
__label__1 This item does everything I wanted. It do and very nicely. it is very user friendly. I wuld definately recommend this seller to anyone to do business with.
__label__1 I wish that I had got the paid/premium version. The upgrade has improved the smoothness of use, so much, that now I'd be willing to see what else it can do. I'm just an ordinary book lover/reader, not the highlighter, notetaker, academic, or author type,
__label__0 I just did not keep it had other book apps I chose to keep. Does the job if you need it.
__label__1 If you like reading and don't want a big brand interface, then this product is for you.  Nice design, easy and efficient gui. Very nice features, as well.
__label__1 Aldiko Book Reader provides a very helpful and easy to use interface. Plenty of options put it at least on a par with other book readers, if not superior overall. It downloads the books so that they can be read when offline unlike some that require an in
__label__1 Great app for reading ebooks and pdfs. Worth the price. The extra settings are useful as well, you can change the font size, colors, and brightness.
__label__0 i like my overdrive app better. this is okay but the overdrive app that i use seems to fit me.
__label__1 This works great to organize your e-books. Helpsconvert to reader format and shows books on book shelf. This is must have.
__label__1 I really love this reader! It is easy to use, responsive and quick to update! I would recommend it to anyone who wants a no nonsense reader.
__label__1 There are various versions of this excellent ebook reader around, the one I use is on an Archos 7 HT v1 which is limited to Android 1.5. I bought the Archos as an ebook reader having seen Aldiko on another android tablet. Very satisfied, never had issues
__label__1 Excellent app...i really live how easy it is to use...you can change font size and screen brightness...even change from black text with white background to white text on black background which i find much easier to read. Importing files is easy too, seve
__label__1 This app reads my galleys which I needed to be able to have in a more portable setting. On top of that it also does all the other major files I use (epub, mobi, and pdf). It's been a life saver for sure.On top of all that I found it a breeze to import my
__label__1 One of the better ereaders available.  Have used several on phone and tablets and this is by far one of the best.
__label__1 I downloaded this app for my wife after buying an Android tablet for Christmas for her. She finds it to be quite intuitive and easy to use. Epub files read well on the device using this app, where my KOBO device struggles with them for some reason.
__label__0 Can't review since I cannot find it on my Kindle Fire 7 HD although it is supposed to be shown in Apps?
__label__1 This reader has several features I like such as the ability to read PDF files and a night reading display function (a feature you don't get with the Kindle). What I don't like is its inability to read Mobipocket files.  Otherwise...5 stars.
__label__0 Not alot of selection on this one unless you like old books. would not recommend. Not knocking but not my cup of tea.
__label__1 After uninstalling the app and re-installing, it works great. At first it wasn't working and was very disappointed but after the reinstall I am happy.
__label__1 Though I don't think it's available here, aldiko sync for rooted devices is great with this app.  But even on it's on this is a great reader.  Customizable and able to use the android share feature so that you can post to facebook/google/twitter/email/et
__label__1 This is a great ebook reader. It does everything it says it does, and does it well. The best I've found.
__label__1 Awesome reader ! I use it regularly for bunch of epub books I have.  My daughter uses it to read lot of classics! Love it on my 7" ASUS tablet and 9.7" HP Touchpad!&#10004; Support EPUB which is what I use as well as pdf&#10004; Fully-customizable readin
__label__1 I use this one especially when I want to view my collection with sophisticated tags and categories.  It's a classic.
__label__1 I used to have to convert all EPUB books to MOBI in order to read them on my Kindle Fire.  With ALDIKO I can read them directly without conversion.  Great little reader.  Highly recommend
__label__1 shows ebook and pdf formats,  shows in reverse lighting (dark background and light text) .  remembers place where i stopped reading.
__label__1 You will have to go to the Aldiko web site and download it to your computer and then side load it.  I have about 600 ebooks in ePub format.  I'm not going to give up the ease of tags and other info.  This is the best program if you have a large number of
__label__1 I settled on this reader after trying about 13 others.  It is by far more usable than any of the others.  Adding books to it has a bit of a learning curve, but is still easier than any other reader I tried.
__label__1 I downloaded this app from another appstore because the product page in Amazon says it's not compatible with my Kindle Fire.  Well, it is.  I won an advance copy of a book to review from NetGalley, and it came in the form of an ascm file.  I had to downl
__label__0 this app sucks. right when I opened it it froze. this is stupid do not get this app. don't get it
__label__0 This doesn't even work!!  It shows West when you are going North and messed up on all other directions turned to.
__label__1 As a person with no internal sense of direction, I find this app very useful.  Also, seems to be accurate.
__label__0 does not work on the fire. the compass does not move when you move away for north and it does not work as a compass at all
__label__0 this thing sucks on the kindle fire Cu's it doesn't. have a gos on it. don't use this if u have a kindle fire
__label__0 I would give this piece of crap a half a star.it didn't  point me in the right direction Ever!always stayed pointed to the north,nothing else.GARBAGE!
__label__1 This is too cute and as soon as I figure out which direction that I want to go, it will definitely come in handy.
__label__0 downloaded it.  opened it. and the pointer stayed pointed in the same direction:  North by north east, no matter what direction I pointed my kindle.  Maybe not meant for my device?
__label__0 This app will show you what a compass looks like, and will change the background picture, but is NOT a functional compass.
__label__0 this app does not work on the airpad x 10.2 tablet. the app opens and then freezes. it does nothing at all.
__label__0 Requires GPS to work and Kindle does not have that. It was free so I wasn't out anything but time.
__label__0 this is an android app but does not work on the Kindle Fire - it needs a built-in GPS which the Fire doesn't have
__label__0 not good app for kindell. pretty much useless in the case of actually needing a compass. I believe amazon should get a real compass app.
__label__0 I hate Cu's my cusin said it was inaproptlreate. and it wont install on my kindle it is dumb if you are a kid don't get it if you like it then you are a gross person
__label__1 I love it know instead of saying this stuff I can press it so lucky for me now if I get in trouble I can say I didn't say it my kindle said it
__label__0 its just stupid, really, doesn't work at all, it erased all my apps on my kindle. like really. i was so angry. Don't buy!
__label__1 I really wanna buy this app but i don't want to spend money on it. I think that's why most people wont buy it.
__label__0 POS This is just my opinion and I'm writing this because in order to leave a review I must have a certain amount of words in my review. Really!!!  AYFKM. Jusy Saying.
__label__1 I think this game is awesome and totally worth it. I suggest getting this game because ithas smooth controls and is way better than most basketball games.
__label__1 This game is really addicting! I love basketball and this was the app for me. The main point of the game is to make the shots you take and get more advanced. You earn different basketballs that earn you more points. This game is RAD. Get it if you like b
__label__1 Fun & Easy game.  My youngest kids (4&8) can play and have fun just making the shots, my older son (12) plays it at a little deeper level and still enjoys the game.
__label__1 its ok it was free to try.. dont think i would purchase the game although because it doesnt have any sort of reply when u get bored and u will .. u will never play it again..
__label__1 I love this game! it works great on my kindle fire and haven't had any problems. much better than basketball shot.
__label__1 This game is great. It is a great time waster. It has smooth controlls and sounds. I REALLY, REALLY recommend this app. Have fun!!!!!!!!!!
__label__1 Great game. It is a great time killer. My five year old son loves it too! Download this fun game!
__label__1 LOOKS AWESOME ON MY K-FIRE! Too bad this is burried in the search mix when you type in calculator. Had to really search for this as it was pretty jumbled/burried in with a lot of non math calculators. Love the simple name, has both great scientific and b

__label__1 If you want to store a set of operations then calculate after hitting a button, use a different app or request this feature from the dev.  Works as intended.
__label__1 When you use this app you clearly realize that it ONLY calculates the first function you input.  It cannot disobey the order of operations because there is no possibility for entering more than one operation at a time.  If you're smart enough to know wha

__label__1 Interesting. A calculator for the app of the day. It's not like you cant get  a free one that does exactly the same thing. Still gave it 5 stars cause its a good app, just a crummy choice for app of the day.
__label__0 The equal button failed to work... All this talk about it have a special order of operations sorta reminds me of a joke by Ron White where he says, "Let me tell you what I'm looking for in a tree. I'm looking for a tree that you can tell is alive even if
__label__0 The calculator has great potential, but it it's missing parenthesis and am ability to enter an equation before calculations take place. Without those to features, all of the scientific expression buttons that appear in landscape mode are completely usele
__label__1 This calculator app has the additional functions not included with the stock android app:  memory add, memory subtract, memory clear, memory recall, and percentage. Plus it has scientific mode in landscape mode.  Enough said.
__label__1 Well a calculator is pretty much a calcuator. However, the convenience of having one on my Kindle is wonderful! Good buy!
__label__0 This is the same exact calculator that comes with the evo 4G. The only difference is you can't change color... Definitely not worth 2 dollars so you can change the color of you calculator. And I think the reviews of it not having the order down is legiti

__label__1 This is a great basic calculator and am glad it's a FAOD since I don't have one on my KF.I wish more people would just rate the app for what the description says it is and whether it works well or not instead of rating it for every thing they wish the ap
__label__1 This makes a great business calculator and is certainly an improvement over the stock calculator. I can't comment on the scientific calculator because I don't use that but the layout and function of the regular one is perfect.
__label__0 If I had bought this in a store, I would return it right away. Who wants a calculator that doesn't give correct answers? It doesn't matter about changing skins if the answers wrong now does it?5*4+2*3 is NOT 66...far from it. Do not get this for your kid
__label__0 No order of operations. It looks nice and seem to run fast but with out order of operations I can't give it anything but a 1 star.
__label__0 I would like to know what kind of drugs the developer was on putting out an app that fails at basic calculations and what kind of drugs Amazon is on for picking these free apps of the day. They have been crap lately, not worth even looking at or download
__label__1 This isn't like the built in Android calculator.  It doesn't wait for you to enter a string of operations and then obey order of operations like the other comments complain.  It works like handheld calculators, applying the operation as you type.  This i
__label__1 I love this it helps me with my math I'm up 2 grades higher than I should be so this really helps me. thankyou for making this the is the calculator I needed.
__label__0 charging for something that everyone's phone already does/has. unless I'm mistaken every phone out there that can download apps has a calculator BUILT IN! DUH, anyone that would pay for this app is an idiot and should not be allowed to procreate.
__label__0 Actually, it's worse than useless if it doesn't respect the order of operations -- it's HARMFUL if the unsuspecting user is relying on these calculations for classes or business operations.  Needs a MAJOR FIX PRONTO!  If I paid for this, I'd be LIVID.
__label__1 the lack of memory funtion really bummed me on the stock calculator. despite the smaller buttons (havent fully explored yet) i think i wil enjoy this calculator better. thanks for making it faptd
__label__0 As others have stated this does not follow pemdas, also known as order of operations. As soon as another function is called it calculates what is on the screen and then continues. So for example, of you type in 1+9x2 it will stop at 1+9, and multiply tha
__label__0 Easy to use, but doesn't really give anything new to use. My biggest frustration was that it didn't present order of operations. Even if they had included some parentheses so that we could define the order. Without that, to me, it is completely worthless
__label__1 While I agree that a calculator by itself makes a crummy free app of the day, the ability to summon dragons by flipping it upside down on its face makes this app stand out from the rest. I don't know about any of the rest of you but my stock calculator c
__label__0 Digital calculators come in two modes of operation, simple and advanced (Scientific). Simple calculators like the one you see by holding the Kindle Fire in the portrait mode do not obey the mathematical order of operation. These types of calculators expe
__label__0 Does not understand order of operation and why does it not have parentheses. The stock calculator app on my phone has parentheses and understands order of operation. I would never buy this is as it is a step down from my stock calculator. I don't care ho
__label__1 I could tell as soon as I downloaded it that I was going to love this app! The large buttons and easy-to-read display make this the perfect calculator app for my Kindle Fire! Thank you!
__label__1 Well, this app is just wonderful. I use it on my Galaxy Tab and it works perfectly. The UI is very nice, meaning it works great on my tablet. Keep up the great work.
__label__0 I dud not spend $200 to use my Kindle Fire to help me add or even perform scientific calculations.  Give us some better apps please.
__label__0 I tried this app several months ago, and it seems not much has changed.  This is missing even basic things like parentheses, not to mention many, many functions found on a scientific calculator.  And without order of operartions, you can't even do simple
__label__1 I couldn't believe the kindle fire didn't have built in calculator, this is exactly what I was looking for. great themes also, could use a little more themes...
__label__1 people who keep comparing this to their stock android calc are idiots. and mine has memory, so I'm assuming they just don't know how to use it. this was a steal at 99&cent;, but free is even better. there are none out there that combine business AND scie
__label__0 This app is a rip off of the stock Android calculator.  This app isn't even close to other paid calculators.I mean, if your device didn't come with a calculator, by all means, try this out.  But just know there are far better options out there.If your de
__label__0 DONT BUY IT SUCKS SO SO SO SO SO So BAD SO DONT BUY ITS HORRIBAL ITS A WAST OF MONEY DONT BUY
__label__1 It's a nice calculator. Works good. Just like any other calculator. I would like to point out that normal calculators do not follow order of operations either. Like they say, calculators are fast, but dumb. People are slow, but smart.
__label__1 I like this calculator. I like how you can change your settings,  change the direction and color. You don't have to worry about batteries or putting it in light.
__label__1 1+ 2 &times;3 is 9 so u guys r wrong 1 plus two is three times 3 is NINE hmmm I wonder how I got that right?
__label__0 Unfortunately this app does the math as you type and enter numbers and operations. As another reviewer pointed out, 1+2*3 is NOT 9 but this app states that it is. Pitiful.
__label__0 garbage. yeah this is really a peice of garbage. but aint nothin to it gangster rap made them develop it.
__label__1 This is a calculator and functions as such; if you expect more from it then it's definitely not the app for you.
__label__1 Not sure why there are so many negative reviews.  This calculator works great.  It calculates properly and does what you need when figuring numbers.  Works great on my kindle fire!!
__label__0 if you are performing simple math but if you need a calculator for higher level math as I do and are used to a graphing calculator or even scientific calculator that knows order of operations this calculator isn't for you. I will review again when update
__label__0 I was going to download this to try it out against RealCalc, but seeing that 1+2*3=9 here, I think I am going to pass.
__label__1 The app does what it says, nothing + nothing - . It's a calculator not a problem solving software, for those complaining about not giving the correct answer try solving the order and then CALCULATE.
__label__1 that's all I wanted.  Serves my purpose--easy to read, easy to use, and can't beat the price!!!  I feel certain that there's actually some use for those "scientific calculators" that are sold, but I have to say I don't know what it is.  Sometimes the sim
__label__1 This is an upgrade to my stock calculator which has memory and a few advanced functions. This calc offers many more functions. This app is a very nice upgrade.  People do not expect the world for free.
__label__1 I was going over the reviews and I came upon one that said that 1+2*3 is not 9, and they are completely wrong. 1+2=3, then 3&times;3=9 ( JUST SAYING). I don't have this app but the review I was talking about was just too stupid to not write about.
__label__1 it is a really awesome calculated app. i like how it can change skins and stuff. really useful, and better than other caculater apps.
__label__0 Not to beat a dead horse, but I am also shocked the order of operations is not respected.  Junk.  Going back to the built in calculator.
__label__0 I don't get why u would pay for something u can find for free n the market place. that and moat phones come stock with a similar, if not better, calculator
__label__1 This app does everything a scientific calculator is supposed to do. It is not a graphing calculator with a big display screen where you can do multiple operations, it is a scientific calculator designed to do one operation at a time. You have to know mat
__label__1 greatest calculator app ever. I tried everything else, but none came out as good. this app came through with flying colors.
__label__1 I've found this app to be good enough to replace my old sci calculator since I'm always with my Fire these days.  My only critisism is with the glass &quot;keyboard&quot; on my Fire that doesn't have a tactile feedback.  Not a fault of this app!I recomme
__label__1 Nice app! I have a SGS II and the stock calculator sucks. But this one has everything as a regular or a simple scientific calculator.And it's skinable, with 5 pre-installed skins.
__label__0 Please excuse my dear aunt Sally. The recipe called for 2/3 cup of water, 1 1/3 cup of milk, 1/4 cup of oil, 1 egg, and the cake mix. She bought 2 packages and used this app to double the recipe. She used 1/3 cup of water, 2 1/6 cup of milk (she struggle
__label__0 Why would I pay for an app that my phone already comes bundle with? Kind of useless to have this app since I can use the stock calculator and get the same result. The only thing you are really paying for is the custom skin. Not worth it.
__label__0 they need to stop doing stupid little stuff like calculators as the free app of the day its really annoying
__label__1 I was surprised that the Fire didn't come with a calculator to begin with. Given the features this calculator includes, I think the price is very fair. Hold portrait for a normal calculator, landscape for a scientific calculator. Awesome!
__label__1 Great for people with the kindle fire, but unnecessary for people using an Android phone made by HTC and possibly other manufacturer's.  This calculator does a great job and is worth its 5 stars, but this calculator functions almost identical to the free
__label__1 While it does LOOK like stock, it is far from it. Yes, you can change skins, big whoop, but if you look closer, it also does business and scientific functions. I have an HTC model phone with ICS, I also happen to need a calculator that does more than jus
__label__1 Needed a calculator and there the app was.....can't say much other than it's an easy to read (for those with glasses or eye problems lol)  and it's easy to use!!
__label__0 This app sucks.  There is no order of operations and the functions are hard to find on the fire.  I wish they had cooler free apps of the day sometimes.
__label__0 This is not a scientific calculator. A scientific calculator uses order of operations. It's acceptable to work like a 10 key calculator when it has only ten keys but when it goes into "scientific" mode it has to have order of operations.It's worse than t
__label__0 The calculator doesn't order operations in scientific mode, which is a major issue when you want a scientific calculator. Major letdown because it looks nice.
__label__1 This looks pretty handy but I couldn't find no instructions on how to use it. Something to explain what's all them buttons are for would be nice. Thanks.
__label__1 an app that is redundant. Of course, if you are a Fire user, I suppose it isn't. In which case this looks like a very good calculator app. Still, app of the day?
__label__1 Really like the transition from basic to scientific calculator - very good idea. I think I still slightly prefer RealCalc but it's a very close thing, and probably just down to the more familiar look and feel of RealCalc TBH
__label__0 Respect for algebraic order of operations is so basic and so absolutely required in a scientific calculator of this type. Since I can't even override that by using parentheses because they are not implemented either, this calculator is, unfortunately, ju
__label__0 Calculator app an eff' off award. Looks ok. Doesn't function correctly. One would think Amazon wouldn't want to be associated with such a bad app. They need independent testers to help protect amazon's image. Nothing too complicated, just a simple yes or

__label__0 You can't do much with the picture to enhance it.  I would not recommend this product, we definitely did not like it at all.
__label__0 I don't know what the problem is, but this app just won't load. Sorry, cause I would like it to work...
__label__0 I downloaded this app before I realized Amazon had warned me it may not be compatable with Kindle Fire.  Well it isn't.  Does not even show up  on my carosel.  I was warned.  Need to pay more attention to thoise compatability messages.

__label__1 its cool and funner than everyone says and I like the music too its not bad. people just overexagerate. cool.
__label__1 looks like it would be a fun way to spend some time on the phone or computer when you lazy
__label__1 This is such a cute game and its fun to pass the time with. You tilt your screen (Kindle Fire for me)  to control the little guy.  Really fun game for me!
__label__1 My kids and I love this game easy to play for the novice but gradually more challenging for the expert. The music does get a little annoying however but how many other games are too? Fun to play and well worth the price.
__label__0 This app does not need to access my phone state or information about my networks. No thanks. HTC Thunderbolt stock rooted.
__label__0 I have no idea how to play this game.  Where are the instructions?  Just a waste of my time trying to figure it out.  Have lots of games I play all the time, will not bother with this one.
__label__0 This is a very frustrating game. From the sketchy controls to the fact that if and WHEN you die it takes you all the way back to the start menu. You spend more time going through menus than actually playing the game. To top it all off even if you only li
__label__1 exactly what i wanted a nice game will look for more games like this in the future as always great apps on amazon
__label__1 This game is so much fun. That I could not stop playing it before I even realized I had already beaten the whole entire game in about half an hour.
__label__0 this is another lame attempt at gathering your Private, Personal, Confidential Information, under the guise of being a game. The permission the app asks for are INVASIVE, UNNECESSARY and WRONG!......... UNINSTALLED
__label__0 Takes forever to load on my Nexus 7.  Then one I completed the level, it wanted to post to Facebook or online.  I hate games that do that.  Uninstalled.
__label__0 there is no reason for the amount of intrusion this &quot;game&quot; has. reading my phone state has no logical reason for any game..
__label__1 Yep...another quick play game to occupy your time while waiting in a line. No real skills are involved in this game other than a steady hand.

__label__1 I got this app over a month ago and still enjoy it. Made a few reminders and decorated the calendar with a small tattoo so I had that much more to remind me. Easy to use and does what it says.

__label__1 Works well, looks good, just what was advertised.Kinda annoying that people give poor reviews based on another app doing the same job. That does not make this a 1 star app. Review the app not your frustration that it isnt a $5 game for free.
__label__1 100% customizeable! From the color to little stickers. Does what says and you can plaster you screen with countdowns. If the app is not for you...do not give pour reviews, wait until tomorrow for the next lame game!

__label__1 This us a great application. Works will and the widgets look good. Not sure I'd pay for it, but it was good while it was free.
__label__1 As a lover of countdowns, I love that I can know how many days left without having to check my actual calendar.  The little reminders on my homescreen are cute and helpful. Zero wrong with this widget. I've had nothing go wrong with this on my EVO.
__label__1 I have used the free app for a month or so and like it. The app acts as a countdown to important days and can cause you, or at least me, to get more excited waiting for big events to come.
__label__0 why why why?! why does a stupid countdown app need to know so much about me? I simply don&apos;t get get it.
__label__1 My wife is always joking that I have a count-down for something in my head as I'm always looking forward to the next big event.  Book releases.  Big movies coming out.  Holidays.  Not so much birthdays, well, not my own anyways.  And here is an app that

__label__0 This has to be the lowest of the low of any FAotD that Amazon has offered. I mean, you can get this same functionality in your built in Google Calendars. you certainly don't need a separate app or widget for that.
__label__1 This gives me a countdown reminder on my home screen.  It is just what I wanted. I love the flexibility of counting by years, months weeks or days.
__label__1 I like this widget.  It's simple.  It's easy to use.  It does what it's supposed to.  What more can you ask for.

__label__1 It has: paint to draw in, and notes look fantastic, just wish in E- mail they saw it that way we send it, but it pastes the note in, which is fine. In options which are huge, remove any record functions since we don't have a mic. Has dark and light theme

__label__1 I really can use this item.  I am a Secretary of an association and this will really come in handy for making notes and I like thedrawing pad.  Thanks for this product.
__label__1 This NotePad app allows you to not only type notes, but you can also draw little doodles (perfect for college classes where the prof. is constantly showing graphs). Easy to use
__label__1 Love this app! It is so versatile, giving me several ways to stay organized! I especially like the voice recording feature. Takes less time when you're in a hurry.  Wonderful app!
__label__1 It lets you choose a category and provides lined blanks to list things. I like to use the voice recognition instead of having to type in the words. It's pretty accurate.
__label__1 This has everything I'm looking for on my Kindle Fire so that I can easily take notes and then turn around and send them to myself.  Very nice tool to have where ever I go, right in my back pocket.
__label__1 i use this more than anything else on my kindle...almost. but i do use it for school, to take notes, for labs,  for appointments, and it has voicer recorder, paint and type. lots of pages, endless really. and i can erase and reuse. it's great, i love thi
__label__1 The pro version makes it even better with reusable check lists.  Works well. Stable and no crashing. Nice ability to export notes and lists. I recommend this as an essential app.
__label__1 For those of you that are upset about this app on your kindle fire: of course the voice recorder doesn't work! the kindle wont let it work! other than that this app is great because you can save written work and drawings on it. best free writing app out 
__label__1 I loooooooove this! it can take pretty much every kind if note, whether it's handwritten, typed, a voice memo, etc etc! Forget the other notepads, this one autosaves so you never have to worry about saving it or it timing out(: I've been using it for a w
__label__1 I don't believe the Kindle Fire doesn't come with this standard.  Call it up, push image or picture or whatever it is, and you can scrawl down a phone number or address with your finger quite easily.  I use it often when calling people from Craigslist or
__label__1 This is my husband's favorite game when he has nothing to do.  He loves playing dominoes and he lovesplaying this game too.
__label__1 I love this game with long trips or long waiting for Dr Appointments.It is better than just reading a book Thank You
__label__1 This is for me. Just something to keep occupied while waiting in line, Dr. offices, Pick up kids and just sitting and resting. I like I can put in down whenever and come right back to it.
__label__1 Just started playing Dominoes and this is one if the better versions I've played. Time flies when you play this game.Highly recommend it!
__label__0 You can select Players. Game. Color of Dominoes. Background. type of Game. and when you start the Game. the dominoes just will not move. Very frustrating.I am an experienced game player and play dominoes on my DSI all the time.
__label__1 Great app.  I really like the colored tiles.  Makes it much easier to read.  I wish the tiles didn't move everytime you add one to the board though, and would stay where you put it.
__label__1 My granddaughter thinks this is the best thing ever. Why kids and men think farting is the funniest thing I will never understand.....
__label__1 Some people may view this as crude but excuse me, we all do it and in some circumstances it is funny. I got this app so I could get my sister back for all those times that she left me standing in a shopping area with her sometimes silent and sometimes no
__label__0 Not good. It is a little funny but most of the farts do not sound realistic and they mostly sound alike.
__label__1 this game is the funniest game i have ever heard. You should really get it.  My brother and i would really like to play it.
__label__0 can take this of my saved for later apps no mater how miny times I get rid of it.and when I deleted the app it just came back later.
__label__0 really are people five fart noises DON'T  GET THIS APP cmon people .think  people  are wasting money  anyways i dont get it was so funny of fart noises omg people stupid  too
__label__1 even though I do not have this app it looks awsome but gross and weird oh forget it it looks amasing and sweet and amasing and sweet and amasing and sweet and amasing and sweet and amasing oh and did I mension it looks sweet and stuff like that crap
__label__1 it is a very challenging game. although it is the same puzzle in each level, it invites to improve the solving time. After lever 8 the challenge is high and does because there are different solutions, it is always daring.
__label__1 This game is very addicting.  My daughter loves it and even found one for her android phone.  Would definitely look at other games by the same maker.
__label__1 fun. at times I want to scream lol but other than that its really fun. very challenging. also worth it because its free!! hope u buy this
__label__1 Very nice way to keep the old brain active.  Like any games that do this, it helps stave off those nasty, old age, brain disorders.  Sadly, it still hurts to be beaten by a 12 year old.  Thanks just the same, it's still fun.
__label__0 Game would not open. Never did get to play. Kept moving on screen.  Could not get it to stop so you could play the game of untangling.  I have tried to play this game again, but it has not been fixed.  When is it going to be fixed?  Untangle is one of my
__label__1 way too easy to start with but its great when you get to the upper levels. I play way more than I thought I would
__label__0 definately glad we did not pay for this one. Never did figure it out!The lines just kept moving on the screen and you couldn't do anything with it.
__label__1 I thoroughly enjoyed the degree of difficulty and the variety of puzzles kept me interestedI look forward to playing more
__label__1 As a baker, I have a huge collection of bread recipes in hard/soft back.  It's never acase of too many for those that work in this area.  Having a totally mobile recipe stack to view and use whenever/whereever is a definate plus.  This app has that gping
__label__1 I love it. I know it looks boating but its the best thing ever! Plzzzzz get I highly recommend. I love it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
__label__1 iCooking bread is so cool I'm there biggest fan who ever made this up. me n my mom at home luv to make bread all the time. so this is the awesomest ever.keep up the good work.!!!.....:D
__label__1 I have had this book for well over a month.  The recipes are easy to read and directions are well written.  I have read through most of it and used several of the recipes.  Today I am using the pizza crust recipe.  Although the ingredients and preparatio
__label__0 This was no help to me what so ever! It was more of a pain in the buns than anything else. I did better on the classic pen and notebook paper.
__label__1 I really enjoy checking this app periodically as I count down to my wedding day. I get so excited every time!
__label__1 This app is very simple which is exactly what I wanted. It counts down to your exact wedding day and time with nice backgrounds to choose from.
__label__1 Could be better, but does what it says it does; easier for me than using a laptop to track this.
__label__1 I am Loving this app! I thought I was pretty strong in the upper body but this app has shown me how wrong I was. I'm just starting week 2, but I look forward to doing my pushups every morning now!
__label__1 Just got this app today but I think it is exactly what I needed. I also appreciate the simplicity of it in all aspects. I hate self help apps that are far too complicated to keep up with everyday. Thanks amazon!
__label__0 Almost bought this app the other day I'mglad I didnt...no walkthrough or directions of any kind. Couldnt figure it out...
__label__1 OK I love this app it works good and gives you something to push for. Something I thought of tho was why not integrate some sort of notification to give you the little push to actually do them on an every other day Basis?
__label__0 The app is very basic, yet very confusing.  No tutorial to tell you how to use it. Not really sure how to use it.  Lame program.
__label__0 app doesn't explain a damn thing.  its just a bunch of buttons. do not waste a dime in this app or any app this developer makes.
__label__1 The application does what it claims and works as claimed, which I would normally give 3 stars. However, I'm rating the app 5 STARS due to the EXCELLENT security behavior of the Developer; the app only requires Network Access rights to check license but d
__label__0 you can't combine a non intuitive interface with an app that has no instructions and have a usable application.  I can usually pick up pretty quickly how to use an app without any instructions. but this 1 is so poorly designed that I just quit trying.
__label__1 The only reason that I didnt buy this last week was because i was hopin this would be the free app of the day. My patience has paid off.
__label__1 how is that person in the picture doing a push-up when he is clearly missing his legs below the knees?  and how is the bottom half of his body floating?  magic?  i dont know.  can someone help me with this?poor guy.
__label__1 All the problems people are talking about seem to be addressed. If you don't do enough reps in a certain set you can change the number after that days workout.
__label__0 amazon appstore internet connection required = spyware.  It's the amazon drm.It's why I don't buy apps here.
__label__1 This app is great. If you're anything like me you need a lot of motivation to exercise. Hundred pushups helps you create and follow a workout schedule that fits your capabilities.Being able to track your total pushups accomplished is greatly convenient. 
__label__1 Maybe the instructions were updated before I downloaded it.Tells me what to do, shows how may sets and how many pushups per set, allows me to enter the actual number performed when I'm done. Checks my progress periodically (perform to exhaustion after tw
__label__0 I installed the app and ran through all the info they provide. When I start the app a timer starts running..... OK. Why is there a timer running?
__label__0 this is useless and eats up your memory space. tried in using it for first 2 days, didnt like it and i uninstalled it. piece of crap app
__label__0 i have no idea why theres an app just for pushups when you can get multi reps for a dollar and it does so much more. i believe this app is a ripoff.
__label__0 it is so stupid on easy no matter where you touch it goes in. makes me wonder who made this horrible game
__label__0 which is 5 $ now what am i gonna do this game doesnt even look good why would you get it anyway
__label__0 I tried shooting the ball up in the air.But it went way way way over to the side when my aiming was good.So don't waist your time and buy this app.
__label__0 This game is super hard and really stupid. There are tons of basketball games for the kindle and I wouldn't get this game.
__label__0 don't waste your time with this game, made for phone not tablets, there are better free basketball games available, try  Basketmania instead.
__label__1 This version you can customize to your liking I grew up playing euchre this game helps yo keep hour playing sharp tried some free versions this is the beet ive tried
__label__1 I play this game every day. Played it since I was 12 years old and I am 75 years old.
__label__1 I have played about 1000 hands so far on my phone, never an issue. Options for stick the dealer, going under, etc. and for the play style of your partner.  Very detailed stats.  Every once in a while I won't notice there are six cards dealt and go to pla
__label__1 This application installed and ran flawlessly on our Kindle Fire HDX 8.9.  The author is continually upgrading and improving the program. The display in very clean and uncluttered, with exceptional detail in the playing cards. There are many menu options
__label__1 Exactly what I was looking for! The design is simple and interactive enough to engage the kid. The levels are very customizable; I started my kindergartener on 0-5 addition, which mixes up any number in that range (i.e. 1+4, 3+5, 4+2) and after a month, 
__label__1 I did not waste my money buying this.it comes with a timer.you can choose different colors. its a great app. I reccomend this for kids who struggle with math.
__label__1 I got this for my grandson..oh how he loves Math.. He caught onto this game and is now at the top of his class in Math.. He is in Kindergarten...IT's truly amazing how this game helped him with math skills.. I highly recommend this game... He plays this 
__label__1 I'm a big kid and thought it would be fun to practice.  It's too easy for an adult but awesome for kids.  Cute too!
__label__1 This is a great math flash card app. Whether you want to teach your four year old basic addition or your help your nine year old with division this can help. This will give me something to keep their brains going during spring break too. Thanks for a gre
__label__1 This app has been exceptional at helping my 3rd grader learn her multiplication facts!  I highly recommend it for math memorization!
__label__1 This is something I used to use when I was little growing up. Flash cards always helped me. I was always great at math. I even taught a math class for a while. I know I'm only 19 and I taught a class and that was cool. Math has always been my favorite su
__label__1 I use this in addition to regular math flash cards with my 3rd grader.  I like that I can see the time spent, and I especially like that it also records idle time.  I show my daughter the list of missed questions, and then she concentrates on those facts
__label__1 Has really helped my youngest with math and makes it a fun thing to learn. I would recommend it highly.
__label__1 This app has been great for helping my preschooler and 3rd grader learn their math facts.It is more fun on mommy's phone!
__label__1 I got this as a free app of the day and after playing with it I would buy it again in a second if I needed too!Superb customization options, best I have seen. My ten year old does not need it but enjoyed it none the less and even my 14 year old, who thou
__label__1 I started my 5 year old on addition and subtraction before the school starts introducing the concept.  She loves doing her problems.  Even my 4 year old get into it.  I am going to use this for my children as part of their summer workbook.
__label__1 Parents!!: In options you can set up all kinds of ways to work the Flash cards: +, &times;,  -, etc, even double numbers. This is a Must Have for kids/adults needing help with math. Everyone needs refresher courses, and what a great way to go about it!. 
__label__1 I downloaded this app to brush up on my own math skills....math has never been a good subject for me and I thoughtI would take advantage of these flash cards.  I think they arefun and excellent source for increasing your math skills.....good for any age 
__label__1 I use this app to help my four year old with her addition. She loves it! The &quot;reward&quot; of balloons and colors for a perfect score works well for her.As a parent I appreciate this apps ability to be customized to fit the level of the child/area t
__label__1 A great way to get your kids to learn math. I wish I had this when my kid was going through his flash cards. Now I use this to entertain (and distract) some of my nieces and nephews. It is great and is an awesome opportunity to teach them one of the most
__label__1 I bought these to help a young girl to learn  her multiplication facts, it is fun to do and gives you feed back right away. I thought it was very good.
__label__1 I love the fact that after doing this for quite a while I found that I had worn out my brain... LOL as the numbers came i moved faster and faster until ... yes I forgot how to add 6 plus 5.... It stopped me cold... I then restarted slowly and had a lot o
__label__1 It is great .at first I was thinking it needs to be more challenging until I went to setting and changed that
__label__1 I downloaded this application for use with my 5 year old granddaughter. It's very well prepared and a joy to use. It has many options to build increasingly challenging math cards. A cute popper shows up when the child solves the problem. Very nice interf
__label__1 I clicked around on it for a bit, checking for ads, etc. and now the kids play on their own, and set the very customizable limits for their abilities, and they enjoy testing themselves with it.
__label__1 This app is worth the .99 if not more. My daughter thought it was fun to play.I liked how easy it wa s to set up and customize. I wrote a suggestion on how to look st you child's scores and the creator of the app replied back right away and has already b
__label__1 This is a great and FUN app for teaching math, no, really! A parent can even choose to customize the problem set.  You can do addition, subtraction, multiplication or division or any combination of those.  Plus, you can adjust the problems themselves.  F
__label__1 My kids fight over my Kindle to play this game and to test their scores!  They love it!  They love how it says, &#34;Great Job&#34; when they get something right.  Very good app!
__label__1 My wife is a school teacher. She loves this app but she hates writing reviews, so I'm doing this one for her.My wife says our kids need to learn their "math facts" better. I assumed any math drill app would be as good as another. Not so, according to my 
__label__1 We use this with our kindergarten child and it's been great.  You can actually choose your own set of numbers to fit the age level you're working with.  He enjoys seeing the stars pop up and the "awesome" when he gets it right and it encourages him to tr
__label__1 This app is fun, colorful, highly customizable, and full of info about how your child is doing.My daughter almost enjoys learning with these. (I say almost because the nature of flash cards is repetitive and so I have to enforce use.) It's much more fun 
__label__1 My 7-year old is struggling this year with the basics in math--very resistant to plain flashcards and rote memorization.  I love that I can set timers, customize problem sets and there is the interactive &#34;cheering&#34; to spur her on.  This does addi
__label__1 I so recomend this for parents with little kids. It will be a great way to train them tor elementry school. They can learn their math facts before anyone else in the class. And then, you'll just be one awesome super- parent!
__label__1 I really like this I do it once a day. I can get easy problems or hard ones. It is fun!
__label__1 I love these! My 7 yr old enjoys them too. He likes that you can change the color and sounds. I like that you have control of the numbers and math facts. It also keeps track of how your child scores.  I like the options. It takes a little bit to figure o
__label__1 I love that this app is so flexible.  My DD is learning the times tables so we can adjust it for just the table she's learning that week.  We've got a rule that before she plays any other games she has to do at least 2 sets of flash cards.  No complaints
__label__1 My nephew struggles with this memorization so I thought I would get them for him on an electronic device for him to work on.  It has worked so far.
__label__1 This is a fun way for children to learn math.  It can be set up to show a range within the childs grade level for addition, subtraction, and multiplication tables.  You can also mix addition and subtraction in the same flash card set up.  Great for all a
__label__1 I think this app is great. It is very user-friendly, easy to understand and operate, and a lot of fun while educational. My daughter who is almost 9 loves it and it has helped her learn and practice her multiplication facts. I love the fact that you can 
__label__1 This tool helps my 8 year old and my 4 year old either reinforce or learn math skills.  The older one helps my youngest how to do math and keeping him at a fast pace.
__label__1 This is an excellent quick way to get my boys practicing their math facts.  You can adjust the set range of facts from 1-12, through addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.  It was well worth the 99 cents.
__label__1 My daughter loves this game and it has been a great tool to help her learn her multiplication tables this year.  We love it!
__label__1 I absolutely love this math app.  I purchased it for my daughter back in 2012 (she'll be 7 this summer.)  She really enjoys doing the math problems and, thanks in part to this app, was already quite proficient at addition and subtraction before she even 
__label__1 My second grader who HATES doing flashcards has really enjoyed this app.  It makes our life easier Thank you very much!
__label__1 I wish this stuff existed when I was a kid.  It is so much better than paper flash cards, yet in essence that is all that this is.  I don't know why sticking flash cards into an App makes them so much more fun, but it does.  Our kids love this App, and w
__label__1 I am very glad that I bought this as it is great for for homeschooling and it has a lot of settings to customize the difficulty from about 1st grade to 8th grade from what I can tell. You can have vertical or horizontal problems as well. The only thing t
__label__1 This one is very helpful in that it allows you to customize it to their level.  This keeps me from having to go get more flash cards evertime he advances, or having to go find where we put those cards the last time he was going through them.  I'd been ma
__label__1 These flash cards are great review for my 3rd grader.  Especially handy when have to wait in the doctor's office.  He has fun and is learning at the same time!  Also a great introduction to math for my preschooler.
__label__1 Enjoy playing the game.  It is a good way to learn the strategy of the game.Both my Husband and I enjoy the game.
__label__1 This is a great way to break up the day or to grab when you only have a few minutes. I play it daily
__label__0 Long time euchre player. Game is way too fast. Last hand opponents always have an ace for the last trick when trump cards are used up.  What is play under mean?  Not the real game of euchre. If u get 3 tricks, sometimes u do not get a point. Are there an
__label__1 Even better that it's free. I love euchre even if I do have to play against the computer :). I can play anytime anywhere & I can stop anytime & pick up right where I left off. Good game. No frills just plain cards & plain euchre.
__label__1 I have always loved euchre and this is a great game with no ads.  I like that I can change the player names and also the challenge of play.
__label__1 This is by far the best euchre program I have ever used. The opponents are good players, and don't cheat.I spend WAY too much time playing.
__label__1 fun game - play it all the time - just what I wanted to get - enjoy it lots -
__label__1 This app is perfect if you love to play euchre fast and with the computer as opponents. I love that you can change the names and settings easily. Great app! I have played daily for months.
__label__0 There were no instructions whatsoever on how to play this game.  I had no idea what do or what the scoring meant.
__label__1 I love playing this game.  I played it for many years and had a great time.  I played in tournaments and it was a fast paced and fun game.  The fact that you have a partner is fantastic because it helps with making you points.  This game is wonderful for
__label__1 I absolutely love the game of Euchre since way, way back in the last century. I have played hundreds of games. I thought possibly with this app and three computer hands to play against I might gain enough knowledge to actually win my first ever game! But
__label__1 Euchre is one of my favorite games and when I found it on here and it was FREE I was so happy! It is a very fun game to play and I enjoy playing it!
__label__0 opponats always have the right card to play. Your partner never has it. its never buried. it just gets old after a while. Look for another game there has to be a better one.
__label__1 I love the game ofeuchre played it for years.It keeps your mind thinking. I paly it everyday. Thank you
__label__1 I really enjoy playing Euchre with this app because of its' flexibility in play.  I've only played a few games so far but I have enjoyed the challenges it provides.
__label__1 Euchre is my favorite Card game.  So glad I found this app. for my Kindle Fire.  You made me very happy.
__label__1 Besides loving the game of Euchre anyway, this game app is easy to play. No delays, very responsive!  Just wish the cards were just a bit bigger though.  Have trouble at times seeing what some cards are.
__label__1 Not usually a card player but I do love euchre. This is realistic except the other team always seems to hold the missing 'trump' card!
__label__1 I have tried several of the Euchre games, this one to me is the best.  It shows everything just like you are playing for real. Other games it was hard to keep up with who was playing but this one is great
__label__0 I love Euchre its a game i play all the time weather it be with friends and family or on my pc. I downloaded this app on my kindle hoping for it to be fun to play while i had down time or while on the go. Not very good if you are looking for a Euchre app
__label__1 The computer AI makes it really hard to win especially when my partner is table talking with our opponents.  Although I still win. A lot... but this is only because I am an AAAAaaaaammmazinng Euchre player.
__label__0 Nothing seems to make sense, you can't pick it up, you can't order your partner up and I didn't find any instructions anywhere.  Maybe it's because I'm new to the kindle world and having difficulty b/c of that, but I deleted the app.
__label__1 I love euchre, but I have no one to play with.  The computer is my partner.  It is quite challenging.  I like this version better than others  have checked out.
__label__1 Great game. I used to play this all the time. Now I can play it anytime without having to hunt for someone to play.
__label__0 if they would bother to list where this is available it would save alot of people alot of time....common courtesy STILL goes a long way.
__label__1 I love it because I am handicapped and I can order from Peapod anywhere by taking my Kindle with me.
__label__1 I do most if not all of my peapod orders on my Kindle 1st generation now, with this app.  Only thing you can't do is access and/or change some account information.  But it's handy to be able to do the order wherever you are when you're ready to do it (li
__label__1 I used the Peapod website on my laptop with great results. I could not figure out how they could translate it to a smaller screen and make it as easy to use, but they did. Very easy to use. The app and the service are just remarkable. It is winter and I 
__label__1 Very good app to have. I may not always be 100% happy with PeaPod, but when I do order I love using the app. Very easy and convenient.
__label__1 Hate these montrous grocery stores, Peapod makes shopping easy. I keep a running grocery list on the site, as a run out of things.
__label__1 Been using Peapod since it started in the Chicago area I love it. Very easy to use app and I am happy I can see it on my kindle screen and not use the iPhone.
__label__1 Very satisfied with this easy to use and feature packed App. If you use Peapod you need this App. It's that simple. And, if you don't use Peapod, you should. Why waste time at the store when you can have your groceries delivered right to your kitchen tab
__label__1 Since I use PEAPOD HAVING THIS APP ON MY KINDLE IS VERY HELPFUL ~ On the Kindle you can view the products very clearly & actually place an order, just GREAT !
__label__1 We shop for more than 95% of our groceries through Peapod, an outstanding service particularly for those unable to get to a store on a regular basis due to age or infirmaries.  I was thrilled there was an app available. After logging in I found all my li
__label__0 this may be good for those people who have it in there area, however in my area, it is not available at this time. sure sounded great though.
__label__1 I do this for my 92 year old Mom .. this app makes it easy for what is already a fantastic program!
__label__1 i like this app easy to jump on if you have something to add to your order before getting shipped out.  definitely recommend !!
__label__0 don't bother.. this game sucks on multiple levels. Ghraphics sonund and options are all lame, looks nothing like the Milton Bradley classic.
__label__1 Easy to play. Lots of similar qualitiies. Brought back some great memories. An easy enjoyable break from reading. Highly recommend it.
__label__0 i couldn't figure out what to do, the graphics suck and you cant even play with another human. DON'T BUY THIS APP
__label__0 This app is very hard to use. I have not played battleship (the real game) on a long time and don't really remember how to play. The game gives no rules! I won but don't know how. Also, the grid has no letters or numbers on it. I am uninstalling this app
__label__1 Fun, runs well on my Android tablet. I was skeptical at first but after playing I certainly liked it. Delightful!
__label__0 did not like this at all. poor graphics.  difficult to log in. &ntilde;ot fun at all. don't download this app.  not even worth being free. lol.
__label__0 I got it thinking this would be a nice little game to play to pass the time. NOT TRUE.  Nikola if your still updating this game and didn't just quit on it then in the next update include instructions!!!!!!!! I opened the app looking for instructions and 
__label__1 Very addictive app. Suitable for all ages. Works great with first generation Kindle Fire. Love the option of playing with dots or flowers/fruit. Also like being able to change the backdrop. Highly recommended!
__label__1 I really love this game. It is very addicting. I even got my husband to download it  and he plays it too.
__label__0 Read through the cookie cutter, repeated and simply bogus 5 Star reviews. Deceptive practice you would expect from a game that has no exit option and stays running in the background.
__label__1 KEEPS MY INTEREST BY CHALLENGING MY MIND EACH TIME I PLAY THIS GAME.  I ENJOY PLAYING.  IT HOLDS MY INTEREST AND I FIND MYSELF PLAYING BEECELLS DAILY. GREAT FUN
__label__1 Bee Cells is a game that keeps the mind working.  Need some skill to complete this game.  This game is for the older game players.
__label__1 This is a mindless little game which gets you thinking about things other than our everyday stresses.I I I I
__label__0 Simply put this is a boring game. You can get similar games for free if you look.  Adding tracking software to a paid ap is a nono as far as I am concerned. Possible fake reviews are worse.  You guys get one star for this action.
__label__0 I suppose I could try to figure out what the point of the game is, but I really don't care. This FAOTD was a dud, as far as I'm concerned.
__label__0 This may be a great game but I did not figure out how to play it. It has Great graphics though.
__label__1 If you read (Product info) above, it exsplains everything!. There is nothing wrong with moving a color, it's the users. Simply tap once on the color to activate, then tap on the board where you want it to go. It will zig and zag around other colores to g
__label__0 No in-game instructions, unnecessary permissions, crap graphics, and data snooping. Broken. Leaves me wondering how much amazon got paid to make this the FAOD. :-(
__label__1 Can't seem to stop playing. No rules or notes on how to play but once you start it is fairly easy and then it gets harder as you go. Good no brainer at first but then gets you to think stradigey
__label__0 This app stays running in the background and has no option to exit the game properly. This is a shady practice. The game lacks a polished feel to it.
__label__0 the 4-5 star reviews sound like someone from Bootant arguing with this other reviews, telling you how easy it is and how fun it was to figure out how to play. Uh in what world is figuring out how to play fun? it's frustrating and sucky.
__label__0 This game is just a waste of time. It is boring and there is not possibility to play the game and win. You get to move one ball and when you get a group of 6 they disappear. Unfortunately the game adds multiple balls for every one you move so ultimately 
__label__0 After purchasing and enjoying the game one time I shut down my kindle and when I went to play it again it said I needed to put in a password.  I do not have a password so I was not able to play again.
__label__1 My newest favorite! Takes more thought than I had expected,  making it  a good challenging game. The rules are very simple & easy to play. But getting your score higher, is the fun part. I love it!!!
__label__1 I like this game a lot.  You have to strategically fill in the cells.  It's a great challenge! I recommend it if you want to put your thinking cap on.
__label__1 If you do not want a additive game then you had better move on! I like the color blind choice also. At times I get so frustrated and think wow I wish there was a undo of course that would make it too easy, try it and have fun.
__label__1 makes me think, makes me plan moves and I enjoy playing this game.I find the challenges it offers great. Not sure I will ever win but its fun trying
__label__1 Difficult to put down at times.  It helps with hand-eye coordination and exercising flabby gray matter:)  Try not to start a game if you are pressed for time!
__label__0 I guess I didn't care for this game and deleted it.  I don't even remember getting it.  Maybe I should try it again.
__label__1 Addictive,bee careful! I prefer the flowers and fruit and like that you get a choice. Time can fly by once you've started
__label__1 I love this game.  It is always a challenge, and I find myself playing it every day trying to beat my old score.  I could never get tired of playing it.
__label__1 Bad thing is on fire you have to press home key to exit. On my first game I got 110 points. The game doesn't take up much memory. It does everything the designer indicates.  I don't get every free app of the day.  Of the several hundred I did get some ar
__label__0 This game has a lot of stuff you don't want, and is missing some stuff you do want.Once you start this game there is no way to stop it unless you kill it with a task manager or restart the device.  POOR programming practice!  This means it also ignores t
__label__0 I agree with most others on here. No exit button among other issues drives this rating way down. This game has to go.
__label__0 It's very diffcult to play.  I am always looking for something that is quick and fun and this just wasn't the game for me.
__label__0 Not only is the game so poorly designed that it is impossible to actually win, but it also contains a new form of adware/privacy destroying add-on-ware called &quot;Swarm&quot; that, if you go to their website and look, is actually proud that they are th
__label__1 Ugh, this is too simple and too repetitive to be SO addicting... I actually HATE this game, it's the same, there's NO winning, no chance, EVER... so... I just play and play again. As soon as I lose, I start an new game.  Grrr... 5 stars for most used app
__label__1 I love this game. It is simple enough to learn but challenging enough to keep me entertained for a length of time. You have to connect 6 of a color in any way as long as they all connect. Every game is of course different since the computer randomizes th
__label__0 Game does not maximize to full screen on Motorola Xoom, which make everything too small to tap and too small to read.  Game defaults to Asian language, instead of the English language.  I will reinstall if the screen issues are fixed.
__label__0 Game will notl load properly. I only got a out an eighth of the game to load. Not worth it.TWill check again later to see if it gets better.
__label__0 I found it very difficult to operate the controls. Sometimes it worked and sometimes it didn't. Needs to be refined.
__label__0 Everything about the game is awkward, amateurish, and NOT player-friendly.  Crappy graphics, obnoxious music,  and really bad game-play.  There are so many great games available, it's a shame to waste time on one this bad.  Played on Kindle Fire 2nd gen.
__label__1 If you are interested in adult beverages and want to learn more about mixed drinks this is a great app. I've tried many drinks from it some were a great success and some not so much, but that is the fun of mixology.
__label__1 This is a fun app to have.  It has a huge list of different drinks.  Some of the features I really like are: save favorite drinks; have the app pick a random drink; if connected to the internet, you can find the closest liquor store.  The search features
__label__1 I don't mix drinks anymore, but that didn't keep me from getting this app.  More than once,  the conversation has come up "what does such and such a drink have in it"....  Well, this is your app..  Also, it's database is HUGE, so I'm sure it has more tha
__label__0 this app is OK its not that good actually and I wish I could give it zero stars it is really boring if your looking for a good app like this play speedx 3d. that game is awesome
__label__1 It is a really fun and adicting game. I found this game on youtube;I didn't know it had an app. I haven't had any problems with it.
__label__1 fun game i got to level four on first try. :-) (-:  hdgxxhhgdd hdbdf hxhddh hxhdg hdbddhd bgdhdd hxhdhd hdhdhdd hdb dhhh ddhd
__label__1 This game is amazing! Fast download and challenging! You will NEVER get bored with this! It's free too!  Get Now!
__label__1 ok,  I love love love love love LOVE this game!!!!!!!!!!!! but I have to say something EXTREMLY important..............I LOVE ICECREAM!!!!!!!! sorry, did I say important? I should have said unimportant
__label__1 This app is just like the version I play on my computer but now I can take it anywhere I want. now only if they made happy wheels for kindle fire...
__label__1 this game is so addictive I picked it up and couldn't stop!  I played forever trying to beat my highscore.I finally did going to level nine with a high score of 356 this game is non-stop fun there are no bumps and glitches and distracting adds which make
__label__0 its not even the real cube runner.the graphics are terrible and it runs very slowly.I suggest not getting it.trust me.
__label__1 Very fun.  Awesome on kindle fire!  This game is addicting and passes time.  You can use it at any age because you just steer to avoid the cubes.  =&gt;
__label__0 I love this game on the kindle fire but on the kindle fire HD it tilts the wrong way! I am not happy with this app. If you have a kindle fire HD don't get it! It will just make you angry.
__label__0 I personally love cube field on the computer, so I bought this game with high expectations. But it is a big disappointment to me. You have to tilt the device really far to get the ship to turn. Even in the hardest setting it isn't very fast, and the lack
__label__0 Maybe good for beginners but as a program user of several years, I found this app to be very limiting in information and recipes.
__label__0 This app is not worth your time or money. It did not load on my Kindle Fire and it does not work. Stay away from this app. I am now deleting it from my apps permanently!!! Run away fast!!!!!
__label__0 This web site was not user friendly for me and there are way to many steps to enter your meals for the day.It is not android  yet only Iphone. I wanted something for my phone as well as internet
__label__0 was not helpful. you can just look up the info on any website. not worth the download. i'm sure there are better apps for weight loss
__label__1 Just getting started in reviewing this approach
__label__1 This is an easy and great little app for keeping track of those times when your kid's misbehave or behave well for implementation of punishments/rewards.  I am starting a points reward system with my boys and want to easily be able to track their behavio
__label__1 I love that this app of a stop light helps me be able to utilize this wonderful technique for behavior management!  My son's class uses this at school.  I love that we can have a consistent across the board tool to use!
__label__0 When I tried to put the second child on red it wouldn't let me. 0 stars if I could &gt;:(
__label__1 I can finally keep track of my daughter Olivia . after she found out about my app she never whined or kicked or did any of that stuff.
__label__0 I tried it about a million times and it did not workit worked the first time but I could not get into the behavior status
__label__0 This was not what i expected. I had been looking for an app to use in my classroom but quickly realized this was not the app for me
__label__0 Downloaded to my Kindle Fire, considered a high end device, large screen, no screen protector to interfere. But it is almost impossible to click the green light. Can you imagine a child's outrage at seeing 7 yellows they didn't deserve, entered while try
__label__0 Disappointed with lack of directions or if I missed them - I would say it is not user friendly.Not at all what I was hoping for.
__label__1 This app turns my Kindle into a writing tool that I can use anywhere I go. I especially like the way it can sync to other devices.
__label__1 I like this app works great on my kindle fire.  I like the dictionary and Theseus option as well and you can adjust font really nice works for my purpose
__label__1 There are tons of writing apps, but all of them you can only write blank amount of things. This app you can write as much as you want. I love it&iexcl;&iexcl;&iexcl;!!!
__label__1 This app is PERFECT for those who want to write stories, poems, essays, and more, whether professionally or as a hobby.It saves to a Google account. Put your account info in and go to My Writing Spot. com if you want to access you stories/writing pieces 
__label__1 This is a great way to be able to write where ever you are. For  writing down that idea you just had that you don't want to forget, to writing a few pages. It's password protected so prying eyes can't read it before your ready to share. This would be goo
__label__1 my dad got this kindle fire for me for my Christmas present this and Sims 3 pets for my xbox 360 so I have to wait to get this app but it looks awesome.
__label__1 Don't expect lots of formatting options. However its very easy to get to your writing from an app or the web. Perfect for writers who hop devices all the time. Use a computer when you have one and a phone or tablet when you don't.If you have files in the
__label__1 I use this app for any notes I get or any stories I write. It has been a very good help to me. A MUST Buy.
__label__1 As a professional writer, i look for writing apps suitable for all the things required for a good story. This app seemed like heaven to those authors out there. You have dictionary, thesaurus, password to open the app, and in your selection you can chang
__label__1 Great and simple. This app allows you to write whatever you want. If it's poems, books, essays, diary, stories, or for taking notes then you've got it. You can name and color code your different documents. It also allows you to access a password lock to 
__label__1 This is really great because you can type as much as you want and save as many things as you want! I love this app, and it is well worth the money.
__label__1 Love the ability to write everywhere I go.  I also love that I can sync it with my laptop and other devices.
__label__0 I am supposed to write whatever, personal stuff perhaps or a story I may be working on and sync it to.some unnamed server with a company who does not post any assurance that my data is private? That's the thing about the "cloud" there is no guarantee tha
__label__1 I love this app! Recently, I've had this strange habit of writing books and this app is awesome. In my science class, I tend to pull out my kindle and act like I'm taking notes when I'm actually writing my latest novel! This app is wonderful! (:
__label__1 I love this game. It well worth the price. Great controls. The reaction to the movement is perfect.  Making pong better than ever before.
__label__1 GREAT EYE, HAND COORDINATION GAME.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND. REALLY KEEPS YOUR INTEREST IN GETTING TO HIGHER LEVELS.  I WOULD RECOMMEND TO ANYONE.
__label__1 This game of breakout offers many twists and changes that makes the original game great.  Really enjoyed playing this game.  Highly recommend the game to players that would like a simple, fun game.
__label__1 Runs great on my phone, graphic are fun (doodle-esque), not sure about sound because I play all my games with the sound off.Best of all: NO PERMISSIONS and NO IAP!Overall, great implementation of a simple concept, high replay value.
__label__1 This game played just like you would expect this old classic to play like.  I have no complaints. Droid Incredible 2.
__label__1 Great twist on a classic game. Fun to play with good replay value. As another reviewer commented, I often lost the ball while chasing other things on the screen. Smooth game play on my tablet. If you like retro games, this one is well worth the download.
__label__1 Simple moving platform and ball game, there are plenty like it so just find the one that you yourself enjoy playing the most and stick with that.CJB
__label__1 When I first got my nexus 7 a few months ago, this is one game I was looking for. A nice simple breakout game with no unnecessary permissions. I have tried a couple others and gave them the boot for different reasons, but I will keep and play this one.
__label__1 No permission issues, no problems running or controlling. Might be the first 5 star I've given an app. Nice redo of a classic.
__label__1 On a quad this is quite well made. Great free app and well worth .99.A couple of suggestions. 1) Make a little more difficult or add easy, difficult. Was on level 24 with 10 free games left. (Restore is an excellent feature to compensate for that)2) chan
__label__1 I always loved blocks. I'm glad I downloaded it while it's free. haven't played it yet but I know it will be good.
__label__1 Nice colorful graphics with no glitches. A bit too easy, would have loved more challenges. Thank you Bootant for not requiring any permissions! I recommend this game for any kindle user.
__label__1 Arakanoid game any day is awesome. From the original to any one keeps me busy. I like the different back grounds.
__label__1 Fun simple app that is addicting and just a simple concept . Vivid colors and changing levels keep it fun
__label__1 It's my favorite game!  It reminds me, vagely, of the old pong game we played on the tv back in the 70's.  I love trying to beat my previous score.
__label__1 Its great fun . My grandkids can play this game. Its just loads of fun, very enjoyable and hard to put down.
__label__1 This game is very similar to the old Atari Pong.  Excellent graphics and very easy to play although it gets harder as you progress.  This is one of those games that I keep going back to after getting bored with other games.
__label__1 Nice game to play. I thought it would be another dull game, but it turned out to  be very enjoyable.
__label__1 Paddle control is perfect, colores are bright and some times rather 3D. Could use more special effects since this is the future, but still feel others will say it's a Must for there collection. All in all, a very solid game. Remember: It's EZ, when you S
__label__1 This game was a lot of fun and I play it often. Once you get started you do not want to quit until you complete all the levels. One draw back is if you do not pass the level you will go back to level 1. Great game for all ages.
__label__1 who doesnt like games like this, a lot of fun to play when you have down time and you are bored
__label__1 This is about as good of a Arkanoid knock off as you will ever find.  I miss playing the original at the laundromat next to my first job as a teenager.  this does a fine job of recreating on my phone.
__label__1 Really more like Arkanoid in many ways, although I haven't found lasers yet.  Smooth, fluid, nice control system, pretty to look at...an instant classic!  Thanks so much for offering it!
__label__1 I use to play the much older version on the computer. I saw this game and it is just like I remember but has much better graphics.
__label__1 All of the other blocks games that I have tried on my Kindle were unresponsive to touch, but this game is great.
__label__1 Wow, this game brings back a lot of memories. I have played many a breakaway clones and playing this reminded me how much I loved them. This proved to be exciting to play and well worth picking up, especially for just a dollar. Word of advise, put your f
__label__1 Neat game with different levels. Love it that the ball changes color with each different color block it hits. Runs great on the DROID 2:
__label__1 Simple and addicting. No permissions!This is how apps *should* be written, no invasive permissions.Decent coding. Great way to pass time. I got it on FAOTD.It's a keeper.
__label__1 Game play:This is a classic bounce the ball off of the colored blocks at the top of the screen and continue until you have missed the ball and used all of the balls you have available to you. The blocks are aligned in various formations so the game is ch
__label__1 As a huge fan of the original game, a person who has tried all the apps so far - free and purchased, I can honestly say I most enjoy this version. For starters, this game can not be duplicated in exact form when your finger is controlling the bar. This b
__label__1 fun to play but don't play this if you think it will be relaxing. I am on the edge of my seat when playing this. you have to move quickly.
__label__1 Finally ...... aways loved the game Breakout but all the bock type games were crummy ..... Not this one, great game!!!!!
__label__1 I loved breakaway and this is a visually stunning update to the old classic.The vibrant blocks are arranged in different patterns for each level.  The background patterns are varied and keep the game interesting.  The falling bonuses are fun!  Watch out 
__label__1 I got so addicted to this game i would play it for hours i played it so much i beat the game within two weeks and i still play it
__label__1 I enjoy this game.  It took quite awhile before it got too difficult for my slow reflexes - that's a good thing for an older gal.I really liked it!
__label__0 I loved the old blocks game but the controls on the screen just do not work as good as the video game console.  too hard to keep up with the ball
__label__1 Very fun version of Breakout.  I like the addition of game-altering actions hidden within the blocks.  Just one suggestion and one &quot;bug&quot;. The suggestion would be to continue on the board the player ended with rather than having to restart the e
__label__1 love this game. works great on the Kindle Fire and very addictive! No lags or problems. reminds of a game I use to play as a kid on the old Ataria.
__label__1 I picked up this app as the free app of the day because I enjoyed the classic arcade game.  This game works great on my Kindle Fire and is easy to play.  Moving the paddle on the bottom of the screen is smooth...not jerky as I have encountered with other
__label__1 This is the very first arcade game I played (Atari) and have been hookedon it since. It really helps me keep my reflexes up to par (can be nerve rackingtoo) at times.  :-)
__label__1 Loved the app. works great on the kindle since its bigger than the phone. Only thing is if you lose, you start alllll the way at the beginning level.
__label__1 Classic and free! What a bargain. Its on sale right now but it wont be forever! You absolutely must get it. Fantastic color block game that brings us back in time to the classics.
__label__1 With all of the other hundred games based on this premise, it would be easy to overlook this one as just another clone. However, this game excels at what the others lack. Interestingly enough, the blocks are actually 3D (though you still play in a 2D pla
__label__1 Finally! !!!! A great block breaker game! The control of the paddle is good. Works perfect on kindle fire. It only takes one level and you get challenges thrown at you.Love this game!!!!!!! It was free today but I would have paid good money for this game
__label__1 i really love this game. when i happen to get some down time i like to play it.easy to get started and can stop anytime.
__label__1 This is a great, easy to play version of the classic blocks game I grew up with.  Fun, easy to operate and a great way to pass a little time.  Lots of power ups make things interesting.
__label__1 This is a fun game and a bit challenging at times.  One I find myself going back to when I need some entertainment.
__label__1 Reminds me of the old Atari system.  That kinda tells my age. Haven't played much but it is fun.  Works well on kindle fire.
__label__1 This game is very similar to the classic game of "Pong," or a pinball machine. It's a lot like Pong on Steroids!  But the game has been updated, and a lot of extras have been added.  Here are some things I like:1. The action is fast.2. There are a lot of
__label__0 I have already deleted this app, not what I thought it would be. not worth your time downloading it to play.
__label__1 This game is smooth on Kindle Fire, Nexus 4 and Sensation 4G. Very responsive, very fun and doesn't want access to all ypur information!!!
__label__1 I originally had this on my iPod Touch and was hoping to find something similar for my Fire, only to discover that the exact one was in the app store! It's the same game I know and love. I can play this game for hours without getting bored. Simple yet ad
__label__0 I couldn't tell you bad nor good. It never worked for me. I got rid of it and never tried it again.
__label__1 I haven't been able to quit playing since I got the game. It is addicting and I love playing. I would recommend it to friends and family.
__label__1 I got this app when it was a freebie for the day, which is a good thing, because I might've missed out on it if I hadn't! Block breaking games aren't really something I seek out, but this one has totally won me over. It's a great app, with wonderful grap
__label__1 A good game to pass the time. Lots of challenging levels.  Good for finger and eye coordination. Works well for the Motorola Xoom tablet.
__label__1 i haven't tried it on my fire yet, but on the cell phone it's nicely proportioned so that it's easier to pong back to the blocks.  one thing that stood out to me as different from other blocks games was that on the very first fire of the ball it just fir
__label__1 I think it is a little bit like block buster.It has the same rules and everything.I think that block buster got a 5 star rating from me also.
__label__1 It's hard, and yet fun. If you like to challenge yourself this is the game for you. Speed increases with levels and each level is different. Love this game.
__label__1 I have always loved Breakout style games, and this is one of them. The graphics are decent, there are no permissions, and the controls work, so what is to keep you from downloading a classic?
__label__0 I actually put this app on for my son to play with but have used it also.  It just didi not keep your interest for long.
__label__1 Yep, we're all loving this silly, simple, &#34;Pong-style&#34; game. Try it! Why is there a minimum number of words required for reviews???
__label__0 At first, I liked this game, the multi-ball happened, there were balls flying everywhere! It brought back memories of when I was a kid and I had to clean the men's bath house in San Francisco, there were balls all over the place there too!The reason I am
__label__1 this is a super super cool game! will keep u or ur little siblings entertained for hours on end promise!
__label__1 Works great on my kindle fire! No problems with the game lagging. It's a great way to pass time. Although the game is repetitive, there's plenty of achievements to play for.I do agree with some other reviewers about the pearls. it would be great if you c
__label__1 I realy loved the game. i would play it all the time but after a wile i decided I liked it so much to give it my email so i could do more with the game but then it took forever to lode. i waited a hour and it still was loading the app. I just delited it 
__label__1 All of you saying you can't download it, is it really that hard to turn on your WiFi? I tried downloading it through the 3G network, it told me to download it through WiFi, so I simply did as I was told and it downloaded in seconds. This is probably the 
__label__1 this game is sooooo fun! can you believe you can catch a sea banana? but i agree with the other people you cant really do anything after you buy the bamboo rod and upgrade your tank. the rest deals with pearls and they are really hard to earn unless you 
__label__0 The only place I can do is catch fish and look at my tank that's it I do not recommend it
__label__1 I love this game its fun and cute and good for kids all you need to cast the rod and wait for a bite then catch the fish and sell them if you have 2 of them sell them. and make money.
__label__1 OMG! LOL! I got the game and used my pearls to get new fishes. Then I got toooo much addicted to it and had to uninstall it. I recomend this game
__label__1 This app is Very fun and A time waster if your bored! Also Very addicting! Add me! Name is : LexiTheVampire
__label__1 you should get this game.  to me its the best game on the amazon shop.  p.s. don't spend any pearls you get unless you've thought about.
__label__1 This is a simple fishing game where you catch rare and uncommon fish and add them to you aquarium. I love this game because its adorable and fun! The fish are so pretty! &hearts;
__label__1 I really like this game. my only real complaint is that its hard to earn money and pearls. other then that I think this game is great. the sea animals are cute and there are over 500 you can catch including comical imaginary fish and merfolk. I recommend
__label__1 I love this app but on my phone Sony Erricson Play it took up alot of space but on my kindle however it was amazing but a month after it took a long time to load and do people even read these things?
__label__1 Really addicting.All you have to do is click at the right time to catch the fish.Then you put them in your tank and buy food to feed them.Mt 3 yr old cousion loves to feed and watch the fish.
__label__1 this is a very easy to pick up and play game. fishing and aquarium. cant really believe its free as its very fun. lots of fish. plenty of options, and goals. easy for kids and fun. thanks a lot
__label__1 I love how you can use different bait and fishing poles to catch different fish. I always love catching the rare fish and putting them in my tank and selling the fish I already have for money. This is a fun game I highly reccomend it!
__label__1 My 5 year old can't stop playing this. There is so much variety that it is not going to get old any time soon. I'm surprised this is a free app!
__label__1 Love this one ..... it's great if you just want some mindless fun. Plus, there seems to be no end to it. Some apps are solved in a day or two. I'm always looking to see what new creature I'm going to catch! The only drawback, I guess, is that it entices 
__label__1 I like this game cud it is creative and fun kids will love it just like me also try birdland
__label__0 Sounds like a good game, but the download stopped and I got a message saying that the game was &quot;too large to download&quot; and that I needed a wi-fi connection. Huh?  What's the point of a phone game if you can't download it without wi-fi? Does it 
__label__1 this is a fun exciting game that is adorable and very amusing it made me happy and keeps me up just to colect pearls
__label__1 The fish are humorous and varied enough to keep the game interesting.  The lack of violence means my kids can play it too.
__label__0 it was sooooo boring!!!! taking care of my real live fish is more interesting than this game!!! don't get it! you'll regret it!!!
__label__1 my boy friend recimended it its cute interesting and addicting. I like it like I like my boy friend!!!!!!!! so ya
__label__0 It was OK but I was expecting more...  Its hard to earn money and it won't let me use the fish tank for the backround-live-video-feed thing.
__label__1 Its so simple but so addicting! This game could entertain me for a lifetime because of the thousands of possible fish you can collect. In the words of Pokemon... I gotta catchem all!
__label__1 this is a very cute game and i am enjoying it. i have been playing for 2 days and i already have caught 3 rare fish, anywhere from 5 to 50 anyone will enjoy these little fishies.
__label__1 Don't listen to other ppl. if u r asking my opinion I luv it!!!!!  Awesome game!!!!!! But other ppl r just interested in violent games and stupid stuff so they might not enjoy this as much as I do. If u like action or violence this is not the game for u.
__label__1 Once you start playing this game.... you become addicted tto everything this game has to offer. nobody can change my opinion about what i think about this game.
__label__1 this game is soo fun!!!I could play it for hours Apon hours!!! I love all the different fish and its a great time waster!!! I would suggest this game to anyone!!!
__label__0 i cant  one star minimum. k i hate this cuz fishing is impossible! i mean really. other then thet one ginormis flaw its jrs as great as a fishtank game can b without any fish!
__label__1 GET THIS APP. I love the music the most. It fits so well! The fish are so unique and I love how the fish you catch vary with the rods and bait you use. Plus the app is free so none is lost if you don't like it. This is great if you love pet games.
__label__1 this is one of the kids favorite games. simple enough for even the youngest, they play it whenever they can.
__label__1 I love this game its so amazing you should get it and my 3 words are BEST GAME EV3R and epicly awesomely amazing
__label__1 My granddaughter loves this game and so do I. I likenit because it teaches her responsibility and she loves it.
__label__1 works great on the t-mobile g2. i love how cute it is! it's not frustrating like angry birds! the one bad thing i will say is that it's highly addictive!! but i love it!
__label__1 Great app for all ages. You select/buy different rods to catch different kinds of fun fish. For example,  the candy cane rod catches fish relating to the Christmas holiday ie: red elf hat fish, x-mas tree fish, etc. You feed the fish and they give u coin
__label__1 This is my stress relief. There is a rhythym to this that you can't do if you're stressed and you would think it would add to the stress but I know that I'm okay when I can do this effectively. Plus it makes me smile.
__label__1 I think this game was the best game I have ever seen in my life. I would decently get it. If my brother didn't get it I wouldn't be able to do this .......GET THIS GAME.
__label__1 I had this one my phone and I love it because it's so awesome boom bam I love animals so if you love fish get this

__label__0 All these five star reviews, has anyone looked at the permissions?! They can see your phone, text data, all sorts of crap!
__label__0 You cant catch a fish easy. When you try and get the fish after you get a bite, you cant get it and it says &quot; almost &quot;.I recommend don't get it because after all of the struggle,  you get aggravated.
__label__1 this is very fun to play.I love it:)!!!there are so many fish you can catch but it is hard to get pearls

__label__1 aqua pets is so addicting u can catch rare and lengary and common creatures. put the different fish in ur tank and view the fish u have caught.
__label__0 couldn't even download it! says its too larve for a mobile network please try again when gou have a wifi connection. i turned on my wifi and still couldnt download! -droid2
__label__1 I have been playing for a few days now and I love all the fun fish you can collect, plus it gives you an aquarium to view all your favorites as they swim around happily.  =P  I encountered a problem with the feature that allows you to link the game to yo
__label__1 LOVE!!!!!!!!!!!I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS APP AND RECOMEND IT TO ANYONE!!!!This is the #1 app I play and I highly recommend it but for the creators here's some suggestions....EASIER WAY FOR PEARLS!!!Maybe like a pearl for every 4 petz you catch.TAKE AWAY FHE
__label__1 It's a awesome game but I've gotten over 50 rare kinds of pets but no legendary petsif you want legendary PET you pearls.
__label__1 This game is so addicting I LOVE it!!!!!!!!!!!LOVE IT!!LOVE IT!!!LOVE IT!!!you get to talk to your friends and visited their tanks!!! Get this app and add me as a friend. BeachyBrooke is my name in the app!!!

__label__1 i luv this game so much!!!! it is so cool to see the different types of fish thhat you can catch
__label__1 It's super addicting, and my kids love it too. My five year old gets so excited when she gets a fish she's never caught before.
__label__1 I had to download this for my son so he could stop playing all my games.He had played it before and got hooked!!!
__label__1 I have used this app for two years  on 5 different  Android phones and has made it very easy to keep it clean and running well just a few clicks.
__label__1 Believe it or not, there are actually decent apps on ammazon for android phones. This is one of them.  I have not found a second decent app here yet.  If someone finds the other decent app be a good sport and let the rest of us kbow.Peace baby
__label__1 Excellent application! Works as described. I wrote to the Dev about an update pop-up I didn't understand &amp; before I left my email, the was not only a &quot;fix&quot; already implemented but also a highly courteous &amp; professional email reply addre
__label__1 Nice app to erase history after searching items on various web sites you visited. Does a great job on the Kindle Fire HD. Clears up space no longer needed on your device. I like to clear everything after searching around all sites visited. Makes my Kindl
__label__1 it keeps me entertained for a long time pandora and this together it is amazing get it!! its just what i was looking for works great oon kindle fire
__label__0 I'm not even sure what this is besides rolling two dice, would be nice it it was actually a game.
__label__1 This is one thorough app...you can check your balances, check the markets, transfer funds and make trades. It has watch lists and quotes; what more could you want in an app...I seldom see apps that do as much as this one. Very well designed.ShareBuilder 
__label__0 Probably my fault but I was looking for Capitol One app that I could use on my kindle fire with no luck.
__label__0 Not really Kindle Friendly.  You can check your account, but not much of anything else.  Seeing as you cannot get on their website on the Kindle Fire HD for some reason it is not compatible... but you cannot do anything with banking, etc.
__label__0 I haven't able to transfer it my phone properly. I plan on trying again.I hope I can be sucvessful in the next go around.
__label__1 This App is very easy to use and it is constantly being updated.  The only thing I have found that I cannot do is change the amount or date on a payment that I have already set up to be paid.
__label__1 Sharebuilder Mobile works so well on my Kindle Fire, I prefer it to the Internet version! Excellent is the word.
__label__0 My app is telling me to download a new version so I did,and it is still taking me to download a new version. So where is the new version.As of August 2013 The New app is running fine.
__label__0 This was not the mobile banking app that I was looking for, so I did not like it. I was not able to access my peculiar account. It may be great for someone that have share in Capital One.
__label__0 it is only good for Capital one brokerage account.So do not install if if you want to use it to access any other account
__label__1 Convenient way to check my accounts from my phoneEasy to use and navigate. I would recommend it to anyone with a shatebuilder account
__label__1 it's an excellent app i have the web site on computer but definetly like it better on the kindle, thanks
__label__0 No matter what I've done to try and get this to work on my KFHD, it crashes before I can even put in my login credentials.  From the reviews it looks like not much can be done in terms of trading from the App anyway but I'll never know since it doesn't w
__label__1 If you have an account with ShareBuilder, I highly recommend this app. It lets you easily manage your account while you are away from your laptop.
__label__0 I came upon this after doing a Kindle Fire app search for &#34;ING Direct&#34;.  Since I have an ING account, two credit cards through Capital One and an auto loan, I figured this would be phenomenal. Nope...there's nothing to log into besides any stocks
__label__0 I encourage everyone to report an issue w/this app w/Amazon. I just did. You'll find the link on the product description page (1st tab). Here's hoping they'll fix it!
__label__1 I like being able to check on my account when  I want to, instead of having to wait until my computer finally gets the net. It makes things alot easier.  Thanks
__label__1 it is a lot better than the one I had on my iPhone. very nicely done game. inspire 4g :)
__label__0 I don't like this game.  I just didn't think it was worth down loading.  The description sounded better than the app.
__label__0 Farkle Live is so stupid. it totally rigs ir for the other person. it rigs it for the other person everytime I play. it SUCKS ALL THE THE TIME.
__label__0 I HAD TO COME BACK AGAIN TO SEE IF OTHER BUYERS HAD THE SAME PROBLEM WITH THIS GAME...AND SOME DID...U CAN NOT WIN ...DICE IS STACKED AGAINST U ..SO DO'T TRY...I AM DELETEING IT..A BONETTI
__label__1 Love this game, super addicting! Unfortunately not for multiple players :( Has good customizable capabilities for different rules and such.
__label__1 I have the actual farkle game so I decided to try this out and it is awesome.  other people said that there screen shrunk but I don't know what the heck their talking about.
__label__1 I love playing Farkle on the internet and having it on my Kindle is great! It's an addictive game, but I absolutely love it!
__label__1 love this game, but be careful  you too can get addicted and the hours just fly by. have played other versions but i like this one best.
__label__1 This is the best game I've played in a long time.  Love having it on my Kindel Fire when sitting and waiting for an appointment.  Would recommend to everyone.
__label__0 Once again, not as I expected. Was searching for the same game as on my iphone. Would not recommend.to my friends.
__label__1 In my house we play this and it's just called Dice, and we have that 3 pairs is 3,000 points 12345 is 1,500 and 123456 is 1,600, also six of the same number is that number to the 1,000, if one then 10,000. This are rules I think should be added.Love the 
__label__1 "Farkle" is a fun, almost addictive dice game that can be played against a computer opponent or even another person (by handing the device back and forth). The game took me a little bit of time to figure out, but once the scoring and strategy became clea
__label__1 We had a great time playing this together on vacation.  So much easier than carrying dice and paper to the beach!  I like that you can play the computer, and select the type of opponent you want.  Or, you can play with friends and pass the phone around. 
__label__1 Love this app. Easy to learn and play. Part luck, part strategy (in as much as taking the chance on rolling what you need is strategy). It's a good way to pass the time and keep yourself occupied.
__label__1 I really do like this game, no thought needed at times. But I do think the game doesn't get as many Farkles as the person playing! Needs to be fairer. I would recommend it to others though.
__label__1 I had never played or had even heard of this game.  It is fun, a little addicting.  Not much thinking too it. just fun
__label__0 this is a complete. rip of you never ever ever win its always someone else boo boo boo stupid idiotic
__label__1 i can see how it could really be fun with freinds.  works well off of the SDCard as well.  this one is a keeper.  i have dowloaded plenty of games, but find most don't play well with smaller screen.
__label__1 I love playing Farkle with friends and when I have no one to play with, this makes up for it!
__label__1 I love farkle, and this is a great no-nonsense app. I also like the &#34;Western&#34; theme where you can play different computer characters like Wyatt Earp, all with different strategies and skill levels. 2 thumbs up!
__label__1 I love Farkle, and this app makes it easy to play on the go.  The app is smooth, I've had no bugs and the best part is you don't have to add your own points ;)I also highly enjoy the fact that you can toggle the rules.  There are many different rule vari
__label__1 I love this game. Great graphics and easy to play. Very addicting and well worth the download. Have lots of fun!
__label__1 Why is this Not available for the kindle Fire HD 8.9? I have it on my other kindle fire and I Love playing it... because it's an offline game! But, I still give it 5 stars! :)
__label__1 My kids love playing this game against each other and the ai.  There was an issue after an update and once the developers where informed of the issue and where very prompt in looking into it and keeping me posted on the resolution. Great game. Great comp
__label__1 Very fun game. It is perfect for when you have a little time to kill. I have no problems with the AI.
__label__1 One great thing about free games is you can choose the one you want & hopefully find one that's easy to play without a lot of complicated set-up or learning how. So it is with the farkle edition; you only get the classic game, but can play yourself, agai
__label__1 Iv'e played this game on lots of other electronic devices. I love it on my Kindle. I play it daily. If you like Dice games,you will like this one.
__label__1 This game is my favorite on facebook so I thought I would get it on the kindle works the same and fun
__label__1 FarkleThe only problem with this game is it is addictive!  I love it and play way too much.  It has cut into my reading and crocheting time.  :-)  My Mom burned my kids out on this game when they were young but now are ready to play it again in memory of
__label__1 Liked this game - HATED the update that shrunk the playing area (several May '12 reviews address this). VERY glad to say that it's been fixed! Back to the easy controls and great playability, which gets it a five-star rating from me. Also - as far as AI 
__label__1 Just like you remembered only without the gambling... Fun game.  Developers did a great job with the interface and the graphics. One small criticism - in order to leave the game you have to touch the "play again" button (a little counter intuitive don't 
__label__1 I found this first on Facebook. Not having an account anymore I'm glad to find it here.  An excellent game to pass time, and challenge friends. The settings for the game here are much better to those on Facebook. There are no power ups, which sometimes f
__label__0 Gets boring way too fast. Don't bother wasting your time with this one. Also loling at all of the reviews obviously written by the developer.
__label__1 so I just played with my farkle two days ago and today when I went on to play all my screens r very tiny and hard to see. I went to settings but no way to change. ne one else having this problem?
__label__1 We have the physical game and this is pretty good. It's a fast paced game when you only have a few minutes for a quick one. I do wish the board was a little bigger, seems like a lot of wasted space. I've even won a few times, which is nice.
__label__0 I can not comment on this as I have never used it. I can not comment on this as I have never used it.
__label__1 LOVE this game..... great for waiting for appointments, etc.  Best of all it was FREE as well as very fun !!!
__label__0 There aren't any directions. I've heard of the game but never could figure out how to play. I was disappointed
__label__0 force closed the first try.  tried again and it played but wouldn't allow me to select the dice that I wanted to choose... it chose for me each time... then force closed again... uninstalled... Samsung galaxy S
__label__1 Great game and easier than the dice version. Hours of fun! Have you farkled today? Don't worry about bad rolls or lost dice. The game keeps score for you.
__label__1 New update fixed small sized graphics issue, and Farkle score sounds have changed. Slick new game winner interface too. I love this game - have to play it a couple of times before sleeping!  Quick to learn and fun to play, and will allow several people t
__label__1 I'm picky when it cones to games. this one is fun and simple. thanks. nervous nell is a Cheater, LOL
__label__1 We realy enjoy the Farkle App! You can set up the scoring in a variety of ways, depending on how you learned to play it. Works great!
__label__1 farkle is a totally addicting dice game. my boyfriend and i even try to play with each other. its soo much fun!
__label__1 This is an excellent game.  Easy to under stand and enjoyable to play and is a game that you can play for a long time.
__label__1 l've played this game on facebook - but I love the fast pace and the voices on the Kindle Fire, very fun!
__label__1 I needed a fresh game to challenge my brain. It is easy to use.  Good graphics.  Thanks for making it available.
__label__1 You never know who is going to win this game until the end.  That sneaky cpu will get you past you just when you think you have the game.
__label__1 I love this game and I especially love that this one is extremely fast paced when you want it to be. Face it, this is mindless fun. I don't need a lot of bells and whistles and this meets my expectations for a good game that is user friendly.
__label__1 This fast-paced game is highly addictive and you can even play it with ONE player.  Farkle has been around since the Renaissance period, so it is a true time-tested, very enjoyable, and addictive game for all ages!
__label__1 never have I ever felt so challenged playing dicegood game. would highly recommend this game to family and friends.love it love it
__label__1 A must download! A real time killer.  If you never played this, you will become addictive.  You can easily pass & play to friends around a table or in the car on road trips.
__label__1 Nice simple game, very addictive, nice design.  Have to play at least three games a day.  Love this game, recommend this to anyone who needs small time to pass.
__label__1 Good version of Farkle. You can play against the computer or up to three friends.  Works great on Kindle fire HD.
__label__1 Currently one of my favorite games. Winning involves a combination of luck and stategy. Games are relatively short, which is good when you just need a short break from current task.
__label__0 It was fun but I hadn't even played it five min. And it locked up.  I enjoyed it, but got tired of rebooting my kindle.....
__label__0 I have &#34;Farkle Addict&#34; on my I phone and I LOVE that game. This one does not allow you to play a 1 person game and that is how I enjoy playing Farkle. Usually play it when I don't have much time to play, like when waiting in a Dr office. I wish y
__label__1 Bought the Kindle just so I can play this game.  You don't need a partner, it already gives you one.  Wish I didn't need to be hooked up to WiFi to play so i could take it on vacation.
__label__1 This game is one I play everyday.  It is very addictive and easy to understand and play. I recommend it to anyone looking for something to do while in a waiting room or to simply pass time.
__label__1 I first found Farkle on Facebook and thought it was a fun dice game. I was happy to see a free version of it for my new Android tablet.This rendition of Farkle doesn't disappoint at all. From the fun themed opening screen to the smooth animations and fun
__label__1 I like playing Farkle and sometimes it is hard to stop! Would like the option to play other people...but it is free
__label__0 I've not used this app, so I can't really comment on it.  Strill will try it out.  I will try it tomorrow night.
__label__1 Fun game, easy to use on the tablet, keeps my soon occupied during Dr visita plus it helps with math skills
__label__0 The game cheats.  The way the game plays I should be the one winning most of the time.  But most of the time as I am getting a larger score the computer suddenly has large rolls.  The game is biased not truly based on random dice rolls.  DO NOT LIKE GAME
__label__1 I absolutely love Farkle Dice. I play it every day, and I win quite often which is odd for me, I'm usually not real lucky. Love it!!!!
__label__1 This is not the same as Facebook but once you get use to it it is as just as much fun.
__label__1 The game offers options including number of players and different names for NPCs.  For a quick game to play while waiting in line or in an office, it certainly delivers in entertainment.
__label__1 Great little time waster. Works very well.As to the 1 star reviews,Try contacting the author if you have a problem before you rate an item. As you can tell from the comments this one is VERY responsive!Umm, there are instruction! Try your menu key, or on
__label__1 This game is really fun! It is challenging and yet I can still beat the opponent sometimes too! I love it!
__label__1 I play on this app all the time! I love it. I have not had any problems with it! great app
__label__1 I have down loaded this app for my two kids also.  They game is very simple and my kids love playing.
__label__1 Love this game its one you can play alone or with someone. You can play the computer as well, so this makes it nice.
__label__1 Pretty authentic version of Farkle with only small ads (so far, at least). I've played two games against the AI and won both, so I don't think it's fixed (although the AI did have a really impressive run at the end when it was trying to go out). Definite
__label__1 i play this game a lot great fun play against the computer a game of chance i hate it when i get a game and find out i have to pay to play more this is free!
__label__1 it works well just 1 problem u cant play with other friends or random ppl nd tht sucks alot but at least u can.play sumthin if ur bored
__label__1 Awesome - no glitches - works well - thanks for a great game.  I'm now adding words because they are making me.
__label__1 I have a lot of fun with this game...it's easy, fun and cute...oh, did I mention it's quite addictive?...I could play this one for hours!
__label__1 Great version of a classic dice game.  I have tried a few different versions of this game and this is the one I kept.  This was 10 times better then most of the others, only one other one was even close.  If you like Farkle, you'll love this app.
__label__1 Takes a little getting the hang of how the scores work but a lot of fun. Play against android player. Great time killer for pedicure ot at doctor's office. Fast paced game so you never get bored. Get it!!! Droid X
__label__1 I played at the FireCo. on Fri. &amp; Sat. nites with the guys , with real dice, I'm so delighted to see an app like this for my KF...... thank you
__label__1 Can easily be handed back and forth between 2 or more people while waiting on a table or food to be delivered to your table. Great for families! Would work at a waiting room, or while waiting in a line or for kids (and us grown folks) on a road trip! LOV
__label__0 After many attempts at this game I realize its not me that sucks its this game.  Every word I created out of the letters given was not correct. The words you are supposed to make are only indicated with ----- dashes.  Only good thing is it's free.  What 
__label__1 get it it helps with scramble with friends awsome ness best little aawsome game ever woot woot woot woot woot woot!!!!
__label__0 I found the graphic setting dull and the game play frustrating not all of the possible words of a given group of letters are included just the words the game's creator thought of unlike the great classic word game Text Twist where every possible word com
__label__0 I haven't read the rules, but it had tiny letters and words.  It looks like it should have matched the way Word Mix Lite works.  It doesn't.  Because it was so hard to read the screen, I just uninstalled.
__label__1 My husband and I love this app!! We sleep wonderfully listening to  &quot;Rain on a tin roof&quot; (Hubbys fave) and I nap very well while listening to &quot;Beach 2&quot; or &quot;Beach 4&quot;...Great Purchase!!!!!
__label__1 For people who don't sleep well at night, this app is for you. You can choose any type of tone or combine any 3 sleep tones of your choice and timer, those tones will put you to sleep within 2-3 hours. I use this every night and I feel ready to go every 
__label__1 I love this app, I have stored my favorite sounds - thunder, rain & thunder. I swear I fall asleep so much faster than w/o the app. My kids also love just hearing all the different sounds
__label__1 Best sleep app out there and totally worth the money!! I've tried expensive sleep sound devices and this beats the expensive devices hands down!! Great for vacations or just a simple weekend getaway - I have a hard time sleeping anywhere but in my own be
__label__1 This is great, esspecially when I'm away from home. It has all kinds of sounds and different versions of the same sounds. (like different types of frogs, or crickets w/ and w/o other sounds) and you can layer them for the perfect effect. My favorite is t
__label__1 I purchased this app without really knowing if I wanted/needed white noise for sleeping. Honestly, I thought it was kind of silly. Then I tried it - wow! You can choose from so many sounds, layer them, adjust the volume of each one (birds not so loud, ra
__label__1 This app is great and worth paying for to get all the sounds.  And there are so many to choose from.  Love it!
__label__1 I use this app every night. The nature sounds really lull me to sleep. It is like camping in your bedroom.
__label__0 I don't know how anyone could fall asleep listening to these sounds. Many of the sounds are on such a short constant loop, you can hear them start and stop with an audible click several times in one minute. How can you shut down your brain if you just kn
__label__1 I CANNOT BELIEVE THIS!!!!!! This is an amazing app, totally helps you sleep! I would even pay up to $50 on here!!!!!! It's amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!
__label__0 It has allot of different ambiance style sound bites, but none of  them are very good and each sound has to be individually downloaded from the internet, so it takes allot of time to figure out it isn&#8217;t that good.
__label__1 I love this app!! Sleeping with chronic snoring partner has never been more peaceful. When sleepy time is on my brain blocks the snoring and focuses on the sweet sounds of ocean, rainstorm, river, whatever. Best lifestyle app ever! Finally 6 hours of res
__label__1 This app is superb! I generally set it to go for 45 minutes but it puts me out long before (as far as I can tell). I like crickets and dryer. A bunch of great combos, actually. A marvel of good thinking!
__label__1 I love this app!!!  There are so many variations of sounds that you can put together to fit every mood.  I have tinnitus really bad and since I started listening to this app at night, I fall right to sleep.  I like the fact that it has a timer so it auto

__label__1 it's a pretty good app buy it I highly recommend it I like it very much you won't regret buying it it is worthy
__label__1 I tried the free version and liked it so well with the limited features that I thought &quot;shucks,  for the price of a bottle of pop,  why not try the paid version?&quot;  It isworth every penny!If you need a sleep noise generator,  you can't get bette
__label__1 Just what you hope it is,  better.  You will enjoy blending your own symphony of sound and tailoring them to your liking.  I use this all time now.  Worth more than I paid.  I encourage the people who worked on it to continue to to improve on this wonder
__label__1 I've used this app while traveling for work. It's nice to fall asleep with in an unfamiliar hotel. lots of sound choices and works great om Moto XOOM.
__label__1 I like it because I can have something to listen to at night besides music and the ringing in my ears. The white noise is easier to sleep to than music or the ringing in my ears.
__label__1 i originally downloaded the lite version but it did not have many sound features so i upgraded to the full version and i use it every night to help me fall asleep. i love the crickets and the campfire you can also set a timer to shut off the sounds. i lo
__label__1 Works fantastic in my Kindle FIRE! Everything downloaded perfectly. So much better than a high priced unit that takes up space on the dresser. I can take this anywhere...even WORK!
__label__1 I started out with the lite version of this app and was really impressed, but a lot of the sounds I wanted weren't available.  I went ahead and bought this one and I don't regret it at all!  I really like the feature that you can play up to 3 sounds toge
__label__1 Since moving into an apartment for college, leaving home the sounds of the countryside including crickets, frogs, and the woodstove, I have fell in love with this app. The campfire 1 sound is my favorite, along with rain 2, thunderstorm 2, and row boat t
__label__1 I have always had trouble falling asleep...until now. This sounds are so amazing on my Kindle Fire.  There are so many unique sounds to choose from and many standard relaxing ones as well.  I was truly amazed at how easily the thunderstorm has been putti
__label__1 I've had this app over six months.  I love that you can layer sounds or just listen to one. The rain with thunder is awesome. I listen to that sometimes when I'm reading - it's so relaxing.
__label__1 amazing,  I started with the free version of this game.  it was good,but I quickly decided that for 1.49 the paid version is super.  so many sounds to choose from and I love how sounds can be layered.  for years I have slept rarely more than a few hours 
__label__1 I love this app!! I'm bad at getting to sleep at night but its really easy with this! I completely recommend the whale noise!
__label__1 Extremely realistic, soothing app. Love the 3 layer effect with 80 sounds from which to choose. Works perfectly on the Kindle Fire.
__label__1 ... someone who's used 'noise' since well into the last century to cover up noise to get to and stay asleep!  Thanks...
__label__0 Big mistake! Uninstalled it! Bought this after listening to different sounds on the free version (you will see with the rest of my original review how happy I WAS). What the heck is up with the silence every 60 seconds on the loop? How can you expect peo
__label__1 Great App! I work night shift and I use it to coverup the noises made by the daywalkers, street noise and those damn cheerful birds :) Get this app if you work nights.
__label__1 very nice app. sounds great. you can even combine up to three sounds at the same time. sounds like the beach, birds, wind. DROID X
__label__1 I sleep to the sound of the forest and a campfire. This reminds me of Summer in the Adirondacks. thank you!
__label__1 Amazingly high sound quality and fantastic selection of sounds.  Really helps with relaxing and very enjoyable.  I do hope they let us have a favorites button at some point.Oh, you can also run more than one sound at a time...  my kids love messing with 
__label__1 I managed to set up two different "layered" sounds within a couple of minutes after downloading this app. I set it to "rain, thunder and wind" and was asleep before the "timer" ran out at 15 minutes.  Woke up in the middle of the night, as usual, and ins
__label__1 I am absolutely thrilled with this app.  I don't buy many but this one is more than worth the price if you are a person who needs a little white noise to go to sleep.  I am accustomed to sleeping with a fan on and when I travel it is extremely difficult 
__label__1 campfire #2 on because I like pops so BUY IT. BUYERS BEWARE. beef best best best game ever should buy works on kindle
__label__1 I thought this might be a good app to run instead of wasting $ on a real fan or air conditioners, but what I found was a pleathora of sounds that can be mixed in nearly countless ways to get the exact sound you want.  I live near mountains, and this app 
__label__1 This has been very helpful to me.  There are so many sounds to choose from, some that surprise me.  There are several Beach sounds... from gentle lapping lake waves up through the ocean crashing with a fog horn and seagulls in the background, and a coupl
__label__1 I often have trouble sleeping, especially at dialysis. Sleepy Time is the perfect solution! All the sounds are realistic(though some are a tad puzzling or even downright annoying, such as the red and brown noises). I like that you have so many sounds to 
__label__1 Love this app it does what it says sounds r AWESOME!  Lots of sleep timer choices.  u really should buy this!!!
__label__1 This has helped immensely, when on the road, in a strange new hotel, this helps ground me. I can concentrate on the wonderful variety of sounds, suited to my liking. Can fall asleep faster and easier, if need be can set the timer for the entire night and
__label__1 Excellent app.  What sets this apart from other apps is that you can mix multiple sounds to create that perfect sound.  Worth every penny if you have a hard time getting to sleep as I do.
__label__1 Sleepy time was worth every penny! I bought this app and have not been disappointed yet!  HUGE selection of sounds (one request please, crackling fireplace?)  They have everything from rain, camping, truck idle, fan sounds, beach, white noise, crickets, 
__label__1 I use this every night while I drift to sleep.  my favorite is &quot; thunderstorm 2&quot;.  set it for whatever time you like, and rest easy.
__label__0 If u need a great sleep app try 'Relax melodies'white noise app. Not only is the sound far better- butcher you can pick more than 3 combos AND you can save multiple. favorite combos. It has ocean -storm -ac-music-zen etc tons of great selections without 
__label__1 I've actually put off buying this app for a long time waiting for Lightning Bug to be available on the Amazon Appstore. Then one day I just decided I would buy this app just to try it. Even though Lightning Bug is now also available on Amazon, I have no 
__label__1 Love this app. I listen to ocean waves everynight when I go to bed. Sounds like you are laying right on the beach. There is still some things I don't understand how to do but have not taken the time to figure it out but it has been worth it. Love it and 
__label__1 There are so many different sounds available and the ability to have 1,2, or 3 sounds playing at the same time AND give you full control of the volume for each different sound takes the cake.  I&apos;m unable to sleep without the help of Medicine. Last n
__label__1 Yeah, I know...I know. No such thing as a commonly used smartphone or tablet back in 2000. If there had been, I would have saved a bloody fortune at Sharper Image, buying one after another of their "Sound Soother" machines. I had the BIG ones, I had the 
__label__1 I love this app so much. it works great and dose not lag AT ALL. It helps me sleep and take Mg mind off things. But you have to download sounds if you want them. I would recommend this app to anybody who has trouble sleeping........
__label__1 I remember going to my grandma's house when I was little. She has this big grandfather clock in her living room and I would love to sleep on the couch just to fall asleep to the ticking sound it made. The sound here is very close to that old grandfather 
__label__1 This app has never begged me for a review. I keep the two soundtracks on, Crickets 1 and Crickets 2, constantly, going on now for months, at about 3/8 volume, night and day. Most people never seem to notice. I have not heard a single comment or inquiry. 
__label__1 this works I fell asleep so fast I could not beleave it gosh this app really works it tricked me in to thinking I was camping
__label__0 We haven't figured the point of this yet. I think ant tv show works too. I uninstalled this. It might just be my lack of understanding
__label__1 This is wonderful. My favorite sound to fall asleep to is 'Rainy Drive' which is a soothing sound of a realistic car drive in the rain complete with windshield wipers, rain, and the occasional car passing by. I set it for 45 mins and fall asleep before t
__label__1 This has so many sounds to choose from and it plays till you fall asleep. If  you have trouble getting to sleep this app is for you..
__label__1 I set my timer for 1 hour and I don't think I've heard past the first 10 minutes! I fall fast asleep so relaxed every night! It's wonderful!!!!
__label__1 Im a " white noise" kind of guy and I love all of the customizable sounds. The sounds were far better quality than I had expected. I will have to agree with those who say some of the clips are too short which can sometimes be noticeable as they loop. Ove
__label__1 People this is the real deal.  It does what it says AND THEN some. whether you're a light sleeper or you crash right away there is a perfect sound for everyone. solo easy to use, just awesome
__label__1 This app is amazing. I love the rain sounds and the beach sounds, but my favorite is Frogs 1. Very calming and well worth the $1.50!!
__label__0 the sounds on this app are not good for trying to sleep at all. just sounds like irritating noise. I'm definitely going to try and get a refund.
__label__1 I can fall asleep with put a cat purring or someother calming noise to me. ever sends my cay passed away I found this a great way to for me to still feel like my 23 year old cat is still there with me.
__label__1 I enjoy this app for it's beautiful sound. The white noise seemed a little off, but babbling brook is my favorite one, and it's better than that girl named brook I. my class babbling on and on about nothing. :)
__label__1 I am one of those people who have a hard time sleeping without some sort of white noise in the background. What I had been using for white noise stopped working a long time ago, and I never had a chance to replace it.Since this app was discovered for my 
__label__1 I picked this a couple weeks ago as a source of background noise while I was falling asleep. Its been exceptional so far. I was quite impressed with the huge list of available tracks to play. Its pretty safe to say that everyone will find at least one th
__label__1 I've used this app for lengths of time and not had an issue with sound gaps as others have reported. I think this app is great and worth the money. some of the sounds could be better like the clothes dryer has some noises made by the person recording it 
__label__0 This app is ok for some people that like to drop off to sleep if you have the internet hooked up. Saddley the internet can not be everywhere. This is not part of the avertisment that you have to have internet hooked up in order to use this app. other wis
__label__1 I love this app. There are so many wonderful sounds to relax or fall asleep to. I frequent the thunderstorm sounds on my nightly slumber. Great sound quality and I can set the amount of time I want it to play; which is good since 95% of the time I fall a
__label__1 This app is amazing on my Kindle Fire. It is multitask capable so you can read or surf the web while listening. The sound choices are varied &amp; sound terrific! Well worth the $1.49 I paid!!
__label__1 Excellent app that allows a combination of sounds with variable volume. If you hear a gap in sounds when the track repeats, it is because of your particular version of android (most ics high end devices), not because of a problem with the app.
__label__1 I first downloaded this App 12/01/2011 - It was excellent for folks who need "white noise" to sleep. My wife and I used it all night for a restful sleep ("Air Conditioner" setting worked best for us). HOWEVER:UPDATE 01/30/2013 - PROBLEM WITH LOOP - REMOV
__label__1 I bought this app because a friend of mine said it was great... I absolutely love it. You can set the sleep timer for as long as you want and the sounds are so realistic, sometimes I wake up thinking that it's actually raining outside.  I has really help
__label__0 I love word games, but this one I did not enjoy at all. I tried several times to get into it and just could not.
__label__1 works great on my k.f. which is what I was looking for I recommend to people who people who like word games
__label__1 This is  fun game to play. Fun to see how many words you can get and beat the clock. It will surprise you when you try it.
__label__0 don't like anything about this game......will, except maybe for not spending any money on it.hate having to write a certain amount of words for the review
__label__1 This was a fun game, the levels were challenging and easy. It keeps my mind sharp and challenged.  Great game.
__label__1 I love this game. Some days I just go on and on, others I can't seem to build enough words. But it is definitely a great game!
__label__0 I don't get it cuz all I do is press da numbers dat is on da screen and it give me points. word chain on gameshow channel is diffrent. ex: on diz word chain u make words out of the letters on the screen with da one on gameshow they put a word on da board
__label__0 Probably my fault I really don't understand the game.  And the directions from the beginning of the application when you choose the game doesn't make sense to me.
__label__1 I like games that  make me think and Word Chain is one of those. It's even addicting. I am 82 years old and my two daughters gave me this Kindle Fire "so I would not get alzemiers". I like challenging games, love Majgong and have to admit I first did not
__label__0 I would've read this program 0 stars but the marketplace won't  allow  0 star reviews. this program is a complete and utter waste of time not entertaining not enjoyable and should be removed from the download section.
__label__1 For all of you who complained, you do not under stand that this is a physics app.  Not a game.
__label__1 sasa erwin? What are u thinking. just don't gte an app h dint like gosh! for people who dint like it, its awesome.
__label__0 all you do is pull and rip a cloth, really?  that is so boring and annoying how can people stand that.  don't fey this app
__label__1 Okay so if you don't like physics and stuff don't suggest getting it... But overall it is interesting and it is very much like cloth movement, sadly there are no options to change things a bit but overall pretty great!
__label__1 I am a phisics freak, so I love this game. Great for kindle fire! Get it! It really does give you real movement and simulation. I highly recommend. this!
__label__0 All this company text based games text based games suck. if you see a game with their sign over it then it's a text based game and sucks don't listen to the other reveiws it will SUCK!!!!!!!!!!!!!
__label__1 i loved it but found star legends love the new game fun play sl better less boring I'm Superjel there:D
__label__1 I absolutely love this game, the community is super friendly. While playing on my kindle the battery does decrease at a faster rate, but you can also play with a slower connection. You can also connect the app to facebook and play it there.
__label__1 I have been playing for a long time and have had no issues with this app. It is a great game and work just fine on the kendle fire. so the review about it not working on the kendle fire is wrong. if you like a great community you will like this game.
__label__0 I got this game thinking it would be the best, with fighting,  monsters, and quests. I was very dissapointed when I got it. You just press a button, wait a few minutes, and then a result pops up. You don't even see it happen! This game is NOT what it loo
__label__0 This game was really fun and I enjoyed it but uken banned me from it so I'm kind of madI reset my profile and they give me my file back then ban me for no reasonAnd from what I heard the game has become corruptSo play at your own risk
__label__1 just as in uken's fow there are different strategies you can approach the game from. If your looking for a stategy game instead of a aim and fire game you may well like this one. On one hand it is very easy and on the other hand it could be frustrating m
__label__1 Similar to the other uken games. Great support, if you need it. Keeps my geek coming back for long time.
__label__1 This is the most amazing online app I have ever played. I don't know why, but it reminds me a little bit of skyrim. add me (ixskw)
__label__1 I have a Kindle Fire and I thoroughly enjoy playing Age Of Legends on it! its really awesome and I think everyone should give it a try. but warning!! it IS very addictive. :-) have fun and add me to your guild if ya want: MIRWL
__label__1 so this is my fav uken game i like rpgs like this but none of my friends in real life do but this is fun ive been playing for over a year!
__label__1 great stratigic game. but forces of war is better.it is very fun you go on missions and battle rivals.scoots it angry birds age of legends in the house!
__label__0 A terrible knock off of Castle Age. Even free not worth the download graphics are like a toddler's drawings at best.
__label__0 This is not a good game and its as rotten as eggs! It's a cool-looking Dragon on it and all it is is a game that's no better then sitting on the floor for an hour! THIS IS NOT FUNNY. Do Not buy.
__label__1 My favorites are:Dark GalaxyForces of WarThe StreetsI really do enjoy Uken and text based apps, and don't complain that you cant do anything. If you don't like it just delete and play other games. I have all of the games by Uken, so I do know what I'm ta
__label__1 Great app overall. I love the bounty idea in it. I found myself at 12 at night stalking the bounty list.But if you don't love Mafia Wars and those sort of games, don't download it.
__label__1 this game is for people with patients. it is a very fun facebook rpg but you don't have to have a facebook account, it merely prompts you to add it. this is my fav Uken RPG game
__label__1 Finally a cool superhero/villain game for facebook! And another big plus is that it's a free app. I've spent way too much time waiting for my energy to load on the Sims Social. With an app, I can play anywhere and not waste time. To be honest, I would ne
__label__0 I couldn't even load the game. I don't have a facebook so this is a waste of my time. I was really hoping to play this game but I guess not. if you don't have a facebook do not get this game.
__label__1 I love this game! At first it may seem a bit boring but then it becomes the best app ever! You can chat with other people too! Get this app!!! You will LOVE it!
__label__1 This has got to be my go-to game of all time. When I can't get online to play for hours, I used to go through game withdrawal, LOL, but now I know at least I'm collecting billions of dollars per hour and building stamina, health, and energy to the fulles
__label__1 this game is awesome u can b a dragon a werewolf a witch Dr or 2 different creepy girls and different vehicals and lots of henchmen
__label__1 This game starts out a little slow and you need to spend about an hour with it before you can start realy playing the game. It is a awesome concept as you upgrade your empire and spend skill points, all while managing your money! The fight concept has a 
__label__1 In this game you ARE EPIC you choose where to focus your income so that no two gaming experiences are alike. This along with the ability to pick your own fights and fight your own wars makes this a simple complex experience. They start you with reasonabl
__label__0 You don't do anything in this game! You push a button and it says &#34;You win!&#34; there's no graphics or really any complex input whatsoever, save your money and your time and buy something else
__label__1 A game I pick up my kindle for. Fighting other real players, or a hero the game generates. My favorite part is the Empire, where your buildings generate money to spend on more buildings or henchmen. I reccomend 'Crime City' highly if you enjoy this.
__label__0 I give it zero stars it won't load it's good that it's free looks like a good game but it just won't load
__label__1 Awesome! totally worth it! oh and on age of legands... when u r a legend and want 2 change ur hero.. DON'T DO IT
__label__1 Granted it can't be your primary game, you have to wait minutes, hours, etc to gain points to spend on missions or battles. I play something else for a while, comeback, spend 5 minutes playing Villains--up my level, rinse and repeat. This isn't a "fun fo
__label__0 as I  see in the photos because i dont have the game.Its ANOTHER copy of the  game im just sayin
__label__1 I chose this particular app because I'm a huge comic book fan and I like the villains in the comic books.
__label__1 Games like these may be common, but are the best way to kill time when you just need to do something.
__label__1 So, when I got the game, I played and got to level 18!! This game is like an online game (It is, right?) that requires no username or password, just a villain name. This inspired me to start writing a book. About villains. Anyway,  I love this game and y
__label__1 A game like this deserves more respect I will give a few reasons why.1.The community:everyone is nice and don't act all nerdy like you would probably expect. Ukane games makes the same game in different versions to sell to a different community. (Ex. Wor
__label__1 this app is great. only one problem:-( when ever I try to select anything the screen blanks over. other then that it rules.
__label__0 Yet another &#34;create a character and tap buttons&#34; for 5 minutes before putting it down for 30 while your &#34;energy&#34; rebuilds. Boring. There are MANY better games out there.
__label__1 If you're a wordsmith, a spiritual seeker and/or a game player... And you have a sense of humor about those things, You will love this game. Not for the religious fanatics ... Delightful, pun filled, (my favorite humor) and non-committal... 3 of my favor
__label__1 After a couple of days, I find myself checking in on my heroine far more than is probably healthy.  As the description says and others have reinforced, there's really not a whole lot to do, other than keep up with your hero.The game's core is its humor; 
__label__1 I find this game to be witty and interesting. I don't have to sit there playing the game for hours. I really don't even have to run in and heal my hero when I'm alerted and I don't see it....he just runs away :)great little game for sure.
__label__1 its quite a fun app, all you have to do is check in every couple hours, and read his diary for a couple of laughs like&quot;11:58 Noticed a small inscription on my weapon: 'Warranty void if used against monsters'. Darn it!.I guess there's more deph to it
__label__1 Fantastic game, very addicting! Your hero does all the work, just heal him every once in a while. learn the commands from the Godville wiki and contribute to the community!Also, join the ranks of the Brotherhood of Steel, help us make a difference in the
__label__0 This was a great app until the last update.  Now it force closes every single time.  What is going on?
__label__1 I check my hero at least once a day. After awhile of reading his diary he seems alive and real.
__label__1 I love this, but if you don't play an RPG MMO, it may make no sense to you.  The sport names of monsters, the goofy drops just kill me!  I can't play my MMO at work, so looking in on my heroine throughout the day keeps me from jonesin.
__label__1 I'm kelly76,  Thanks! I'm loving the game... It's fun and I don't have to babysit it! I would love it if you all would add me!
__label__1 No heavy lifting here, but the developers tell you that upfront, in fact that's the point of the game. The game consists primarily of a running diary of your character's actions and the entries are hilarious.  Lots of thought. Clever.
__label__1 Really its just a modern tamagotchi, but its got enough difference to make it not nearly as annoying. Honestly a great time waster.
__label__1 This game is exactly like it should be. It does what it says it does. You should play this game.
__label__0 Just updated this app tonight and now it won't load. 100% broken now. Please fix. I love this game. Very disappointed!
__label__1 Very funny diary entries. When I need a quick laugh I just open this app and read about my hero. Keeps me smiling all day.
__label__1 interesting app. not really a game, more like those digital fish tanks where you can watch fake fish swim arround without having much contact. the little that you can do doesn't seem to effect the game much. it's like reading a book.
__label__1 .... ...  I t I s o k I h a t e t h e game top girl. s k l a
__label__1 This is the best game I have found. You can do as much as you want or nothing at all. It also has a great community of players. You can not go wrong with this game. Just create a hero and sit back.
__label__1 You just don't have to be serious to play this game. In fact, it's better if you aren't. Random events happen to a character you create, which is relayed to you via &quot;diary&quot; pages. Don't have time to &quot;play&quot; for a day or three? No worri
__label__1 i love it, this app is amazing. i find myself spending hours playing with it. i just wish that you could interact with your hero on a more, personal level, like talk with them.
__label__1 I love this app! I got it for the Kindel Fire and it was just so funny! I check it often. At the price tags of free, why not? My God name is Wintersmith
__label__1 make yourself a god and your own hero?!? plus fxt other heroes and funny thing the hero will say? on this one time when I sent the hero a message, my hero was eating lunch, and right after I gave her it, she says in her diary &quot;I choked on a peanut&q
__label__1 Revisiting review 7 months later:Still using this, still enjoying Godville.  It's a "Zero role playing game" - you aren't the adventurer, you're the deity and your mortal adventurer goes on quests and generally runs around.The text is full of puns and hu
__label__1 I check this game all the time even though I have little influence on my hero.  It makes me giggle!The cute dialogs from the battles.The little side shouts my hero sees from other God's to their heroes.It's just a fun time wasting addictive application!G
__label__1 good game get it funny funny funny funny fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun must have fun fun get app it is fun fun fun get app fun fun gunner than fun fun fun
__label__1 I am in love with this game!  it's the only game that has remained on my Kindle since I downloaded it. I check on my hero daily more than once a day but I can leave him if i need to.
__label__1 This game is so much fun I love it would reccomend it to people who have time to play very little but I check on it up to five times a day.
__label__1 I can't really call this a &quot;game&quot;. but whatever it is its fun. its kind of annoying that the hero doesn't always do what you say but still very entertaining.
__label__1 Funny wordplay, interesting game idea, though it's kind of a chore at first. Once you get past level ten things start looking better.
__label__1 awesome game. you won't like it if you like complete control. but its cool to watch. little control over hero but can punish or encourage them. light or dark.
__label__1 i am addicted to this game. ive made so many friends its pathetic. i havent met any at all. my god name is cattail
__label__1 I like this app for what it is. Really is quite funny, my hero is a coward though. He always runs from a fight.
__label__1 I have had this game for about 6 months..it doesn't take up all of my time and not a lot of action. I love it..check up in my little hero pretty often. Works great on my DROID2.
__label__1 I love this game! Usually I don't like text based games at all, but I love this game anyway. I love the things your hero says, its so funny. Try it, its freeeeeeeee!
__label__1 This is the most fun you can have while doing nothing! I love checking to see what my hero is up to and the random meetings of friends. My only complaint and it's a minor one is I wish we could resurrect pets easier. This is lots of fun. Give it a try &a
__label__1 easy to play. description says it all. kinda interesting to see what your hereo does on there own.thanks dev.
__label__1 This is a great game, and every gamer should give it a try. All the characters have a personality that you'll come to love
__label__1 It's like reading  the script to a really funny action comedy, except you have the occassional ability to ineract with your main character.  Love it!  I'm spreading the word at work.  Almost everybody is playing it now.  :-)
__label__1 I know I have created to many accounts. this is an awesome game but can u be nice enough to get rid of too many regrestrations plz.
__label__1 Been playing going on two years now and can probably count on my hand the number of days where I didnt check in.  Simple but great
__label__1 Great GameAdd Me:King-LeonidasThis is great for people with limited time, an IQ of over 50 who can read, and a good sense of humor.
__label__0 I bought the Kindle HDX earlier last week, that's another review. Seems that they don't transfer app information, so all games/apps clear, you have to begin again.Now for Godville; if you have this on a kindle, keep your info somewhere, because if you lo
__label__0 most people think this game (and I use the term loosely) is boring. And they're right. But even worse, after doing nothing for a day or 2, it wants you to start paying for more nothing. Boring and Stupid
__label__1 I know the point of this is that you don't have to do much. But I think there should  be more optional things we could do. Still I love this game and enjoy everything about it.
__label__1 been playing with this over a month now. great time waster when your bored. works great on htc thunder bolt and moto XOOM
__label__1 how did I not know this game existed before? while it is kinda hard to get used to having near zero control over the person,  this game never fails to amuse and entertain, which is the point of a game.  bravo.  :)I also don't understand some religious pe
__label__1 I love the concept of this game but I wish you had just a little bit more say in what your hero does. Currently, my hero runs away from almost every battle and spends all his money on alcohol. It was funny at first but now I just wish I could tell him to
__label__1 I love most everything about this game! From the other heros) es ) &amp; Gods (ess)  to the names of the monsters!  and dont forger the weapons!!
__label__1 An odd text based game with all the fun of a mock up version of an rpg without the real effort of doing more than simple minimum.  I am &quot;The Giving Tree&quot; if you want to be friends.
__label__1 I love this 'game.'  Then again, I love most RPGs and similar types.  If you are interested, then try it.  I won't promise that you will love it because I really think most people are hoping for more interaction and plot.  The game description is accurat
__label__1 I love checking on my heroine. This game is so funny. The creatures names crack me up every time.  I&apos;ve been recommending this game to my friends.
__label__1 Its a great game to pass time but why would you need wifi other than that a great game fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun
__label__1 I think this game is awesome I totally think you should get this game. It is really cool and entertaining.
__label__0 Boring so boring. It posts updates of what happened that are kinda funny but it became very boring very soon...
__label__1 you never get bored with this app there is unlimited things for your hero to find and do your hero might even meet other peaple
__label__1 I love this game! It's fun to watch what your hero gets into. The writing is hilarious, love the enemies and the items found.
__label__1 It's strange that a game in which there is so little to do is this addicting. I find myself opening the game four and five times a day to check on my hero and see what he's doing. The diary entries and game wiki are hilarious, which is a major bonus.
__label__1 It's fun to play and read. This app will give tons of happy cute sayings that will put a smile on your face
__label__1 No issues on dinc2. Strange but fun "game", that is entertaining but wont eat your life like an MMO. Ideabox is brilliant. :-) Looking forward to more updates.
__label__1 Godville is one of the few games that has survived the test of time on my phone.  If you give it a shot I think you will enjoy it too.
__label__1 Godville lets you play as a God (not THE God), and guide your hero through adventures. Without, you know, actually doing anything.Fun to read, no commitment.  Recommended.
__label__1 A little frustrating when my heroine keeps getting herself killed but I absolutely love all the silly things that happen in this game. It seems like every enemy name, every item, and every quest are jokes or puns and it never ceases to make me smile. I j
__label__1 I have to say, even with as little as you do to 'play' this game, it's really fun.  The running diary of the hero is hilarious. Thank you GGL. This game is simplistic yet awesome.
__label__1 This is what happens when those pocket pets from the nineties grow up, kinda.Think of those with a lot less interaction needed. You really don't control anything but it's more for entertainment. Seemingly a parody of rpgs.
__label__1 hilarious gameplay that pokes fun at every mmorpg in existence. combines mulitple memes and pop culture with classic puns for a rewarding experience.
__label__1 Funniest game ever! It isn't as demanding as other MMOs, but you'll always be playing! My Gods name is The 10th Hokage. Add me!
__label__1 Super cool game, but not very involved. I couldn't spend hours playing, but I can waste ten minutes. Its fun to read the things your hero puts in his diary.
__label__1 What a sweet app. Pretty in depth too sofar.  Original and addictive... Thank you for making it free too. Can't wait to see what new features will be added as it grows... Negative reviews from people who uninstall immediately, or because it was not simpl
__label__1 No need to think on this game. Kind of like owning an ant farm. You watch,  and sometimes help and sometimes hinder their lives.
__label__1 Is it possible for something to be a time-waster that doesn't take up any time? Anyway, a unique concept executed well. You don't have to check in constantly but it does reward close attention.
__label__1 this game requires little energy or attention but is loads of fun. I've played for one week now and love it. five stars all the way.
__label__1 My man is kicking b**t. What more could a God ask? This is an app that doesn't steal huge amounts of time and the tongue-in-cheek comments are truly amusing.
__label__1 I love this game.  I don't have a lot of free time to spend on gaming, which makes this pretty much perfect.  I can check in on my hero when I have time, laugh out loud at her absurd diary entries, and let the rest take care of itself.Be aware that all t

__label__1 The diary entries and situations that your hero runs into are hilarious. While technically, you don't even need to do anything for them to progress, just the ability to interfere in there lives makes this game incredibly fun and funny.
__label__1 reading other reviews, I agree that you need to have the right personality for this game. what I especially like is how it plays for you so you can divide your attention to other tasks... or just watch a movie or something. either way, I like it.
__label__1 I didnt like it at first but its hilarious and a lot of fun even though you truly do nothing. Reminds me of something WoW and DnD players would really enjoy. Can't get enough of it! ={D
__label__1 I love the low mantinence aspect of this game. I can't babysit something to keep it happy all day long, so this game is perfect for me, it gives you the occassional notification (about 1 a day) that let you know something important is happening...like hi
__label__1 This is a great un-game. Godville is an engagingly silly game that plays itself, with a small amount of influence from you, your player's god. My daughter and I have been managing our Godville characters for over a year now, and it is great to have it av
__label__1 This game takes the zpg genre to a new level. It's fun to watch your hero move through the world and give him or her a nudge now and then. Nicely done.
__label__1 low maintenance app with a sense of humor that never  gets dull. I love the idea that I don't have to check  it every minute.
__label__1 Neat little dog type game that plays by itself, you check in on your hero when you feel like it. I find myself checking on mine several times a day. Amusing diary, opponents and items/armor. I LOVE this game!
__label__1 This is good for anyone with a sense of humor.  although your direct control is impossible, it is a part that helps, and reflects, what the game is.
__label__1 This game is so easy and fun to play. I highly recommend this game for anyone. All you have to do is check up on your hero a couple of times a day!
__label__1 Crazy, simple and you literally do nothing!! If you have a vivid imagination and like RPGs, you will like this!!
__label__1 Awesome game. I don't usually go for these types of games (create an avatar, multi-player platform, etc. ) but Godville is great! As Goddess I don't have to do much... just watch my creation do my bidding. The game site is a great resource for help and j
__label__1 This is an excellent game.  It may be confusing at first, but you come to love it eventually.  I recommend this.
__label__1 I have been playing this game for months now, and I still love seeing all the references and puns in it. Wish my hero would listen more though...
__label__1 I love the funny entries. And there's no need to do any hard quests. Just get a free account and watch the hilarity ensure! XD
__label__1 If you're looking for a game to kill time, this is not for you.  However, if you'd like a brief distraction that will make you chuckle and not take up very much of your time, Godville is a very unique idea that will keep you entertained over several week
__label__1 This is a great 'game'.. I believe in God, but really? I can't believe there are people out there who actually get offended. This is only a 'game'.. a parody at that.. I, very much, enjoy playing this. That doesn't mean that I am disgraceful to the Lord,
__label__1 I was searching out free games on the Marketplace when I saw this, and figured I'd give it a quick spin. Overall I think this game (that might be stretching it a bit) is quite fun, and serves as an excellent and often highlarious diversion.Basically you 
__label__1 I can't understand how this game manages to be so addictive despite the fact that you don't actually do anything...much.  But my wife and I are both fully hooked, and we play on mobile and online ([...] too.
__label__1 I usually don't even like games like this without graphics but this one is actually very unique and fun...you can just let it do its thing and come back to it a few days later even and just check how your hero's doing, or you can spend more time on it an
__label__1 I really enjoy this game. It's simple, casual (for me) and it's entertaining no matter when I open it. It's a novel concept in mobile gaming and well-executed.
__label__1 A laugh a minute. Be as little or as much involved as you want. My hero does some crazy things...
__label__1 This game is awesome. It is very original and is very funny. It seems simple at first but has more depth to it than it appears to.
__label__1 I really like it. the entries are cute, his reactions are priceless, and the fact that I technically don't have to do anything but sometimes revive him is great.
__label__1 If I was dieing on a desert island with no food or water, a weak signal and one bar, I would waste the last moments of my sad life playing Godville.
__label__1 Love it. Provides lots of laughs, kudos to the devs. Can't wait to see their next project. Who knew not playing a game would be so entertaining?
__label__1 This game is entertaing and definitely worth the download. It's not hard to keep up with even if you don't check it often and full of funny updates. I highly recommend it.
__label__0 Force closing on my Evo 3D with ICS. Needs another update, fix immediately. I doubt that the app will work for anyone that updates it them self.
__label__1 Add me: CeltonasReally funny, love it! I like talking to my heroin...I guess I'm just an encourager at heart. But pretty soon I'm going to start messing with her...just to see what she's made of.
__label__0 so this is the only app I downloaded this week, and now my phone has a virus.  I can only assume its this program that did it
__label__1 Been playing for three months now and this game still rocks my world,  a week after I  joined my wife had to sign up too and we can't get enough.Simple, continuous game play.  As you increase levels you will unlock the ability to duel other heroes, get a
__label__1 The only reason I'm rating this, is because of all the ignorant comments by religious idiots. This game could be referring to the thousands of &quot;gods&quot; invented before Christianity came along and decided to steal the history and story-line of the
__label__1 I get the feeling this may be a battery drain, but it's great for a laugh and you can't help but want to check up on your silly hero.
__label__1 Zero player game. Watch your hero complete quests and help them... Sometimes... Lol. Brilliant design and completely addictive and requires no supervision. Don't understand what I mean? Try it! Seriously. -phrontisteries (add me)
__label__1 its so fun!!!! i luv making words into sentrnces...wutever tht meens. its so funny but at times its confusing!!!one question...IS IT REALLY LIKE THT UP THERE??? ITS SO COOL.
__label__1 a great game to check on occassonaly. passive fun like an ant farm. not high octane. clever and witty. :)
__label__1 I don't know what's better the &quot;game&quot; or the Jesus freaks at the bottom who gave 1* because your &quot;playing god&quot;  get a life, its a game.
__label__1 everyone should play this game it is so fun and very addicting all of you should put your God name here mines Karichan, add me
__label__0 I'll admit, I chuckled at one of the puns...but this app is (was) a complete waste of time &amp; memory on my phone.
__label__1 This app is great especially if you're familiar with RPGs. Definitely satirical and filled with play on words. Great great fun!
__label__1 I can't stop looking at my hero just to see what crazy things he does next...though most of the time it's drinking. Great game for those who want the flavor of an MMO without dedicated hours of staring at at screen.
__label__1 I have been playing this game for months now and I still love it. keep in mind, this is not an instant gratification game. It's a check in a couple of times a day game.
__label__1 Loving this - keeps me laughing all day. Very witty and addictive! And the forum is great fun, too!Goddess name: Bellatrixie (or Bellatrixie The Strange, as soon as the admins get around to changing it for me)
__label__1 I enjoy the witty comments and scenarios that your hero gets themselves into. The only think I would add is a way to make your hero smarter but I'm worried about what would happen if they used any magic.
__label__1 I enjoy the humor and references the game has. I love that you can be as committed as you want and it just plays by itself.
__label__1 This game has no true game play, no real action, and no true storyline, and as far as I'm concerned, I should be hating this.  But it's AWESOME!  It's strangely addictive and fun.
__label__1 I've quite enjoyed this game. You take the role of a god, with your own personal hero who travels around his or her world, vanquishing monsters in your name, drinking, and getting killed periodically. You can't directly control them, but that is a good t
__label__1 I have been playing for 9months right now my hero is in a guild called victoriasecrets lombof !!!!! my hero and her pet that now will not die!! are very amusing , if you put this  game down for a month your hero keeps going on with their lives and quest,
__label__1 I never have time to really get into a game any more, but this game allows me to just guide (in some small ways) a little, then sit back and watch it unfold without missing too much inbetween checking on it
__label__1 It's different but highly addictive.... Im glad that I don't have to do much to play. its a keeper.. add me my godname is sheisme33..
__label__1 I've had this installed for months now, and despite the minimal interaction, it is one of the few games I won't uninstall to make space for another.Let your hero loose and watch her praise you and smite your enemies.
__label__1 Great if you don't have much time on your hands and enjoy a quick laugh. But why is my character such a wimp?!
__label__1 this is just genius... i mean i cant always check in on my hero everyday so this is just AMAZING. the only thing is i wish you could read what your hero did over the days or whatever time period. but other than that... GENIUS
__label__1 I've had this game for over a month now. You don't really play it. It plays you. I check in on my hero a couple times a day. All the functions work well on my Kindle Fire, and it is oddly addicting. I find it funny and well thought out. The devs did a gr
__label__0 This is by far one of the most idiotic apps I've downloaded from the Amazon market.  Why people have to make fun of God and show their hate towards Him is beyond me.  After installing the app and looking through it, I removed it the following day.  Dud.
__label__1 Awesome game! Gets you to use your imagination in the reading and so funny. I love my hero's hilarious escapades.
__label__1 Godville has given me loads of chuckles since I installed it a little over a month ago.  I use the android app to monitor my heroine on my Kindle Fire and keep one browser tab always dedicated to Godville when on my computer.I enjoy a hands on approach t
__label__1 This is a really cute little time waster. I like the concept and the pop references. The fact that some Xtians are whining about it is just gravy.
__label__1 Totally worth the download, this is absolutely one of the best free apps on amazon. its hilarious, the updates are always great, having access to the net is required to play, but that's a small inconvenience all things considered. Thanks :)
__label__1 I can't believe people are so anal about a game and religion. Get a sense of humor. ben playing for a day now and think it's great.
__label__1 This is such a fun game to participate in. And so punny! I find myself checking in many times during the day to see what my hero is up to. I just wish he took better care of his pets, damn it!
__label__0 No matter what I do, my hero loses in the arena. There are no instructions and no way to learn how to play. The&quot; funny&quot; dialog is repetitive. I don't like to lose.
__label__1 so much fun. if nothing else get this app for the hilarious quotes. add me, my name is Jc McGodingham
__label__1 great game great time waster works well you can play online in the regular internet as well on your phone I kinda like it maybe you will too
__label__1 So based off the good reviews I decided to download this app. Oh man, I am so happy I did. I fit into so many little niche categories that they make fun of.You will really like this game if:You played World of Warcraft, Parallel Kingdom, Everquest or any
__label__0 There really isn't much more one can say about this app than the title of this review states. The "game", and I use the term lightly, is about on par with watching mold grow on bread. I've been more entertained watching my dog vomit up crayons.
__label__1 Love to check up daily on this game. You can interact as much or as little as you want. Always brings a smile to my face.
__label__1 I have enjoyed this game like others, and, like others, I have been force closing since the update this morning. I hope the devs fix it fast so we can start enjoying it again. My humble warrior might think I've forgotten her.  Motorola Bionic.8/3/12 - Ch
__label__1 I love this game. There is little to do, but the content is usually hilarious. It's a zero play game, so like I said... you don't do much. You basically attempt to guide your hero while it fights monsters and builds you a temple in your name.
__label__1 This silly little game makes me laugh every day.  I find myself randomly checking the app just to see what kind of crazy thing happens next.
__label__1 I really love godville and I think it was a great idea because I basicly don't do any thing. Awesome
__label__1 I have been &quot;playing&quot; Godville for months now and have really enjoyed watching and interacting with my hero. The app is constantly being improved and the execution of the concept is top notch.
__label__1 An RPG you just watch from the sidelines.  Your character does all the hard work with minimal input from you.  It's a text based game of sorts.  You can encourage or punish your character, join different guilds, but mostly you just follow your hero's adv
__label__1 best game i have on my kindle fire. funny jokes, quests, monsters, and gameplay. i would recommend this to anyone. i check my hero everyday. my godname: Andrew mcnatt
__label__1 I love this game!  Its fun, witty, and unique.  It doesnt require daily play, and the adventure continues even when you dont play.  Highly recommend!
__label__1 i got this game on a whim and can't stop playing it. been playing it for 3 solid days since i got it! add me if you need friends. BloodThirsty Brawn
__label__0 So the concept is get a game you don't play and then just read text. Sounds reminiscent of Commadore 64. This is a poor idea, and even poorer app. The ratings do appear to be skewed. Dev appears to be spending time writing reviews. One star and no d/l fo
__label__1 Funny. I'll keep this one and peek at it every so often. The fundamentalists who are offended and rating the app poorly have their underwear on too tight.
__label__1 Fun game with lots of entertaining reading that doesn't require lots of time. Great time killer. I love it. Yay!
__label__1 A game that I just keep going back to. You basically just set it up and let it ride, but it also offers quite a bit of interactive avenues to explore; such as gladiator fighting, guilds, and other casual fun.
__label__1 Very addictive and competitive. Well this is a very stupid and wastes your time kind of app. but AWESOME game and love the references it make to other games. Did i mention it's also hilarious?!?! also you need to be knd of a gameer to understand the joke
__label__0 I seen other reviews for this and they were 5 star reviews well they lied you don't have alot of options for editing unless you buy full version they need to let you know its pretty much a demo. Don't waste you time with this.
__label__0 Test device: Samsung Epic, Android 2.2 officialThe idea here is that this app is supposed to help you fix up the *skin tone* and *faces* in your pictures, giving them a better look.  As a bonus, you get some filters you can apply, to further improve them
__label__0 That is all this app is. It is HORRIBLE! Any kind of "editing" you do looks awful and taints the whole picture. It's blurry and has terrible coloring. You can tell the whole app was designed to advertise Samsung smart cameras. The ads for them are all ov
__label__0 I had all the options to change things than I update it and it's gone, where are the settings? Please fix the issue.
__label__1 This live wallpaper is just beautiful, I LOVE IT!! I have seen alot of live wallpapers, but this has got to be one of the prettiest ones I've seen.
__label__0 i downloaded this app and it would not open  can't really use something i can't open. thank you for nothing
__label__1 Beautiful for my tablet. I am a wallpaper fanatic and I love nature scenes. These are well suited for a tablet and they move. Thanks amazon!
__label__1 I love it. Its girly but very pretty. I don't notice any battery drain. This is my favorite! Very peaceful.
__label__0 I got this app for free but when I downloaded it to my phone it look a lot different than I though.  It looked cheesy and cheap. It is free so....
__label__1 Very beautiful, I don't use it because I found something better, but I really love the anime kinda look. It's worth getting.
__label__1 I only got the free app of this live wallpaper.  It is very pretty.  I would love to see what the paid app shows but I am such a cheap skate.  The colors are very lively and the movement of the clouds are nicely done.  Enjoy!
__label__1 I still have this on my tablet it is so beautiful and tranquil and it is best I seen on my tablet and works both long and tall if I turn tablet either way. I havnt purchased all the other that comes with it and wouldn't recommend anyone spend money to do
__label__1 Haven't had much time to really test the wallpaper but I like what I see so far. I mostly am only writing this to remind people that this is not an app... You can't open it... You just add it like any other wallpaper.
__label__1 Altogether, a lovely live wallpaper - a full and glowing moon (or is that a star?) provides the landscape for a floating ephemera of violet and blue clouds. Ad-free, and works wonderfully on the Kyros!
__label__1 This is very pretty wallpaper.  I like the options you can use with it.  It's kind of like a dream.
__label__1 It was a nice wallpaper while I had it, but I had seen much nicer ones for free else where
__label__1 This is super nice I am sure after i run it for awhile and have no issues I will buy the download.
__label__1 Perfect for me and it looks amazing on my Galaxy S phone. I'll be paying for this one.  Go Dev!
__label__1 This has a soothing affect to me. It's not a busy pattern, nor  is it a fast moving wallpaper that distracts from info that is on screen. I would recommend this to anyone that wants  to beautify their screen. It's awsome-to me.
__label__1 its wallpaper, not an app. thats why it wont open, thats why its not in your app list. its a live wallpaper so you have to enable it. its amazing that some of you dont know how to work your own device, probably because you cant/dont read
__label__1 I like the movement of the clouds. Serene and tranquil. Can't beat free, free, free, free, free, free, free, free!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
__label__0 A waste of money, way to confusing for me. Plus I want to play the person, not a cheat sheet.
__label__1 anyone playing the game should get it.  it keeps you from looking in the dictionary for words to fit the letters you have.
__label__1 I used this when I was just starting out with Scramble.  It was great!  Don't use it very much now but I always recommend newies to use this.
__label__0 Keeps having error notice that it did not download properly. Tried several times..Not a true rating because I have not been able to install it to try...HELP :(
__label__1 this helps me keep up with some of the other people I play with. I like how the page is clear over the board.
__label__1 I really enjoy this game because you can have many games started at one time which you can almost always find someone to play with
__label__1 Sure saves me time playing words with friends.  A quick and easy way to find new words.  I've had poor results copying a puzzle and pasting it on the board help though I've tried the volume down button and on/off button simultaneously.  The instructions 
__label__1 This app is wonderful. It's not just a cheat, it's rather helpful as well. It has a dictionary to help to see if what you came up with is a real word.The board saver is really helpful if you can't come up with a word right then and there. Saving the boar
__label__1 m.patten &amp; Annette Rider said it nicely. I used to play a lot of scrabble in the past. WwF is 'sort of' my return to Scrabble (for free :-)). Before I played words, now I am strategizing and making better placement. The app ia great and deserves its 
__label__1 This is a great cheat app for Words With Friends. it's simple and it tells you how to use it. A must buy app.
__label__1 It helps me when I have very little letters and get stumped on trying to find a word. Great when I had it!
__label__1 Love this app! Every time I have contacted the developer he has responded so quickly it's unbelievable. He is quick to help and to fix the few problems I encountered. App is easy to use and very helpful when playing the game. If you do need help using th
__label__0 I can't get this downloaded to my kindle. Went through process of  getting Adobe file but it sits in my download file and won't allow this app to launch.
__label__1 this app is great, especially when i get stuck with all vowels and one letter, it helps me find words i can use for words with friends without having to pass a turn! I recommend it to everyone, it doesn't get stuck and it is a great help!!
__label__0 I would like to use it split screen, but I haven't found a way to do that. Maybe that will eventually  happen.
__label__1 I like this app better than Word Cheat because you can click on a word to get an instant definition. The only downside I found (maybe I haven't figured it out yet) is you can't a click a beginning or an ending letter, so you can better your search. Other
__label__1 i think this is one of the best help apps on the market,any one who needs a little help should at least give it a try even if they are not big on asking for help. however it is terribly difficult to get to word.
__label__0 When purchased I thought this was a game. Please cancel. A detailed description or a demo screen could prevent the need to cancel soon after placing order.
__label__1 We enjoy playing game and talking with friends when they call to ask where did we come up with that word to win.
__label__1 I love this app, It is an amazing helper for &quot;Words With Friends&quot;! I wish I had this for &quot;Scrabble&quot;:) Thanks Dev!
__label__1 don't write a review if you never used the product. sometimes people need assistance when playing a word. there are beginners out there who are not as good with words or spelling and it provides th assistance needed for them.
__label__1 It is such a help even if it's cheating. Some words I do know but could not see them with the letters jumbled.
__label__1 I downloaded word help for when I got in a bind and couldn't find a word but I am so addicted to using it I use it all the time. Not a good thing because I don't try to find words on my own anymore, but it works better than the online help I was using. S
__label__1 I'm hooked. I must do this every morning when I wake up, and every night before I can go to bed!
__label__1 Yeah yeah I know I'm a cheater but who cares...it's all about the win baby....This app has helped me win a few games but it doesn't guarantee a win.  If you are looking for some help then download it.
__label__1 really comes in handy on word games....all sorts of words to choose from and many various ways to use this tool
__label__1 Now  all ways winning my games. Loving it. It is pretty cool how it can tell u amaZing words. Awesome
__label__1 Excellent ap both for use with WWF as well as with Scrabble.  The overlay capability is pretty good.  Being able to expand the overlay a little more (to see if all the letters of your chosen word will fit) would be even more beneficial, but otherwise, gr
__label__0 there is a free version of this that really doesn't suck. that way youu can be a cheater and a tight wad
__label__0 Impossible to use. Waste of money.  I thought it would be a nice assist but it was no help at all
__label__1 i have never been good with word games. i put in my ideas and if they don't Work this app helps me see what and where i should play. i honestly use it to learn the game and if someone really is that much better then me. i don't care to much for the game 
__label__1 This is any excellent source.  I try not to use this one too often though, because it's cheating you know.
__label__0 Very unfriendly, can see how it is use and can't switch between Word for Friends and Word help easily.  That was a waster..
__label__1 I enjoy playing games and think this is a great help to Words with Friends.  I use it every day.
__label__1 Love it so much.  It unscrambles your letters and offers more word choices. Works great on my Kindle Fire HD reader.
__label__1 I only use it against others that use cheats! You can tell who's using a cheat program or not. I prefer not to use it.
__label__1 I love this app, it helps me so much.  I don't use it to cheat, just to help me find a word.
__label__1 Works great for the occasional stump!For those who don't like it... don't use itStop rating low just because you doing like others using the app. This may be 'cheating' as you see it, but you're just being ignorant and rude
__label__0 This program only worked when it felt like it.  It would not retain words that had been entered & I had to start from scratch more than once on the same game.  Uninstalled it.
__label__1 It works perfectly on my Kindle fire. I love to use it when I'm stuck and need to get rid of those letters that never seem to make a common word!It also supplies you with the definition so you can actually know what that odd word means. It's fun to use a
__label__0 Sorry, but I have not learned to use this game.  I thought it would lend me a hand in Words With Friends, but I haven't been able to figure it out and can't use it.
__label__1 I love this app it helps me so much. My scrabble dictionary is hard to read and I can never find good words.  With this I can easily find words that fit.  Works well in my kindle fire.
__label__1 I find it difficult to use and am still working on itIf its not quick and easy it is not worth it.
__label__1 Love this app.  I play Workds with Friends everyday and use this all the time.  Great app for those who need help.
__label__1 I WAS NEVER ABLE TO BEAT MY SON BEFORE. NOW I BEAT HIM EVERY TIME. YOU COME UP WITH VERY UNUSUAL WORDS.
__label__0 SO FAR, I HAVE BVEEN UNABLE TO USE THIS. DO NOT UNDERSTAND HOW IT WORKS.  I WILL TRY AGAIN IN THE NEAR FUTURE.
__label__1 I truly live this app because when one is playing Words with Friends it sometimes can be difficult to come up with word or when you have a word in mind it isn't playable. this app gives you useful words that can be play with the game, and it has many fea
__label__0 This is for cheaters. I cant see why any decent person would cheat when playing with friends. If you must, than cheat. but don't expect to feel good about yourself.
__label__0 Not easy to use or figure out. Just don't buy into it there is no refund and sorry to say much regret.
__label__1 This app has a lot of features that other apps don't.  You can see your search app over top of the game so you can do searches without switching back and forth between programs.  It never fails to find a word for me.  I love it!!!
__label__1 this app is awesome, its not really a &quot;cheat&quot; but really is help, I'm. a good player with a great vocabulary,  but often find word placement challenging.  this app. helps with that making the game more even when playing with the older, more adv
__label__0 Does not work on my Kindle. Tried to get it to.work.for hours. No luck! The instructions did not help at all.disappointed customer.
__label__1 this is a great tool to have. Not only am I learning words I could never think of on my own I am now able to spell somewhat better and have been able to use them in my normal speach. although some dont know what I am talking about lol.
__label__1 I used to spend hours on one move because I couldn't find a word that fit! that's not the case anymore! works perfectly with the kindle fire!!!
__label__1 Cant even rate this one low!!!! Works great!!! Don't be a hater, try it yourself, you will find it is really useful too!!!
__label__0 I hate this ap! It was a waste of my time and money! It does not work! Don't wast your time!
__label__1 I thought one of my friends was smart until I realized they were cheating, lol! Then I discovered this app and how to use it to win games. I like the in-game feature because it allows you to see the board, the letters you have available and the letters y
__label__1 OMG!!! What a great sample of a book 34 chapters for a sample and who wouldn't want to go buy the book and finish reading it?! But James Patterson is a GREAT author any way, I love pretty much all his books!
__label__1 I play with friends and am glad I can now do this on my kindle fire hd.  I like that I can carry it with me wherever I go.  It is easy and fun to play.
__label__0 Little to none on instructions. No place to inquire. Help is potion much else to say bad bad bad bad
__label__1 What help this app is when playing Words with Friends. I love playing but sometimes get stuck so this helps
__label__0 I can not get this app to work.  I've already wasted too much time trying to figure it out. No matter what I click on I can't get anything to appear nor any help with what or how!!
__label__1 A great app to help with playing Words With Friends.  It gives you many options to play and check your selections.
__label__1 My son tells me it's cheating but I don't mind. I use it on my Kindle Fire HD. I'm pushing 60 so I need a little help now and again. Besides, it's only as good as your tiles. If you have 4 E's, an X, and a W, and there's no tiles left to play, it is what
__label__1 When words with friends is up and working it is a big help. Right now my app is not working on my kindle which is useful,driving me crazy
__label__0 is absolutley not compatible with kindle fire.  works nicely with your. android phone.  you need screen shots and kindle fire does not have that ability
__label__0 I need something that will connect to the game I am playing.Having the option of creating a word from letters available andswitching to another screen is time consuming, frustrating, andnot my ideat of HELP.
__label__0 Did not find the app helpful at all.  Not user friendly, and I especially did not like having to re-create the boards.  The in-game feature did not work.  Complete waste.
__label__1 I have tried this several times, especially yesterday with Words with Friends, I have been looking for something like this for some time.
__label__1 I have really enjoyed playing this game.  It is easy to learn and you can play with several friends at once.  Just be careful who you play with because they may have cheat sheets available.  I didn't like to learn you can download an app that chooses you
__label__1 I've had this app for some time and it woked great.  The hardest part was trying to figure out how to take a screenshot with my Kindle Fire HD 8.9.  Then on Feb 26 Words with Friends pushed out an update changing WWF to landscape mode and WHFF could no l
__label__1 but the first time I clicked on it, it did say .99 cents. first time it ever happened to me in 4-5 months. hit my 'back' button on my phone, tried it again, and it was free! so if it ever happens to you, try again! and wait a good half hour after 12pst! 
__label__1 A little frustrating at times and infuriating but in a good way. Graphics are well done and the puzzles ingenius.
__label__0 It's a generic puzzle game like the thousands that have come before it. Not entirely fun and would not recommend to anyone.
__label__1 I am enjoying this fun little game. Some have had issues with the controls, I don't have a problem with them. This one will make you stop and think!!
__label__0 fun and simple, at first. then the fun starts to turn into repitition, and the simple only a little more than that. yes it may only be a buck, but it really isn't worth it. only recomended for the beginning puzzle solver, and even then you may lose intre
__label__1 I love a good thinking and strategy game, much like Angry Birds. This is a lot like that, except that you are moving boxes as efficiently as possible instead of knocking over buildings. You advance through levels trying to get 3 stars on each, even if yo
__label__1 This game starts out easy and quickly gets difficult. I'm currently stuck on level 10 and am almost to the point of thinking it's not possible... but I know it has to be since there are 100 levels.I've looked online for solutions but can't find them. Any
__label__1 Some people have no patience with waiting until a free app is converted to free.Anyway pretty fun game, barely tried it but going back after this review.Amazon please create an IQ test for people before they can do reviews, just a thought.
__label__1 I love this game. It is a logic puzzler (?)  forces you to plan ahead several steps and avoid trapping yourself. Simple execution but intriguing and challenging. If you like Quell you will like this. I don't have issues with the controls on my evo.
__label__0 like others have said.. we've seen this puzzle a hundred times in different forms... takes 3 seconds to solve in your head... but 30 seconds to actually manoeuvre.worse... can't move to SD.Uninstalled.
__label__1 Would have been well worth the 99&cent; if it weren't free today. I like thinking games like this. Similar to aporkalips.
__label__1 nice game, simple controls, works well on my htc evo. good time waster. can't comment on sound, as I always leave those off. doesn't need a ton of permissions which should make those people who worry happy :)
__label__1 We  have had it for over a year now, illuminating the dark places, and it works great.  Recommend it highly.
__label__1 I chose the five star rating because the ease of download and use for this app is excellent. I keep it charged in preparation of black- outs. It is an excellent tool.
__label__1 I find that I frequently use my phones as flashlights.  With my HTC Thunderbolt, it was preinstalled.  I am using this app for my Amazon FireKindle Fire, Full Color 7" Multi-touch Display, Wi-Fi.  No ads, just a bright white screen that comes in handy ev
__label__1 This app does exactly as descirbed! The app is bright, easy to use, and great for those trips in the dark or small spaces where you can't get a regular flashlight into.
__label__1 This application does what it is supposed to do.Max out the capabilities of the device of illuminating a room. I can't complain even though the kindle fire d does not have a led light the white background and the high brightness level help to illuminate 
__label__0 I could not get it to work at all. So frustrating! After several tries, I had to remove the download.
__label__0 I have tried to load this application and it just won't do it.  I works on my wife's Kindle and gives off good light, but not on mine.
__label__1 Great App! I put this application on my Kindle Fire. No problems and it is brighter than I expected it to be.
__label__1 Was working last week and the sunset while I was up on a mountain and my flashlight was down in the truck. It gave me enough light to walk down the mountain and get to my truck in a pitch black desert night. Thanks!
__label__1 BEST FLASHLIGHT IN THE HOUSE!!!!!!!!! NEVER HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THE STUPID BATTERIES!!!!!!!!! DO WE HAVE BATTERIES, DON'T WE HAVE BATTERIES!!!!!!! WE HAVE HAVE BATTERIES!!!!!!! AND ITS ALWAYS CHARGED!!!!!!!!!! THANKS GUYS!!!!!! LOVE IT!!!!!!!! :~)
__label__1 The idea behind a flashlight application is simply to turn your device's screen bright white, thus rendering a flashlight. This app does only that! Other flashlight apps acess your contacts, gps, and other thongs which are unnecessary. You'd think that f
__label__1 This works very well. After a recent storm produced a power outage, this app was very useful. You can use it to get around at night without waking anyone. Extremely bright.
__label__1 This app works great! Very bright and useful. It can light up a room using the Kindle Fire's screen if you have one. I recommend you getting this app when you are trying to open the backdoor at night:)
__label__1 FlashLight gets 5 Stars from. Many nights sitting outside and playing my Kindle Fire. Its late out no lights on.Shut down my kindle and put my light on and no problems getting around in the dark.Very handy have around.
__label__1 Simply put, this app makes my Kindle Fire screen turn bright white, which is a pretty effective light. To maximize the light, just turn up your screen brightness with the star shaped icon for settings in the upper right corner of the Kindle screen. Works
__label__1 I don't use this app often but it is nice to have available. It is very bright. You can also get fancy and have a banner scroll across, however it is not very useful for that purpose.
__label__1 All I want in a flashlight is for it to make my screen white. That's all this app does. It doesn't require unnecessary permissions, use ads, or do anything else.
__label__1 This app on kindle fire and it is pretty cool. Super bright white light with no extrasplus you can't beat the price of FREE. I really like it.
__label__0 This is my favorite flashlight app on my first generation Kindle Fire--I tried several before settling on this one--and I would give it 5 stars for the 1st gen KF. I like that it's basic, small, no ads, and has no intrusive permissions. It does exactly w
__label__1 Don't buy other flashlights. This is ad free, easy to use, and doesn't ask for info. works great for my Fire, and I tested the difference between this and the home screen, and it's pretty big a difference. Buy it.
__label__1 Hit the app... it comes on nice and bright.  Tap the bottom of the screen to the Home, and it goes off.  Very simple.
__label__0 This didn't work for me. I have a kindle fire and when I opened this app up it just said that the flashlight was stopped. I tried it again and again but it just made my system lag. So I don't know how it will work for you, but for me it was just a waste 
__label__1 This is very helpful. I have used other apps in the past, but this one is the best. It keeps things organized by categories in the store so i am not looking all over the place.
__label__0 I agree with you audiotexas, why in the world would any app need access to your contacts, email, or be able to make phone calls to work on a phone. Even the appstore app for android has access to your contacts, can read your email and sms, and can interc
__label__1 I use this on my computer and on my Kindle Fire and on my Blackberry and I love this app.  You can add anything to a list and create items that aren't part of any list it is an all around awesome app.
__label__1 Makes a great list love it
__label__1 I love this product. I used iin the grocery store and was able to mark off items as I went along. It heallped me from duplicating items. It was awesome. I highly recommend this product.
__label__0 I found this did not have what I was looking for.  It might be alright for someone who likes to shop all over town.
__label__0 I was looking for something to input my pantry on hand items, make my shopping list, and mark the list for coupons.  I guess I was looking for too much, or haven't found the right thing.  I will just keep looking.
__label__0 Don't know whats so complicated about this app but I cant get it to work. Very frustrating when trying to make lists.
__label__0 This wasn't what I expected it to be at all.  I don't know what I was thinking it would be butI ended up deleting it from my kindle.  I can do better with my local grocery store ads.
__label__0 I was so excited when I discovered this app was available for the Kindle Fire!!  What a disappointment after I downloaded it, installed it and started using it!! It does NOT even compare to the version I have on my 1st generation iPod Touch which I loved
__label__1 use this site often and have found it very helpful,,rather than carrying lists around, it is with me easily to read.
__label__1 I have been using this product since it was first  released! Love it. I have recommended it to my family and friends.
__label__0 Got bored fast , more work, think I will still to a piece of paper and a pencil. I would not waste my time unless you are a very patient  person, unlike me.
__label__0 Kindle Fire: does not play any videos (gives an error) or force closes.  I have not seen one video play.
__label__0 I tried itout cause my daughter LOVES Mickey Mouse Clubhouse. The longest so called episode is alittle over a minute.... stupid app not worth downloading. Good thing it was free
__label__0 Whenever I click on a show it just goes to YouTube. It's like if I wanted to watch this on YouTube I would just type it in the url
__label__1 love this app i dont know why people rate it so low i love it but the one thing its missing is a quick go back button
__label__1 IT HAS ALL MY FAVORITE CARTOONS (EVEN FREAKIN KIRBY RIGHT BACK ATCH YA) I CQNT BELIVE THAT IT HAS THIS MANY CARTOONS ITS AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
__label__0 The app didn't run correctly on the Kindle Fire HD. It would take me to a particular category I choose but the videos would not play or if it does it's just black screen.
__label__0 i hate this app they dont have sponge bob showes on here.....that sucks DONT GET ITT!!!! I WILL ALWAYS LOVE SPONGEBOB! LONG LIVE BIKINI BOTTOM! THE STARS DONT GO LOW ENOUGH
__label__1 this is great I love it .it has all my favorite shows from when I was a kid its great for my kindle fire.
__label__1 Your child's own little Tv and remote in which they can watch lots of Tv shows from old to new.  I truly recommend it and just like the product review stated it can be used anywhere!
__label__1 The library is huge. They put alot of effort into getting hundreds of the best cartoons from 90 & 2000s. Its not just for kids either theres plenty of shows for adults too. From clasics like Scooby Doo to new shows like Kim Possible. Once again try this 
__label__1 This app is wonderful.  Whenever I wait in the car for my wife to run into the store, I just know the kids are gonna get restless quickly.  Using this app, I can quickly find a kid-appropriate vid on YouTube, and I can keep them from killing each other w
__label__0 It only gives you a few choices. It seems like the same ones all the time. It stinks free or not.
__label__1 Great app if you have small kids. It compiles all the cartoons from youtube into one browseable app. There are a lot of old cartoons that you can easily watch and reminisce about the old days.
__label__1 dont be upset about an app that says what it does and actually does it.. i dont go to starbucks at all, but that doesnt mean this deserves a low rating. 5 stars for an app that doesnt disappoint
__label__1 app runs well andit makes getting the perks and rewards of using the starbucks card so much easier. great job!
__label__1 I have used this for a while and have not had any problems. It's worth trying. I hope the updates keep coming to keep it working great.
__label__1 I prefer this app over the Starbucks app. Great functionality in a smaller package. Only problems ever have been cause by Starbucks the company, not this dev.
__label__1 Only problem with this being the &quot;Free App of the Day&quot;, is that I don't drink coffee. Ever. However, if I did, I would def use this.
__label__1 My wife and drink our weight in coffee. I have the app on my phone. It makes it real easy to share cards, reload, and find a location. She keeps the real card and I use my phone to pay. You register a card and there you go. Scan your phone. Paid for. Now
__label__1 I swear people don't use that giant thing inside their heads called A BRAIN before leaving reviews on here. So what if you hate the coffee you aren't reviewing the damn starbucks when you leave your 1 star reviews...wish people realize before wasting rev
__label__0 The core function of this app no longer works, at least on a large number of devices. It can't display barcodes. If the developer is aware of this yet continues to sell this app on multiple markets I believe that constitutes fraud.
__label__1 I downloaded this before there was an &quot;official&quot; SB app, and I find myself using this instead of the &quot;real&quot; one.  It updated my card balance automatically where SB I had to do manually.  It just is more user-friendly for reasons other
__label__1 Works flawlessly. Syncs your starbucks card with in seconds of entering data. Has a barcode so that you can let starbucks scan it to pay for your coffee without using your card. I would recommend this if your a gold card holder.
__label__1 since starbucks doesn't feel that Android users are worthy of an official app I use this instead. not having seen the iPhone app, I can't really make any comparisons, but I can say that this is a great app, has everything I need. barcode feature works fl
__label__1 You get points for using your refillable card, resulting in free drinks. These are Starbucks reward points you can accrue. I prefer not carrying yet another card in my wallet, so this app saves my wallet a bit more space.This is great for Starbucks regul
__label__1 easy to use.  seamless.  app helped me remove a thick gift card from my wallet to my phone.  wish i could do this for all of my cards.  great app.
__label__1 Even if Starbucks finally gets their application working, this one does just what I need, fast, and updates my balance automatically when I close the barcode. Nice.
__label__1 Boy, now that Starbucks has released their own app, I had to come back and tel how much better My Coffee Card Pro is!  Much smaller file size.  Thanks Amazon, for making this free a few days ago!
__label__1 I originally had issues with this app after an update, but all is well again and everything has been fixed that I care about.  Transaction history still fails.Works great. I use almost daily for my Starbucks fix and reload directly through the app. Recom
__label__1 (Android user) Handy and well maintained app! Updates regularly and very convenient! Maps, card balance, easy pay barcode feature, very user friendly.
__label__1 Esta aplicaci&oacute;n es la neta planeta. Funciona muy bien y mejor que la aplicaci&oacute;n oficial de starbucks. Hhh hhh hhj jjk
__label__1 This app works awesomely. It provides a great solution to a problem and fills a great need for streamlining the ability to get... coffee!!@the person who complains it doesn't say specifically &quot;Starbucks&quot;: you can't do that.  The easiest way to 
__label__1 exactly what i needed and wanted well presented and executed.  the easiest way to pay for and monitor your rewards
__label__1 This is a must have if you're a Starbucks fan and gold member! I've been using the free version for a while now and it's so fantastic and convenient. Track your balance, purchases, stars, and find locations easily. Plus with pro you can have multiple car
__label__1 app works wonderfully.  I don't even carry my gold card around anymore. I just wish Amazon didn't suck so badly,  the app updated on Android Market 2 days ago. it keeps prompting me for update, but fails since it was an Amazon free app. thank God for roo
__label__0 I hate this game its tilt ctrl sucks there is no other ctrl and the graphics are horrable totaly unuseable! don't get it you will regret it within ten seconds of the game!
__label__0 I usually give games good reviews. however, this is an exception. u cant shoot, aim, and none of the missions make sense. if u don't trust me, go ahead and playthe game. find out for uourself.
__label__0 I should have know better..Its for kids..teenagers i would suspect like it.I tried it once was excited loading but 3 minutes in to the game was bored already..Its like an early 1990's game. Dumped it already
__label__0 stupid, just plain stupid. i thought is would be a good action, but a had a rude awakening. if you want a good sniper game get contract killer.
__label__0 this is total bs i wana know who mad this game and kick him in the face. Contract killer is better than this crap u guys should try it.
__label__0 this app was annoying because the music on it was there wen i exit so yep that is all i have too say byby;(
__label__0 all you do is tap where the enemy is at and shoot them this game isn't realistic at all don't get it waste of time
__label__0 Hi I'm Jazzy and I got this game not listening to the reviews thinking it was cool , I was being clueless this game is horrible you can't even shoot the guys because wen you take out your gun it moves around then gets all scratchy and it's not a good gam
__label__0 I got this app I thought it could be fun and I bought a gun for 130$ in real money so don't ever ever ever get this game :-()
__label__1 This is a great game if you want to mess around or if you want to get better at the actual strategy of blackjack. It lets you keep a count,  see the odds of each option, and tracks your history of betting and winning %
__label__0 this game is flat out boring. not worth the waste of time to download and install. would not recommend at all
__label__0 I could have more fun, as Del Griffith quoted, &quot;playing pick-up sticks with my butt cheeks&quot;, rather than wasting time with this snoozer of an app. CASINO Blackjack? No. More like Blackjack at the kitchen table with Granny. Graphics are small. P
__label__1 Tyvm for this free app!! Have a great Saturday I'll try.Try it It cab be fun if you don't like you can always delete right? :0)
__label__1 this is a good app and it was free. constructive criticism is fine but there's not any reason to dog this game. I'fe been playing it all morning. give it a try. its free today so what can it hurt?
__label__1 play this one everyday  easy to see but i can't figure out how to change the betting amount to a lower amount
__label__0 this program does not  need your identity to operate.  Careful what info these intrusive programs need.  I would like to hear from the developer as to what they plan to do with, my information.
__label__1 this is one of the best blackjack games i have ever played and all you need to do is pay attention to your next move
__label__0 I decided to review this app now instead of waiting at 3:15 am, but glad I did, this APP SUCKKS! I placed a bet with my kindle fire and lost against friends. I'm reviewing on my new kindle fire, 1 star for being the free app of the day! :D
__label__0 Hello fellow amazonians from another day at the hospital. I was board from watching my roommate picking his puss from a freshly amputated thumb that he had because of a recent hitchhiking accident. so I downloaded the faotd to entertain myself with a few
__label__0 FYI: data mining &quot;read phone state &amp; identity&quot; not necessary for a card game app. uninstall. . . .  . .
__label__0 I increased my bet and it worked fine. Then I decreased my bet. When you go to increase it again, it doesn't work. Doesn't matter if you hit decrease or increase, it's stuck on decrease.
__label__0 can not download as it wants me to enter credit card info. before downloading ... it is a FREE app why does it need this info.??? not sure why I am the only one with this problem but I refuse to give a game this information .... so unless they fix this m
__label__1 Teaches you the correct move by showing expected value of hit, stay, double down, and split. Also shows customizable count and allows for many settings changes.
__label__0 False advertising by Amazon if they have a permission section and omit things. Why bother with a permission section at all if its incomplete. Whats next, a whole bunch of permissions worthless without net access, then you download and see the net access 
__label__1 This is not poker, as some of the reviewers have failed to observe, and it is a well-done game, at that.The permissions are obvious, for the informed: the SD access is so that it can store game save information; the phone state permission is probably so 
__label__0 Before I can rate an app for the experience itself, I always look to see what's going on behind the bells and whistles before downloading and installing.  Heck, most people do that (or at least should) on their computers as well.  Usually, you can count 
__label__1 It is not pretty, but the game is so well designed, and so quick that it completely makes up for looks Imo. Since it is so quick I get sucked in and lose all my game money in no time at all!
__label__0 Not worth the memory space and has very unrealistic play. I'm a hardcore blackjack player and all this app does is teach people who don't know Blackjack how to screw themselves and others at their table by trying to count cards instead of learning the lo
__label__1 This is a good app.  I can increase and decrease my bets with no problem.  It works just fine on my nexus.  Would like sound, but other than that, interesting app.
__label__0 I couldn't get betting to work.  Well, it did show displays but my "bankroll" or my purse as others would call it never changed...  so perhaps I didn't understand how this feature was supposed to work.  I figured if you placed a bet you would either win 
__label__0 I have another Blackjack app I prefer.  I can't remember even playing this one.  This may have been during the time the Amazon App locked up my etablet with the Angry Bird Season with Ads.  So I don't think I've every successfully downloaded this one.
__label__1 Awesome game! Intalled on transformer and Droid 2. Works great on both. No problems changing bet. Stupid dog woke me up- first to review! Very windy today. Sounds like house may blow away to Oz!
__label__1 Great way to keep math skills sharp and waste time. Fun to play when there isn't anything better to do. Same rules as a casino.
__label__1 Fun to play. Will teach how to play blackjack from a beginner to an expert. Definitely worth the price.Contains no adware or analytics, works firewalled, adblocked and with data/wifi disabled.
__label__1 Nice app and works as advertised.  worth the free dl if you enjoy playing BlackjackTo the idiot one star reviews GET A LIFE ALREADY and give up the FAOTDGo out and spend your Mommy's money on apps that will satisfy yoururge to purgeThanks AAzon for the F
__label__1 After a recent trip to a casino in Louisiana, I came home with the 'fever', this was the perfect cure and it doesn't cost me a dime! Love it. Just wish I could find something similar for Roulette!
__label__0 After playing for just an hour, I could predict what card (or at least card value) would come up next in my hand. For instance, whenever you have an ace and a number card, and you hit on it, you will ALWAYS get a card with a value of ten do you end up wi
__label__1 I don't often do reviews for apps unless I am thoroughly impressed or distressed. That said I am writing this review because you probably saw the photos of this game and weren't impressed. I too was about to move on but since it's the free app of the day
__label__0 the real black jack app is on here for free and is better in my opinion. on the other market it has 250,000 reviews this on like 90 reviews
__label__1 I watch this game all the time on tv, and was really excited to see it offered as the FAoTD. However, I can't get the dealer to let me see a flop, much less the turn or river. I have tried reinstalling, but still no fix. Please update! I want to be the n
__label__1 I watch a lot of tv so I know a thing or two about poker. like once you flop down by the river and poker you get a full house.
__label__1 Practice BJ strategy! How this game has only 3 stars-confuses me. this strategy game is intense! practice your best vegas game
__label__0 cannot find any stations somehow, and only says, &quot;error&quot; on my kindle fire. But, the creator did say it would not play the station, but could be better.
__label__0 This app only finds local stations near you and it still didn't list all the radio stations near you. So there for this app wasn't worth downloading it. I downloaded it for a trip I took since I was going to be traveling through different States. I reall
__label__1 It found all the stations in my area in a flash. I would recommend this app to anyone needing to find particular stations with your favorite genre of music.
__label__1 This is not a FM radio player. If finds local radio stations you can play on your fm radio. Great app if you travel. People who don't read the description think it will play them, it does not. Don't get mad because you did not read.
__label__0 I cant believe this app! Ya it helps you find radio stations, but how many of u that r looking at this app right now r looking for something that actually plays music? this app is so stupid because it only finds radio stations but, doesn't even play them
__label__1 This seems pretty cool. I am planning a trip and have always hated losing my station and then searching for another one. I tried it out at home and it found all the radio stations in the area. I wasn't looking for something to play the station and this d
__label__1 the desk clock works great. I am glad that it is free. definatly worth it. I use it every day. helps a lot.
__label__1 This is a nice clock. It is accurate and does what you want a clock to do. No complaints here.
__label__1 Perfect simple clock. I use this nonstop with my older phone on my baby's nightstand. It plays the music and then I just display the clock all night. Perfect perfect.
__label__1 Nice calculator with all the basic funcionaliy. Looks great on my 7 inch tablet! Recommended for those seeking a solid calculator.
__label__0 Your stuff Is stupid just to see if it will work I put 1x1.  And u people said it equals 2255'777..22 whatever ur stupid stuff Is getting on my nerves ughhh noobs
__label__1 Looks and works better than the default Android app ! Has M+ and etcetera. Nice keyboard layout and color scheme.
__label__1 no no no noi no no no no no i dont do these period so dont ask please ok .
__label__1 This simple calculator is perfect for your basic needs and it is one of the few that doesn't ask permission to things I think are unnecessary for a calculator. I highly recommend this calculator.
__label__1 Added to kindle fire hd. Very big numbers and east to use Not fancy. Just a plain calculator for balancing usage
__label__1 It works weel on my sister's Kindle and she seems to like it enough to keep it there, so I can't complain.
__label__1 I use this app to add bills works really well no &#34;problems&#34; here . I use it frequently and I haven't had any glitches and no freezing other.
__label__1 I love this app.  I does everything I need it to do & more.  Great idea!  I highly recommend this this product.
__label__1 This application was free for my Kindle fire.  It is easy to use.  I showed my doctor who wanted to know where I got it.  You can export the results in many different file types( xls, doc,....) and e-mail it to your doctor before check ups. I love this a
__label__1 this is a clean, simple and efficient app. does exactly what i need it to do: track blood sugar, weight and blood pressure. i love the ability to set reminders. good product.
__label__1 Easy to enter data and it provides an easy to understand summary of the information. The defaults make it simple and quick to use.  I especially like the export feature which allows me to easily create an excel file to send my cardiologist. Works well on
__label__1 Great Deals
__label__1 I have to say I thought some of their stuff I thought it was expensive until their sales come up. Great buys, some out of seasons but that's the way I shop.
__label__1 If they delivered any faster, my package would hit the front door before I put in the order.  The post office dosen't even carry a letter across town as fast.
__label__1 I am a shopaholic and I love Zappos. They have so many great shoes so of course I love the app.
__label__1 I have been with Zappos for 8+ years, and this app makes shopping so easy.  I can easily browse while laying in bed, and so much easier to see on the big screen.
__label__1 It's a fun site to look at, but I haven't ordered from there in the years since they were hacked.
__label__1 I love Zappos, now I have them with me in more ways than one.  A great company to do business with and there aren't others like Zappos.
__label__1 I think this is the best shopping app yet....hope that greater things will build off of this and greater things will happen an  more people will download  it but that's just me....hope they come out with a more upgraded one..I would jump on that in a hea
__label__0 I got a message telling me that the app was corrupted and would not load on my Kindle.  I didn't attempt to try loading it a second time.
__label__1 ive been a zappos fan and member for years, they are constantly improving and already stellar customer service. and company as a whole. love zappos!
__label__1 I wear a size 4.5 in ladies shoes and cannot buy shoes in a store any longer.  Stores rarely carry shoes below size 6, so those of us with smaller feet have to buy shoes on line.  Zappos is one of the best places to do that.  The shoes are not cheap, but
__label__1 I have been shopping Zappos for quite a few years.  I have &#34;never&#34; had a problem with the product or service.If i send an email about an issue or just a question they are always right back with an answer within a day.I go nowhere else for my shoe
__label__1 I love to shop Zappos.com because it has a great selection of shoes and FREE shipping both ways. I also like shopping for shoes without a sales person. It's super simple to shop Zappos.
__label__1 Zappos has a great thing going for it and I love that I can buy through Amazon now too. You can spend an entire day on their website or search for immediate location of a product.
__label__1 I wear a size 15 shoe, so I'm pretty much limited to online purchasing. Love Zappos and this app. Super easy to shop.
__label__1 This is one of the best .com service that I have used. It it very thorough and covers in detail all of Zappos departments
__label__1 It is really nice to see an app done right. This app covers the shopping function, order placement, fulfilment and order tracking.  all with an easay to use user interface.
__label__1 Zappos makes shopping from home a real pleasure. They have great website and you get lots views of the shoes you are interested in to help you narrow down your choices. shoes arrive quickly with no shipping charge and you can take your time decididng if 
__label__0 Don't waste your time with this.  I only have a kindle and looking at the website without this app is much better.  There are limited graphics and options with it.
__label__1 Always have the product the next business day, free returns for 365 days after purchase, no questions asked.  Always friendly service.
__label__1 Love Zappos, free shipping, no hazzles, arrives shortly after you order it depending on where you live.  If it comes from NYC to PA we get it overnight and you ship it back free and replacements are sent w/o you paying any shipping.  Love the free shippi
__label__1 There are few companies in America that I can look upon and say &#34;I really enjoy doing business with these people&#34;. Zappos is one of them. Selection is unparalleled. Service is second to none, in both shipping and customer service should something
__label__1 I love Zappos and this little app gives you easy access to all of Zappos' features with full access to your Zappos account.
__label__1 Apples wonderful for all shoe lovers. Shoe people will love this free Kindle app. All shoes for any kind of woman.
__label__1 I am going to spend more time shopping with this app. I can track my free one day delivery any where!
__label__1 The products are of great quality. No hassel display is easily layer out Ionosphere's that I will be gettingmy monies worth.

__label__1 It's easy, it's affordable,and the delivery is even better. I have slot of my family and friends shopping from the app..Everyone loves it
__label__0 I'm sorry to Zappos for this review. I don't want to buy shoes from my phone. Ever. This app was automatically installed on my phone (Motorola DROID RAZR MAXX HD 4G Android Phone (Verizon Wireless)when it automatically updated to the Jelly Bean software 
__label__1 I ordered on line and then I needed to change the order and called the customer service number and the person I talked to was so helpful.  She made the changes and was very quick and helpful.  Then Monday afternoon I had the order!  It was great.  Thanks
__label__1 My sister first introduced me to Zappos and it's been great.  I've purchased shoes and sneakers that are both comfortable and stylish. Excellent service and fast delivery makes Zappos one of a kind and top of the line in my book.
__label__1 This app is very easy to use and even fun! It's very user friendly. I can look up just a particular brand or style, or everything relating to one item. There are lots of great things to buy, whether it be for kids or grandparents! Great great app! And it
__label__1 Loving my Keen's.  Getting lots of compliments.  Everyone want to know where I got them.  Of course i say ZAPPOS!
__label__1 Zappos is above and beyond FAST when it comes to shipping.  Customer service is amazing.  They set the standard for other companies in problem solving, i.e., doesn't fit, color doesn't match the dress, etc.  Returns are handled expediently.  They are SO 
__label__1 I love this app. I use it all the time. Works great. It makes it easy to find any the you're looking for.
__label__1 This app is great for navigating and Zappos did a great job improving the customer shopping experience from the tablet perspective. I strongly recommend this app if you even just casually browse the Zappos website.

__label__1 Extremely helpful in placing order.  More than willing to work our unique situation.  Service is outstanding and Michelle and Regina were  awesome.
__label__1 So far this app is easy to use and easy to navigate.  It moves from screen to screen very well without freezing, and I can make the images larger if I want to, which is something I wish more Kindle apps would do.  So far my experience is a pleasant one.
__label__1 I can find so much s stuff on her that I want!  Good prices and a very wide selection!  Highly recommend
__label__1 The prices on this site can NOT be beat!!! They have literally EVERYTHING you are looking for. Shoes, handbags, jeans, and everything else.
__label__1 This is a great place to shop they are great to deal with. I ordered a pair of shoes and realized that I ordered the wrong size I picked up the phone and called OMG they were great had the order and changed it and then I received my  shoes the next day. 
__label__0 No worth my time downloading this app. Zappos is a let down so I'm removing the app from my Kindle.
__label__1 Awesome app. Use it all the time. So easy to navigate. Never had any issues ordering when using this app. Just great.
__label__1 Zappos has the best customer service department in the world when it comes to buying shoes. Free shipping in and out... They are quick and treat customers like VIPs...
__label__1 If you like Zappos, you'll love this app. Easy to search for specific items or just randomly look around.  Easy use. Get down on it!
__label__1 zappos is like magic.  They will get your product to you the very next day (I live in California...mostly... but have had it happen in Michigan too)  I honestly don't know how they do it.  And shipping is free.The hardest thing for me is shopping on thei
__label__1 I have shopped on Zappos for shoes for a couple of years now and have to say, I love it! I have also bought gift cards for my son who is hard to buy for so that makes it easier. Everything I have bought from them is high quality and I get the package a d
__label__1 I am excited for summer to arrive so that I can finally wear these adorable, flirty sandals! They make my feet look smaller too!
__label__1 Great website for clothes.  I will definitely order something from t his website. I also told my sister about it.
__label__1 For years I have had trouble finding shoes because I have a VERY narrow foot.  I am amazed at the selection of shoes in my size.  I will be a customer for life!
__label__1 What a great place to buy shoes..  There is usually a short video showing how the shoe looks on your foot which is very helpful to us women.  The shipping is free and the return is also free so you have nothing to lose and everything to gain by trying th
__label__1 if you are a shoe lover.. then take the pleasure of using zappios the web site is fanastatic yoy never go wrong everyone should have thus APP
__label__1 Seems to be a well made pair of shoes, would buy again.Have to see if they stands the test of time... :-)
__label__1 Zappos website alone is very efficient and easy to use so this app works perfectly. My only drawback is the scrolling but I just hate touchscreen but it's easy and fun to use  Zappos May be expensive but they are always worth the money
__label__1 I have recently ordered several items from Zappos and have been extremely satisfied with the quality of the products ordered, the prompt attention, and fast shipping of my orders.  One item which I ordered was in the wrong size and I was able to promptly
__label__1 I've shopped with Zappos and find they have good merchandise. They are very good with customer satisfaction.If unhappy with a purchase you can return it .Also, they deliver fast; in two days you can receive your product.
__label__1 Great, easy and convenient website.  Easy to navigate with a large number of products in many different areas...split into catagories for quick searches.
__label__1 Great site for many products great shipping and handling and return features. So many cool things in one place Zappos.
__label__1 Zappos has everything I want especially when it comes to shoes. This app just makes it easier and more accessible!
__label__1 I love this website. You get free shipping and free returns. There are tons of things to buy here from shoes to clothes to beauty and beyond. I've ordered from them several times with a great experience each time. Sometimes I've found cheaper prices too.
__label__0 Rather use the website than the app. Didn't care for the app at all. Love zappos tho! I use their website instead.
__label__1 I think this is one of the best websites there is for ease and amount of merchandise to purchase.  I don't mind paying a little more to get my purchases overnight.
__label__1 It's very easy to browse shoes on my kindle.  I've never had any problem with this app and I really love it.
__label__1 No problems with this app. Working perfectly on my Android. I get all my updates here and can purchase items quickly. A
__label__1 Original Review: Locks up and freezes Kindle FireI read the reviews where people wrote that it "crashes the kindle".  To me a crash is when the app exits to the main screen, and what I experienced was a lock. My kindle was completely frozen.  The only wa
__label__1 Very long lasting and has good quality and a high instep..Sizes are confusing .. Mens  and womens are combined to be a little off.
__label__1 They look so great I am going to order two more pairs!  Get your season favorite glasses.  I know I am!!
__label__1 I love shopping at Zappos for all my shoe needs. They are far easier to deal with than a local store. The reviews help make decisions before purchasing. I've been ordering for over 10 years and never had an unhappy moment. I order 8N and rarely have to r
__label__1 This app really understands how to present the data on the small screens of mobile devices. It's easy to use and makes shopping convenient.
__label__1 I loved the app but did not use itmuch on my Kindle. What may work for some doesnot always work for others.Thanks Anyway Amazon!
__label__1 I got this for my mother since she is always asking how much of a tip she should leave.  She loves it!  She is not a person who uses electronic things (cell phones, computers, tablets...), but she will play certain games and she will use this app.
__label__1 This app is quick to download and install. It lets you adjust the number of persons paying the bill. It also allows you to adjust the tip percentage.
__label__1 I used this only last night when out to dinner with friends.  It is an easy to use, helpful tool.
__label__1 I have been using this tip calculator for over 3 years! Best one on the market and its free. The only thing I want is a widget!
__label__1 I installed a few different apps like this and continued to be frustrated by all the extra &quot;features&quot; on other apps.  This is the perfect, simple calculator and gives you all the info you really need without overusing your disk space.
__label__0 Just tells you about titles Netflix gets, not when they're available for streaming. Since Netflix's DVD service is being renamed, the app should be redesigned around streaming (the only part that will still be called Netflix.)
__label__1 great app for my kindle when I want t watch it in the bathroom otherwise can not complain you may want to try it
__label__0 I uninstalled this the second day I got it. It gave me a few movies I'd never heard of. not worth the space it took up on my kindle.
__label__1 I impressed all of my friends with this one that is only a small picture compared to some of them. This app is super fun and super coooool!(\____/)(=^.^=)(&quot;)___(&quot;) BUNNY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!/\_/\  _/  ' '  \  / )n n.  _____  ( (=(Y =.&quot
__label__1 It's so cute, I don't use it a lot but it still is the cutest and there must be hundreds of these cute emote icons and stuff nice app, thumbs up :)
__label__1 I sent my dad a message on his phone and he loved it!!!!! I like this because my mom and dad love it to!
__label__1 Very nice cute app. It gave me a bunch of different little things to text to people. And they have many different themes and stuff. Love it.
__label__0 awful, don't waste your time or device storage. The descriptions are bad and the execution is worse. You can find better just by searching the net.
__label__1 Had this for a long time, works perfect!... and you can either make your own text picture and save, or change one thats already there and save.. Simply copy and paste, it goes anywhere with you all day long till you paste.. For all your "must haves" need
__label__0 I was on this very pageto write a goodreview for this when my keyboard froze up, then completely dissapeared. Then my fire crashed and I had to restart. so I think &quot;maybe somethings wrong with this app&quot; because I had JUST downloaded it. so I tr
__label__0 there are maybe 2 or 3 decent &quot;images&quot; but the rest is horrible scrambled crap that you wouldn't even recognize without the title description.
__label__1 I really like it it is good for all sites :) I would recommend this app to anyone who has facebook, loves to text/email, or is on a social Internet site often.
__label__1 This app is good for what it is. It's just a short catalog of some Ascii Art. That's all. Not bad, not great, but it's free, and you can learn how to make the silly bunny rabbit  :)
__label__1 anyways if u have a kindle fire u should totally get it but only if u have txt + because then u could press the 1 u like and then it will give u options and then press send then u can send it to ur friends it is so awesome I would recommend it! !!!!!!!!!
__label__1 idk if its a copyright app or something but it just wont let you copy and pasteanything but otherwise ilove looking at the pictures once or twice a day.
__label__1 Even though they are copied from the Net, these are probably the best emoticons.ever. in my life. yes, they ar-okay you get the point...! :c)
__label__1 (kawaii=cute)  this app is amazing I love the stuff you can send.  I don't have a txting app but they're. pretty easy to copy so this is super fun!
__label__1 good and free.  thanks.  and to the idiotic moron before me that gave this guy a 1 star, get a clue &amp; a life, loser.
__label__1 This is soooooo awesome cause the symbols  looks like animals and people!!!!!!! It's soooooo awesomeI DONT WHAT TO SAY!!!! :D
__label__1 awesome, my friends keep thinking the bunny and things where different types of plants or animals... there kinda crazy lol
__label__1 It wouldn't download but still,I learned a lot from the bunny!!!!!!!!!AWESOME APP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I rlly impressed my freinds with the bunny,and alot of other Ppl!!!!!!!A+ App!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
__label__1 have been texting for only a few months so many of the characters make no sense - without help. this is it. the creations are fun and give me a reference when i encounter someone's  cryptic msgs. U knw.
__label__1 My 12 year old daughter got this for her Kindle. She uses it when texting friends and gets a big kick out of it! She says all her friends ask her how she makes all those amazing pictures. She really likes it and has fun finding just the right picture to 
__label__0 I have never removed an app faster. This app was slapped together with as little time as possible. The &quot;art&quot; is copied from the Internet and each is given a generic name like &quot;Littleone13&quot; I stead of what the emoticon is trying to exp

__label__1 This is such a fun app. I got it free so price wasn't a problem but the samples weren't to bad and you could even use your own photos!!! I highly recommend this for anyone (mostly kids but whatever). It's the best and coolest app ever!!!! As my friends w
__label__0 this game s-u-c-k-s that spells sucks.if I were u I would not get but that's just me. do not get this game!!!!!!!
__label__0 I searched on the app store HUNDREDS of times and I am YET to find a free version!!!! all the app companies want is money to keep making apps. I understand! but u should have a free app too!
__label__0 The effects are slow on my device, the back button just exits the application without any question if I want to save, the take picture crashes the app. Not worth the buy!!
__label__0 could the price go to free cause kindle fires don't even have cam's to take pica of people and mess with them as April fools :c no fair
__label__0 don't waste your money. I got it for my kindle and it dosent have stickers like the ipod version, plus kindles don't have cameras to take pictures so you have to use the default pictures.
__label__1 I LOVE THAT YOU CAN MESS PEOPLES FACE UP. IT MAKES IT FUN THAT YOU CAN ADD STICKERS. FUN GAME
__label__0 Despite the fact that I am connected via wifi, this app opens up and tells me that it cannot connect to the Amazon appstore, and then advises me to check my network connection.It then closes and restarts my tablet.This has happened 4 times in a row, and,
__label__1 This app will keep my very rambunctious 4 year old busy for a while, and that's saying something.  We love the gallery of pictures that are already available and being able to input your own pictures is quite entertaining as well.
__label__0 I didn't have any issues uploading photos, opening the app or using. But it is incredible boring. You can either poke it and make it jiggle. Ooo-ahhh. Or warp the picture a little. Don't waste your $money$. Unless you want to I guess. Its up to you.
__label__0 I am warning everyone here - DO NOT PURCHASE THIS APP UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES.This app is utterly useless and and a scam. You can use Gimp to do this and other free things on the Internet. This app just wants money.
__label__1 It's so simple, and yet, my boys 7 & 4 can't get enough of this game! We've only owned it for a few days! They love it!
__label__0 Not worth the free price.  Will delete app. The so called free Cosmopolitan magazine promo does not work.  Absolutely terrible.
__label__1 I love free apps, but this one is great, You always find something new here. It's super!! You gotta try it
__label__1 I have received quite a few freebies from this site!I would defiantly recommend it to anyone who likes free stuff.
__label__1 this app is a good deal. they have a lot that work right from my kindle fire. so far I have gotten a free year subscription to Martha Stewart and Rachel ray magazines and some food samples. I do recommend this. the magazines a lone are worth it.
__label__0 The app is set up beautifully, but it is not user friendly. It had several options to click into, but I would receive either a note saying I need to upgrade to use that feature or it was a link to an advertisement. Lots of advertisements on this app! I b
__label__1 I have been using it for a few years now, it's always near accurate predicting my cycle, and it was handy when I had my children.
__label__1 It works for me I'm thirteen and I just got my first menstrual cycle and I wanted to be a blew to track my flow and I think it works great! I advise you to download it, it works very well for me and it should behold for you too!
__label__1 I chose this after a bunch of others I tried.  I've used it for 6 months and this has a cute layout and really easy to plug in information.
__label__1 This such a wonderful little app. Definitely worth the download. It predicts better than any other all of its kind that I've had before! I'm even tempted to pay for the pro version!!!! Totally recommended to every woman!!
__label__1 I'm so busy, I rarely remember to keep track of my cycle.  This app works great.  After a few months, it figured out my monthly cycle and I'm by no means regular.  It also has a calendar to remind you of whatever else you need reminding of.  Great little
__label__1 This has helped me so much since I've gotten it. I am able to keep track of not only my cycle, but I can also add notes that can help me keep track of when my other health problems flare up. My doctors have always asked if my pain gets worse around the s

__label__1 they have thought of everything in this app. so helpful in predicting the unpredictable at times. if u want to time conception this app is wonderful for that too
__label__1 I went off the pill a few months ago, and my husband and I are trying for #2. I never knew when my period would come because I was always on the pill (10+ years) and my pill pack always told me when it was due. After a few months using this app, it figur
__label__1 This app is very useful I also like the comments in the app it answers questions that I have so I recommend this app if you don't want to be spending $2.99 on pro or want something simple
__label__1 Really, every girl/woman needs this app. It is always convenient to track your period, but to track your moods, symptoms, and intimate moments is just SO helpful. I LOVE THIS APP.
__label__1 Extremely accurate and great app to use for teens and women who have their period. Highly recommend Pink-Pad! Looking to get the paid version also!!!
__label__0 It would not accept any user name. It gave me an error notice each time, saying I couldn't use certain names, and only letters, numbers, and punctuation. It wouldn't even accept &quot;Jane Smith&quot; as a username.It's ridiculous to require users to jum
__label__1 I could never remember when I started myperiod in my own head. With this app I don't have to remember. It's very dandy that you can put emotions and your thoughts in it too. Very good Job! Keep up the good work!
__label__1 Pink is my favorite color so how could I pass this up??? Pretty good stuff right here :-D Good thing it's free.
__label__0 it worked and amazed me for 1 single day it was so **** stupid do not get this app trust me u r waisting your time

__label__1 This is so great! REALLY helps when you have a problem remembering dates! Good idea and pretty darn accurate!!!!!!!!!! AWESOME!!!!!! LOVE IT, LOVE IT, LOVE IT!!!!!!
__label__1 I love this app. It's really accurate and super easy to use. And it's useful. At first it's not as accurate because it dosent have much data to go on. But as you log your period it gets super accurate. I defiantly recommend this app.
__label__1 I've tried other apps out there for tracking your period and knowing when you're fertile days are... none are as sleek and simple to use as this one. Also enjoy the forums of other members where you can interact if you want to.
__label__1 Super helpful. it enables you to track almost every aspect of your cycle. It even shows you when you are ovulating! Great help for me I used to do this on a calendar by hand. So glad I discovered this.
__label__1 with this app, I don't have to worry about my period surprising me in school on the one day I wear white jeans. it takes one thing off my mind and makes life that much easier. I love that you can also track moods and temps and weights on it too. the foru
__label__1 I got this app for my kindle fire and its absolutely wonderful. I no longer have to guess when my period is and all the symptoms help as well. I'm upgrading to the paid version.
__label__1 This app is deffinately worth it. For somebody like me, who has trouble keeping up with when my period is, this is a life saver. It also helps me record symptoms on different days and different occasions. More to it: the app has a weight and temperature 
__label__1 This app really helps you track everything with your body.  I could never tell before and now I somewhat have an idea.
__label__1 This is neat little app. It's simple, easy to use and understand. It is upgradeable if you want extra 'stuff'. I haven not needed to upgrade mine. I believe it to be very useful and accurate so far!
__label__0 I hate this app because there's no worth on playing it's so boring I can't do anything with it all I can do is place dates on the stupid calender. Says Fantasia
__label__1 This program is excellent! It has helped me keep track of my cycle and other things. So useful when you need to know and can't remember because you not only have the calendar and dates you have notes you need too. Helped me so much I was able to get a su

__label__1 I am loving this app so far. I couldn't wait to get my period, so I could put it in here. Remember the days in your checkbook register, when you would start each period with a circle and x out the rest? Those days are gone! I have also been looking for a
__label__1 this app is amazingly awesome and on target I love it. it is the best period tracked app ever!!!!!' great app

__label__1 I like the way this app can be customized, so it is not a one size fits all. It has different uses depending  on what you want to use it for. It is user friendly.
__label__1 For a free app it's pretty awesome! I just started to use it. I'm tempted to buy the full version but I want to give the free version a go for a while to see if I really like it enough to pay for it! I like the graph charts and its easy to use!! It's the

__label__1 Great way to keep track of periods...intimate moments...and how you are feeling...really helpful to know the best time to try for baby and when your next periods coming
__label__1 The Pink Pad (Period Tracker)  is just the app I needed to help ne keep track of that time of the month.  It's. great for those doctor visits when you need to give info on your period schedule,  flow,  symptoms.  Its all there great for all beginners or 
__label__1 Downloaded this 3 years ago now (have since upgraded to the paid version) I love it! I have been with my husband for three years and have used this to track my cycle and avoid getting pregnant. I do not believe in birth control and condoms are so incredi
__label__1 It is great! Exactly what I was looking for! Just enter the date of your last period and everything else is done for you. If you want to keep up with your symptoms and moods, body temp or weight you can enter it all in the calendar. Precise and easy!
__label__1 This is the free version with ads on the bottom. Felt I had to point that out since I saw some whiners complain about the tiny little random cycling ads. There is however a paid version with (I believe) no ads, plus more features. I'm pretty happy with t
__label__1 I am pleased with this app because it keeps track no matter how many days my period lasts. I have tried other apps and they have a limit on how many days your period can be,but this doesn't. It is simple to use and easy to find the data . I am very happy
__label__1 pink pad helps me keep track of when i am due so i know when to prepare myself and not have accidents.
__label__1 Keeps track of periods, ovulation, and intimacy.  Useful when my gyno. asks when my last period was. Nice to have when it seems your period hasn't shown up, you can check.  I use the notes space to mark when I am possibly ovulating.Cause not every girl i
__label__1 This comes in so handy! And it's great that you can put symptoms and choose flow. Really you can put as much or as little as you need or want to put. The one gripe I have is that when you're on the daily page filling in information you don't know what da
__label__1 love to see how things change even if all the cam's don't work. wish there were more cam's too. the beach one is very droll though.
__label__1 this game makes me feel like an Ninjas because I can see *EVERYTHING* so if you are looking for a really good game buy this one the $3.00 are worth it
__label__1 I cannot believe some people would give this app 1 star. It is incredibly flexible and fairly to set up.  It works very well. I am thrilled. o
__label__1 I like to see things around home and office so I installed net eyeballs to keep me in tune 24/7.
__label__1 I bought this to use as a baby monitor on my kindle fire HD with my foscam 8910W cameras. The app has a camera scanner so it can get most of the details for set up on its own. Once I figured out the difficult part of port forwarding using a YouTube video
__label__1 Best app Ever! I use this app all the time to watch my car and my patio door. It records images and sends them to my email. View live and it's only a spit sec. difference in time. Control your camera right from the app. We plan to add more cameras.
__label__1 I started with the Free version then paid to get the Pro version, since it included sound (it was only two bucks then)It works great.  I have two Foscam wireless webcams and use this software on my Kindle Fire HD. I can easily view the cameras from insid
__label__1 This full version allows you to have more cameras configured.  I've setup my cameras to be accessible through my router so this works real well.  It connects faster than the camera manufacturer's camera apps.  I've configured some of my relatives' camera
__label__0 the app ispy cameras is wayyyyyyy better and cheaper. het that instead. its way less confusing also compared.to this one
__label__1 I love it so much! theres just one problem. I was watching one of the cameras in Venezuela,and I saw a girl running from three guys and they all three shot her. so be caution.
__label__1 great app ever I get to see were I never thought I would  of sal when my bro sees it he laughs at me :(
__label__0 This app started locking up my Kindle Fire so bad I had to do a hard reset, plug/unplug the power cable, then do another hard reset again just to get my Kindle to unlock and come back on. After contacting the developer multiple times, I realised he just 
__label__1 I've tried most, if not all, of the ip cam monitoring apps for android and Kindle fire.  tinyCam supports more brands and does it better than the others.  The recent upgrade to support RTSP was timely and works great.  My hat's off to the developer.
__label__1 I love this app. You can travel the world and see beautiful scenery and what's going on in other parts of the world, right from the comfort of your own home!
__label__0 DONT BUY THIS APP!!! I can only see this one place in Virginia. The other cameras don't work. Besides, who wants to watch people just walk around?
__label__0 Does not do much in this unpaid version!.  Won't autodiscover cameras, really not much help in monitoring personal webcams. I tried the paid version which is much better, but quirks in our network configuration ultimately frustrated me.
__label__0 only 1 cam would load they should seperate apps for cell phones n kindle fires because I'm pretty sure our kindles don't have webcams waste of my time horrible
__label__0 Having used similar programs before, I couldn't believe how horribly-made this app is. After hours of frustration I gave up on using it.My issue may have been related to the hardware (KFHD) but I can't be sure.
__label__0 Well it could be me but I found it disappointing.It did not preform the functions it said it could do.Example is that when I had gotten an actual picture the camera would not turn in the direction I wanted.Also a short video about the use and functions o
__label__0 This dose not work. I hate how they mix up ittems for phones and for kindles. It is very stupid. :(
__label__1 You need this app to use with Worldscope Webcam streaming video.  Together, they enable you to see live streaming video from webcams around the world.
__label__1 this program is great to monitor my Panasonic ipcam. I noticed they took off the paid version off amazon just when I was ready to make the jump.  I use this app on a kindle fire and it works great.
__label__1 I started off with the free app of this and upgraded to the paid version (which is a great price!).  It enables listening and talking.The App works great.  I have a couple of Foscam wireless webcams and this program works great.  Can easily view, move, l
__label__1 This AP was free and installed quickly and easily on my Acer Tablet for my DLink Camera. You just need to know some basic information, IP address and it connected to my wireless network with no problem.
__label__1 the app is so cool you can see around the world at the military in Italy and so muchmore place and also get fireworks arcade its super fun!! :)
__label__1 very cool to see what peaple are doing.in sted of loking out my windo i can see whate peaple are doing on this app.
__label__0 It will not work on Kindle's or Kindle Fire's of any kind.  I believe It is meant for a Notebook, camera or a mobile Phone.  It was very disappointing  for me.  It does have a working example on the APP when you open it though. It will not work on my che
__label__1 i didn't no of it would work on kindle fire nut them Hetty heyyyy said yes and it definitely does
__label__1 My 11 and 8 year old kids tried this to spy on their brother.  They said it works great.  It's easy for them to use and understand.
__label__0 This thing doesn't work well, and it is too buggy. Once it stops my kindle, I couldn't shut the app down and so the kindle.
__label__0 I would give this -999999999999999 stars if I could all u can do is look at cameras in places where nothing is, and when u add a camera it doesn't ever load this app is worthless don't get it don't know why they even put it in android I already deleted i
__label__0 I have tried this app (and the pro version) on FIVE different Kindle Fire devices, and it freezes all of them! The developer has indicated that he does not care. Apparently he doesn't think there are enough Kindle users to worry about. This has been goin
__label__1 Setup took just a few seconds.  This has presets for both of the Android-based webcam apps I've used(Securet LiveStream and IP Webcam), which means I have a simple phone-to-phone video streaming solution.  Sweet.
__label__1 Now that 365gay is defunct, Edge has become our favorite source for gay news.  The Washington Blade is great online, but their app isn't as good as Edge and it doesn't work on tablets.This Edge app has become our new 'go-to' source for gay news.  They al
__label__0 I was excited to get this app. It isn't updating! The news is for the beginning of April. I don't know how to get this app in the current month. So disappointed. Can anyone tell how to fix this?
__label__1 lots of great info to keep up with the LGBT community across the country. cover the important issues & the fun events
__label__1 Lots of current news and small memory usage.The one thing I would like to see is it go into landscape mode before to make browing topics easier.
__label__1 As someone new to Wicca I do find myself frequently running into words that I am unsure about. And while I could look the up via the Internet, I am not always able to get at a computer. Also, sometimes the Internet will give you non-Wiccan meanings.
__label__1 you know I come here to get some useful wiccan apps for my kindle fire.and make the mistake of reading reveiws to see if its worth my money.but instead what I get is a load of fanatical crap being spewd out by a religious regard that's daring to judge my
__label__1 Perfect. Yes you can find these terms for free on the computer but it's nice to have them in one place and so portable on my kindle fire along with all my other books and journals. As for being forced to dance naked??  Don't make me laugh, that's simply 
__label__1 I have never been sexually abused by anyone in the name of this religion. I have never had sex with any other practicioners. I have in fact NEVER danced naked in front of anyone, much less &quot;wizards&quot;. I have also never met a &quot;wizard&quot;, 
__label__1 I think this is great for any one who likes wicca. and would not recommend to any Christians.  being a Lithuanian pegan I think u can learn about this way of life or religion through this app.
__label__1 this dictionary has words in it that I was unaware of... It is chocked full of information and worth having. Great for the novice or well practiced, an all around good dictionary..
__label__1 If you are just starting out or just sometimes have a brain fart, this is your go-to definer for the Wiccan.
__label__1 This dictionary is a very nice writing companion book for my desk. I use it often in my writing endeavors.
__label__1 I have been a wiccan for over 10 years a never once have I been made to dance necked or have unwilling sec with anyone you are clearly a fool who does not know what you are talking about and you sound stupid you claim to be a wizerd but yet state that yo
__label__1 I am a poor eclectic pagan who would love to use this app to further my studies but I have more important things to spend money on... please make this app free for a day so I can use it to learn and become closer with the Gods and Goddesses
__label__1 Got this for me because I have trouble sleeping but quickly discovered that it works wonders for my 10 year old. She has ADHD and sometimes has a hard time relaxing enough to fall asleep. On those nights I give her my kindle with this playing and she is 
__label__0 Did not care for this app, no special reason, just did not like it. Didn't like the features or the way it worked. Not what I was looking for.
__label__1 I always have a hard time getting to sleep, and i don't sleep deeply when i finally get there. I have used similar programs in the past and this one is of good quality. IT WORKS! I get to sleep fast and i sleep deeply all night long!
__label__1 Since I am an insomniac, I find that this app is so soothing and relaxing that I fall right to sleep. If you are one who has trouble falling asleep, I highly recommend this to you.In addition, I recommend this for general relaxation when stressed, I use 
__label__0 Did not like it at all. I wanted much more out of this. I wish that the relax part was much longer. About the time I was getting really deep and relaxed? I was brought out of it.
__label__0 This really suck, this is not for me. I was looking for something to ease my mind before going to sleep. And I was getting a headache listening to this voice. My opinion but its not for me. I will remove this from my Kindle Fire
__label__0 This app will NOT download the audio needed. . . he wants $4.99 go hive you the audio.  NICE TRY!
__label__1 This is one of my favorite apps for relaxation. It truly works for me and I rely on it on any night were I am too keyed up to sleep. And it's free too! How can you beat that?
__label__0 I am a professional insomniac as well as a mental health professional. I am married to a psychiatrist. I am surrounded by therapist of all ilk. I was not impressed by this guy and found myself rolling my eyes a great deal. I when I found out what he char
__label__1 I really love this app, as well as the sleep deeply app.I love that the apps are useful every day. I use them when I'm having trouble getting to sleep and also just to let go of tension.I've used it during the day just to center myself. My teenagers have
__label__1 If you're open to it it will definitely put you into a relaxed state and has multiple options to do so.
__label__1 the hi five star is for a well done on the sound quality.i like this and it is very smooth for the mind.
__label__1 So awesome I was at his mercy or at least I think I was and this helped me a lot.
__label__1 on those nights that I cannot just go straight to sleep I play this.. my worries drift and then I'm out like a light..if you stress out about alot of crap before bed try this out, its free dude so why not?
__label__1 I must tell you, I've listened to several other relaxation/guided imagery apps and this is the best so far! I can't get thru more than 4-7 minutes and I'm asleep! There are several videos you can watch at the same time, if you're still awake. FYI~ he doe
__label__1 This is the first time I have completed a sudoku puzzle by myself and I was  so excited and surprise .Yes, I did it by myself!!!I can see right now  this is going to be an addicting  habit.

__label__1 This is one game I can't stop playing.. It just make u thing were everything goes. I used to get the books Althea time, tell I got the on my iPad..
__label__1 I love playing this game. It's lots of fun. Some levels are more challenging that others (i.e. 2 might be a little harder than 3). It's seems random on which levels are harder. It's very fun and a great way to kill a little time.
__label__1 I downloaded this game for my 6 year old grand-daughter.  It is one of her favorites.  We have so much fun laughing at the animals when they tumble off balance.  Her mom and I also play it - it's great!  5 Stars!
__label__1 Cute puzzle game for adults and kids.  My kids think the animals are hilarious and it is addicting...you'll find yourself saying &#34;okay just one more level.&#34;
__label__1 The game provides users with a series of challenges - blocks must be removed without tossing the little critter on top to the ground. The difficulty increases and some basic physics must be intuitively applied to succeed. If you fail, you get as many cha
__label__1 love the features of thks app, does a really good job of keep track of your workout, calorie count and etc and u can even post on Facebook to show off to ur friends
__label__1 I'm happy to say I picked it up for free but it's worth $10, especially if you download all the other free pieces that attach to it (including regular Cardio Trainer and Calorific).  I set it up and started using it the first day and it's great. It works
__label__0 I used this program all the time on my Droid 2 and even had others purchase it because it WAS ths best one on the market.  A number of us now have the Galaxy s3 and the program is no longer compatible. It crashes the phone in the settings menu, and appar
__label__1 This app does what it says. I use it with Pandora when running.haven't had it that long, but I love it so far! Easier than other apps I have tried.
__label__1 For those of you using the Noom weight loss app by the same company, you know they included Cardio Trainer as part of that app. This Pro unlock key appears to work to unlock the pro features of the workout features of the Noom app so you don't need to in
__label__1 This is a fantastic app. it really helps you keep track of your runs and see your progress. It provides great motivation to see how far you have come and to push yourself even further. Definitely the best app of its type.
__label__1 I love this app. If you are a runner, this is for you. I've enjoyed the free version for months now. Get this free today, even though it's worth the ten bucks.
__label__0 Sad but true, used to be a very nice app. Without an update, it is not functioning as it should. Settings force close the app when attempting to change ANYTHING! -and mine is not a new phone! It should be removed fromed the market! Any developer who beha
__label__1 Used this today for an intense bike ride and I love the way it works. Couldn't ask for more in a workout app :)
__label__0 We are in a technological environment where we are updating hardware and software all the time. If the developer does not support these updates then then app, if not useless now, will be within a year or 2. Dont bother with this one. It simply isnt worth
__label__0 false advertising on this app. charged 9.99 when it states free. refund requested based on this. total dissatisfaction.c'mon amazon. better than this.
__label__1 I used Runtastic and that was great, but this program covers many more topics. While it doesn't have a space for BJJ you can create a custom slot for it. The GPS feature with maps tied in, and MP3 player included in the program is fantastic. Easily worth
__label__1 This app is worth every bit of $9.99. Where else can you have a fully functional bike GPS with all of the many tracking abilities this app has for &lt;$10. The linkage with Google Health is an additional plus. Also, Worksmartlabs.com has some neat featur
__label__0 Crashes on com.wsl.Cardiotrainer module each and every time I try to start a workout. Can't use it on my device I guess... Too bad. It looks very feature rich when it works.
__label__1 I was just getting ready to buy the pro version because I use to free version so much. This made my day. So many wonderful features.
__label__1 i agree with the previous reviewer.  this is simply an amazing that utilizes something i already have-my GPS-to do my daily jog.  as far as the complaints; I'm not sure what people are talking about as i found the whole install process straight foward an

__label__1 This is an app that was made for my phone.  I've always wondered why they didn't have one before.  Dropping $10 is cheap compared to how much I spent on my GPS watch and this tells me more and gives me a more customizable workout.  Not only that, it is e
__label__1 Cannot believe it's will find too many more apps like this that are as useful. I have been using the free one for a long time and I have enjoyed it. I have noticed that it runs a lot in the background and when it does than I just force close it myself if

__label__1 1. Make sure you have the cardio trainer installed not just the free app of the day all that is is a key to unlock the pro functions.2. leave 5 starts for the dev because this app is the best to ever be on android.
__label__1 i can see where this would be a ten dollar app, very impressive! i love how it automatically starts your selected playlist when you begin the workout. cleverworks flawlessly on my HTC Droid Incredible.
__label__1 I have used the free app for over a year and use it as a back up to my garmin gps on my bike.  Posts my ride automatically on facebook.  I ordered the polar bt heartrate stap should be here next week so I will be able to integrate heart rate data.  Not s

__label__1 Cardio Trainer is my new favorite exercise app replacing SportyPal. The interface is so easy to navigate. All of the controls that you need are right where you need them without a lot of extra stuff getting in the way. It is very easy to start a new work
__label__1 I have used this app for a long time and it is amazing. Works perfectly on my Incredible running CM7 with Chad's beta8 kernel. If you actually know what you are doing, you will never get a force close.
__label__1 love this app, used the free version for nearly a year. I sell Android phones and this is hands down the best workout app available. I use it on the HTC Thunderbolt. works great. THX for the free upgrade. :-)
__label__1 I'm surprised at how useful this is as a motivation to take the time to work out more often. It's an easy interface to use. You can start logging a workout in real time and then tell it when you stop. Or you can add a workout in later. It has a lot of pr
__label__1 I've used the free version of this app for a couple of months and had planned to buy it at some point this year. Now thanks to Amazon, It's an easy little app to use, I like how it plays my music for me while I'm walking and its fun that it allows me to

__label__0 This WAS my favorite app.  Worthless on my S4.  Please update it...I feel abandoned.  When it worked on my galaxy S...this app was a workout aficionado's personal beast!
__label__1 Once I casually mentioned how nice iPhones were and my girlfriend's first response was to frown and say: "But it doesn't have Cardio Trainer and Calorific." Well, I'm sure the iPhone has some great workout tracking apps of its own, but Cardio Trainer rea
__label__1 Really - this app does it all. I wish I could edit the type of workout after the fact - e.g. I recorded a running workout, but it was on "walking" so the calorie count was off. I'm so pleased with this app. It is making me work out more.
__label__1 I really like this app, and encourage anyone who walks, runs, or rides and has an Android phone to try it.  If you have an iPhone, encourage the developer to port it to iOS!  It shows stats on your individual walks like distance traveled, mph, number of 
__label__0 Installed the free app, then the pro. Both give FC shortly after starting. Seems like a great app and I'll look forward to using it someday. I saw an earlier post about it could be a problem on phones running gingerbread. I'm an htc evo user running 2.3.
__label__0 was working great on my old 2.3 version of android.... now I have ICS and I cannot change any settings... crashes everytime!!! plz fix, outside of that this app is AWESOME!!
__label__0 Bought pro from amazon and all of a sudden I can't get the new update that google market place has. Says not available in my country?Was hands down the BEST cardio app out there.I will change my stars when I am able to update thru market place or amazon.
__label__1 The Cardio Trainer Pro eliminates the ads. It is one of the few Amazon Free App of the Day apps I have.
__label__1 I've been using the free app for a year for running walking and it's a great motivator to get me to exercise. The default settings (exercise reminders, play your music when you exercise) can annoy, but if you take a couple of minutes to figure out how to

__label__1 I've started using this several months ago and it is invaluable for those wanting to track their progress. It has a wonderful little icon on your top bar that shows you how many calories you have burned and reminds you when you need to weigh in.
__label__1 it is a bit pricey, but I considered it more of a donate. the gps works well, never had issues with it. I use this for biking and running
__label__1 every boady knows that yoga could be boring but it is.  acutally. withing if you have a. quite place so get digital 3d yoga
__label__0 This app only has like 10 different poses and they are the most basic poses ever....I do not recommend this.

__label__0 this game sticks nevver ever ever ever ever ever download it on kindle fire game stinks don't waste your time
__label__0 This game only tells you the instructions at the beginning. Plus also,it wont let you tilt or move using kindle fire. (The instructions aren't very good.)
__label__0 this app doesnt work kn the kindle fire. you just cant seem to tilt the little man at all! please fix this problem!
__label__1 This game is truly one of my favorite games of in the market place and is a shame that is not supremely popular. I'm really not voting 5 stars because it suggests I do, but it's really a 5 star app.
__label__0 I like to download games for my three year old. He had no intrest in this game what so ever.
__label__1 this game is great but not my style. the controls are great and it goes by fast. i really like the adult and kids mode- which are diffulclty settings.

__label__1 Excellent app for personal finance. I replaced Quicken Basic and Money with this app. It imported my files with no loss or corruption of data. I use it everyday.Only drawback: must keep the Amazon app store app active or it won't run. That's not too bad.
__label__1 this game is completely awesome! the controls I had a hard time with but after a little bit, I figured out that its real simple. for all those people that say the controls suck, you suck because the only reason your going off the track is because you go 
__label__0 This is a really bad game. The steering is terrible. It has crappy handling.  Do not download this game. Do not waste your space.
__label__0 don't buy the lite versian thank God it was free but it sucked get the paid versian the graphics suck its hard to handle and you get only 2 cars and 2 tracks that both suck
__label__1 the best game ever you should try it and for every person who is out there that likes racing games should try it to.
__label__0 this app sucks. it is so hard to control and it gets boring in the first 2 seconds. do not buy this app unless you are in for never ending boredom.
__label__0 they have incredibly hard tracks to turn on and can only go like 6 mph to get around them. you will hit the walls and ever time you do they take away 1000s of your points. not a fun game.B
__label__0 I got this app because I love a fun car racing game. this is the opppisite. this game is rediculously impossible. dont get this app.

__label__0 this is a hard game don't get it.I downloaded it and I rather fall down the stairs than this stupid game.

__label__0 when I first tor this game I thought that it would be cool to play since I like racing games. no; do not waste your time. it is very hard to control the car and you will end up swinging your kindle or I phone or whatever all over the place trying g to st
__label__0 the first time I played this it was very confusing. then the next time I played this I hated it. I feel that all of this swerving around is making me dizzy. that is why I unstalled this game and will never install it again!!!!!
__label__0 by far the worst kindle game I have downloaded .asphalt adrenaline is better . its not worth being free . don't download!!!!!!
__label__0 its impossible to control the car. good graphics, no finish though. don't waste your time, you will delete it after two races
__label__0 Reali.U cant even control dis little app. Also u cant even race y would they even create dis uglii stupid dumb ol game
__label__0 This game is very bad. The controls are too hard, it goes too fast on turns, and it advertises the full version way too much. Do NOT waste your time getting this game.
__label__0 My husband downloaded this on his kindle and he could never even get the app to start up! We need up uninstalling it!
__label__0 Really bad and it is almost impossible to drive and you get no grip at all. Do not get this app.
__label__0 it is so hard to control and then you lose points for the game being horrible.  I didn't listen to the reviews and I really regret it
__label__1 Son loves this game
__label__0 I thought that at first the reviews were overexaggerating but then I tried to play the game and if anything it was underexaggerating this game is junk don't waste your time
__label__0 I got it thinking it would be fun but it totally sucked the controls are jaked up I suggest you don't get it
__label__0 This did not install on my Android 2.1 tablet. I have played this game in Linux and love it. It is too bad it doesn't work on the tablet.

__label__1 this app is more than i had expected,everybody in my family loves the Yo Mama,i use it everywhere,in my car,and at my house.
__label__0 I don't know how the ratings got so high on this app, the jokes are lame and very amateurish. I couldn't find anything worth a laugh in here. good thing it was free. Easy come - easy go........

__label__1 Hilarious!
__label__1 I love this app. its hilarious but some of these like the poor ones are unnecessary . but overall. these jokes are hilarious
__label__1 I think this is a great funny app because boys at my school and on my bus start having a Yo Mama joke-a-thon as they call it :D

__label__1 ha ha ha this app is awesome I love it...... my Conley conplant is if reapetes the jokes....... I still love it though ..............I would recommend it for kids over 10
__label__1 This app made me laugh so hard. Its one of my favotite apps ever!! I found some really funny ones too.
__label__1 its too funny I love it I tell the jokes at school when we have our yo momma joke compitision and I always win every one is so mad at me then but again I am the most popular kid in school
__label__0 This is so dumb! Why does almost every app want you to login to Facebook? What if we don't have an account, and we're not planning on making one? That's like discrimination! How do you expect us to use it if we don't have a Facebook?!? Good thing it's fr
__label__0 stupid app all it does is play your music i think it should be like pandora and come with music already on it........oh well........
__label__1 This is a straight forward gin game with no frills. The competition is pretty tough at the higher levels and pretty easy to beat at the beginner levels. This is a great game that doesn't take too long to play and isn't hard to learn.
__label__1 I like this game it's neat to play expectantly if you like gin rummy so I would recommend it iee get it
__label__1 great game, graphics are good, the AI characters offer a range of skill levels, which really helps set the game level. I play this all the time.
__label__1 Lots of fun and glitch free!! Very addictive:-) My boyfriend saw me playing it all the time, so much so that he finally began playing real Gin Rummy with me :-)
__label__1 this game is quite engaging! I can't seem to put it down !  it's my favorite app.  no complaints here.
__label__1 I used to play live Gin Rummy years ago and this is neary as exciting. I have played many hours already and plan many more.
__label__0 When you get Gin you can't go out, you have to do some knock thing and dead somethings are counted.  I took it off my device almost as fast as I put it on.
__label__1 This graphics are clear and the game controls are easy to master. I play for hours. I just love this game and you will too. The price is also right...
__label__0 If I could reach through and strangle those people I would! I get so tired of losing my status! Let the player win some will ya?!?!!
__label__1 I like this game because it moves the cards for me.  Puts them in order as they are dealt and when I make runs are groups, it puts them together.  Unfortunately, I don't win often.  My opponents are really tough and quick.
__label__1 I play this game all the time.  I wish I had it on my computer so I could play more
__label__1 Gin rummy is probably one of my most favorite card games and this free game really delivers. It is a great game and hard to put down. There are 5 different levels that you can play on from beginner to expert.
__label__1 I love that as you get better, you have more difficult players to face. Tournament mode is fun too as you face players of increasing difficulty and different styles. I'm soon gonna wish for more  &quot;players&quot; to face.
__label__1 This is a fun little app for my phone! I play it when I am waiting around!!!!! I would recommend it to a friend! My husband plays this more than I do!
__label__1 Great game.  Quickly became a favorite!  Would definitely recommend to all who enjoy card games.  Works great on Droid X.
__label__1 I have had lots of fun with this product, the implementation is really good and generally bug free.The UI is nice, getting Gin Rummy to fit in a small UI is never easy. I have a 3.7" screen and big fingers but I am able to pick out what cards without pro
__label__1 I downloaded this game many moons ago. After it I download apps daily but have been going back to good old gin rummy almost daily. It is just a very quick and enjoyable game that doesn't get monotonous.This game, with the variety of AI players, subtle so
__label__1 With today's update it gets five stars from me. I play this every day cuz I can start and stop and it resumes where I left it. My only issue was the size of the cards. I got a stylet to play with so I wouldn't accidentally toss the wrong card. With the n
__label__0 This game is too easy to make unintensional moves.  The cards are difficult to arrange and discard.  Don't waste your time.
__label__1 I am hooked...... I play this the most on my kindle fire. I love it. The best version I have seen..
__label__1 it is a very good game. don't see how people are saying it is too hard, maybe they don't know how to play gin. it is fun and very easy to use. I love gin rummy and this is really everything you could ask for in a gin rummy game
__label__1 Excellent game with different opponents and levels of skill. I enjoy changing opponents every 5 games to get a different perspective from another style of play by an opponent. Teaches good rummy skills.
__label__1 By far the best gin rummy game I have ever played. good opponents, nice graphics,and easy to play. I spend WAY too much time playing.
__label__1 I'm addicted to this game.  The graphics and sounds are great and I like competing with the computer which is winning most of the games ....so far.  I look forward to zooming ahead in games.  Try it.
__label__1 any free app could do without ads, but the placement of these ads werent so bad. i was able to learn the bare bones of the game just by reading the rules here and playing several practice rounds. luckily the game keeps track of the score for me.
__label__1 I love card games.  I love this app as a time waster while waiting in the movie theater etc..
__label__1 I play Gin Rummy every day.  I enjoy playing this game. I am glad it is free.  Every one that plays the real card gin rummy should try this game.  Enjoy.
__label__1 This game has good graphics and was easy to understand how to actually play. I would recommend it for anyone wanting to play Gin.
__label__0 the games controls r probably for know it alls. it gave me a headache. the controls r deffinetly horrible. I love rummy but not this
__label__1 playing on Xoom. plays great. I don't know why folks whine about getting beat. I constantly beat the AI. Then again, there`s more to rummy then just matching numbers. graphics are good, sound is authentic. best of all, it was free from amazon. good job d
__label__1 I waited on writing this review because I wanted to see if the things other people wrote in their reviews were true and I just hadn't noticed.1. The claims of soft porn ads....Completely False (unless you consider Disney soft porn).2.Cards being dealt mo
__label__1 I love this game and I spend hours playing it. It's addicting and I highly recommend it. I need three more words
__label__1 I like this game alot, it's just like playing with a group of friends. It is a fast moving game & doesn't get boring.
__label__0 There are several other gin games I like better.  Found this one a little bit tedious to manipulate.Requiring each review to meet a word minimum is dumb.
__label__1 I love that you get to choose your opponent. I am just competitive enough to feel pride on those occasions when I beat them.  Great graphics. No glitches. Great game!
__label__1 I enjoy playing this game quite often. I've now learned to play Gin, in addition to Rummy. Lot's of fun! Thanks!
__label__1 This is an awesome card game! It takes a few hands to get used to, but well worth it! I enjoy being beaten by the computer competitor...not for long as I get better every hand!
__label__1 If you aren&apos;t doing as well as you think you should you probably aren&apos;t playing on the right level. I do the best playing against Finn much to my surprise but I was always a very good rummy player as s kid. \n
__label__1 This app is great for anyone that likes to play Gin Rummy.  It is a lot of fun, especially if you can beat your opponent. There are several opponents to choose from to give you a challenge. I like to play this on rainy days and when I am being lazy. This
__label__1 I really like this game. Each character has different levels of strength, so the game stays challenging. I play this app on my Kindle Fire and have no problems with it or the loading. Good buy and always fun.
__label__0 This game sucks. It was fun until I noticed it was dealing cards previously discarded in the same game, drawing out of turn, and awarding itself more points when winning.  For winning the game (not the hand)  the game gave itself 5-10 points versus the m
__label__1 I've played recreational gin for decades and this is very like real games. Don't see what the complaints are about. I'd pay for this app. Can't tear myself away.
__label__0 I installed this in hopes of a good game and found myself uninstalling it in just a few minutes. They place the ads at the bottom of the screen where you will accidentally hit them while trying to get to the menus, and then most of the ads are nothing sh
__label__1 People need to stop being sore losers. When people write programs like this, they use a random command to generate the cards. Sometimes I win one, then lose one or win a few in a row or lose a few in a row. It's RANDOM. It's all about developing at strat
__label__0 they give u to many cards from how I normally play with 5 cards each person so I think this game doesn't even play gin right. DO NOT BUY
__label__0 honestly kids play these card games too! they definifltely don't need to see ads like this! what were the devs thinking?! change this please
__label__1 I got this game really didn't think I would play it that much I play it almost every night or when things are slow at work on my break.
__label__1 This is such a fun game!  I like that there are different opponents to play against. I can't believe this is a free game. Love it!
__label__1 I enjoy playing this game live so it is great to play it on my kindle fire. Great great. @
__label__1 i love this app. i do not have trouble with it freezing. i rarely win but i have a lot of options. i like this from Amazon rather than the market. as I have had a lot of phones it is easy to re download.
__label__1 My favorite game that I have downloaded so far. I play this game every day. I would recommend it to anyone who likes a challenge.
__label__1 I like that I can stop playing any time and pick up right where you  leave off.  Good graphic and easy to play.  This is great game and allows you play for ashort time or tealy get into.  I have never had an issue with the game closing or freezing.  Htc 
__label__1 First off, don't know what all the negative reviewers are whining about; the game doesn't cheat, it just gets progressively harder, just as it should! A gin rummy pro will not play a hand for 12 minutes until someone can knock with no dead wood, it's abo
__label__1 Beautiful graphics, and it plays wellGin is one of my favorite games and now I can play it as often as I want
__label__1 Fun
__label__1 Beautifully designed, plays fast, AI is fun to play against. One of my favorite card games. Running on an HTC EVO 3D.
__label__1 I chose this rating because I think it's the best gin rummy game available, and I highly recommend it to those who like to play gin rummy!
__label__1 Okay,I really love this game. I play at least 2-3 rounds everynight when I get home for work. Such a fun game..
__label__1 When you need to waste some time, this is a good game to waste it with. I play this often.
__label__1 Easy and fun to play.  Great to have when waiting in doctor office.  Love having a card game with out having to worry about the cards
__label__1 Anybody who loves Gin Rummy will love this game as well. Same rules and very addictive. I recommend this game to all card lovers!
__label__1 Love playing gin and this is the perfect app for me.  Graphs good and never shuts down, or not yet.
__label__1 THIS IS A great app and it was free. its the game of gin with 3 other players from the computer it also works on my pandigital )( see my review for that as well ) .Try some more apps from the amazon app store.
__label__1 Got this game on a whim. Ended up playing it all the time. Definately worth more than the price! Only down side is the inability to have &quot;house&quot; rules but that hasn't stopped me from playing!
__label__1 This is a fun game.  I usually play right before bed, so I know I have deleted my day.  Good one!  It's fun to change opponents, and they win as much as I do!  I recommend this game for brain balance and calming down.
__label__1 Lots of fun to play,  still a challenge to beat your other player.game goes fast if you don't have a lot of time.
__label__0 I didn't like this app, I didn't follow it, I was user friendly at all, not fun, not stimulating, boring.
__label__1 I love play rummy because it makes you thinks a lot and a card game and you can play it with yours friends.
__label__1 I liked this app. I play it when im bored at work when i cant read. I used to play as a kid so this was fun to have on my kindle
__label__1 Great game, I waste, I mean spend too much time playing this app.  Very well done, neat graphics, but not over the top. This was the 2nd Gin game I tried and the 4 or 5 afterwards were deleted so fast, they couldn't come close to this.
__label__1 I had not played in many, many years and was happy to find this app. It is well made with quality graphics. many options and modes of play. I would rather have the payed version tho due to the fact that in play it it&apos;s way to easy to accidently hit 
__label__1 #1: Ignore all the bad reviews BECAUSE I think they probably haven't played it long enough to REALLY  figure this game out. One person said it throws all face cards: Yes it throws a lot of face cards, but that is really an advantage because you can quick
__label__1 Great game and graphics.  You have several levels of skill and you can pick your own level.  You won't be disappointed.
__label__1 I have never played the card game before playing this one. What makes it interesting is that you can play 5 different players.
__label__1 Well worth it.  My favorite card game by far.  I haven't played this since I was little.  I was glad to see it on here.  THANKS!!!!
__label__1 I lost my standard gmail bookmark to a virus, so that this is a very fast way to replace it.
__label__0 I tried suing the app a few times and then I deleted this app - it was what I expected it to be
__label__1 I have a new android tablet and this helps me connect to my gmail account.  No problems so far.  Notifies me of new mail and allows quick email communications.
__label__0 The program crashed repeatedly on my device. Apparently, despite it being for the Android, it won't run on that platform
__label__1 this application is simple and helps me clean my e mails in order when i am away from home,  for me works just fine i would recommend it.
__label__0 Could not use this app. Not compatible with kindle.  Wasted time downloading and uninstalling immediately afterwards.  It probably is great if you own a Sony eriksson device.
__label__1 This app comes in handy at anytime of the day! I think that having this app is a very good thing!
__label__1 I got this app for my daughter's kindle.  We love furbabies and to have one on the other side cleaning our screen gives us a boost.  I would love a doxie on the other side, but any furbaby will do!
__label__0 this is so stupid it looks more like they dirty your screen so I'm deleting it. so so dumb ughhhhhhh
__label__1 My dog is adorable and he is a mix of a Boston terrier and a beagle, (hence the name Boggle). I got this app thinking the  black dog was Labrador. Plus the app looked insanely adorable, like the &quot;Dog Screen Cleaner&quot; app (with the pug). But it w
__label__1 The screen cleaner is superior to another I had. It has a choice of breeds and fascinates my grandson. What more could one want - except maybe an aardvark?
__label__0 app would not load, would not recommend this app for that reason. I had a version for my HP that worked well, but can't find that one for android
__label__0 Not at all like the android game on my phone. Was very dissapointed in it. Would not recommend to my friends.
__label__1 This is a fun little game. Easy to play. I have a version on my pc but this is perfect for the kindle fire. Enjoy
__label__1 I REALLY enjoy this game, play it almost daily! It's lots of fun and works great and is easy to use. It's actually quite addictive.
__label__0 I use to play Farkle Free on here and loved it. I accidentally deleted if and cant find it on here now. so I dl this one. the animation sucks, and the lag for the AI is stupid. Do not download.
__label__0 The graphics of this game are bottom rate.  It functions well, however I expected a lot better graphics given the picture that advertises the game.  I know it is a free game, but I'm still disappointed in the quality.  I won't be keeping this one on my k
__label__1 this is game is fun and addicting. i can play for hours and never get bored. highly recommended easy to use and excellent graphics
__label__1 It took me a while to remember how to play it. But one I got the hang of it I love it. This is the best on line version I have seen!
__label__1 Have Farkle in several different renditions and love them all.  Really like to play the game and would recommend game.
__label__1 This is Android excellant version of Farkle. I started playing on Facebook Android fell in love with the game! One thing that needs fixed is when the AI uses all the dice it doesn't roll again and it should. Also we know the name of the game, use that sp
__label__1 my husband plays this...I didnt care for it. but ones that like this kinda game it must be a five.he love it
__label__1 Used to play this as a dice game with grandma & she got my kids into it too, they also loved it. I remember it as having to get something like 750 points before you could start counting your score and it also went to 10k before you won & first person to 
__label__0 Ok so why even make a game if you can't play it on a gamers tablet.  I get the phone and was ok with that but really my ASUS T101 to not cool....
__label__0 It will not load on my Motorola Zoom.  just hangs at the loading screen playing annoying music.  please fix it.
__label__1 Drift Mania Championship is an excellent game.  Most touchscreen driving games utilize auto-acceleration, but Drift Mania allows you to fully control the throttle via their unique throttle bar.  The user can actively adjust the throttle input easily to c
__label__1 Awesome graphics, great sound effects, and an overall fun app. It takes awhile to get used to the controls, (you have to turn your device for steering control while utilizing the touch controls for speed/drift), but this game is definitely a 5 star winne
__label__1 Going to be a challenge to master the controls, but I can already tell this game will be a win.  smooth graphics too.  Droid Bionic
__label__0 Tried several times to attempt a dl and install but just tells me &quot;application not installed&quot;.  It downloads ok but won't finish installing.  Appstore won't let me send message about the issue either. Too bad, looked like fun.
__label__0 Getting used to the controls is a understatement! I have tried different control settings and unable to make 1 lap. Takes forever to load as well. Great idea though too bad. Motorola Zoom
__label__0 Im not the one to leave a bad review but this game was a complete fail from the start controls and graphics suck,but hey I can't say I can do any better
__label__1 Great looking and sounding app.  Very smooth graphics and runs excellent on my phone.  One review was right, turn camera stabilizer off, change gas to throttle and turn the steering sensitivity to the max and....PRACTICE.  No complaints, app works as int
__label__0 on g2x. just hangs on the loading screen. Id like to try it but I cannot. Would like to see this rectified.
__label__0 Your disclaimer excuses you from expectations of this app working on good phones? I get nothing but the loading screen...nothing else.
__label__0 Was looking forward to a game that I'd actually want to play. No such luck. Won't go,past initial loading screen.
__label__1 Controls took getting used to but I think it's because,  in the end,  they really open up the handling experience. Works great on my Evo.  Others' experience may be different...
__label__0 When I opened this game Honeycomb's zoom compatibility came up since it is not optimized for tablets. The game does not display at all and eventually closes itself.
__label__0 I really thought this game was gonna be tight but it is the lamest of lame I don't even like it when you move your phone side to side where u need to go it exaggerates it and there's no point in finishing the drift if you continue to go the wrong way or 
__label__0 does it not work with tegra 2 on gingerbread?game just sat on the loading screen playing that song for 5 minutes, I didn't give it a chance after that long.  my atrix loads everything else right now so I guess I can only blame this app.sorry dev I wanted
__label__0 ... butt controls.  Not even worth a free download.  Don't waste your time on it... really,  I'm not kidding,  just move along and find something else to play.  I hear Scrabble is nice.
__label__0 Junk,  Crashes or hangs at the loading screen on Moto Xoom 32gb. Free app of the day, and worth every penny of $0.00.  Don't bother.
__label__0 It didn't work as well as I had hoped and I'm one for car games. I was highly disappointed and deleted it within the week.
__label__0 Hard to control. With small phone screens, it's hard to control without being able to see more of what's ahead or what is on the sides until it it's too later, then crash. My driving skills are not great, maybe it's just hard to pick up the controls.
__label__0 I played this a couple times and the graphics were great, but that really doesn't matter since the controls and Atari era physics engine yield the game unplayable. I was going to try adjusting the controls, but I can't since now it's stuck on the loading
__label__1 Let me first say I'm not a big fan of racing games.  Yet this game has engaged my attention like a dropped clutch at 10,000 RPM... it took a few seconds and BAM! my skepticism was gone.The attention to the three-dimensional details, the audio and music, 
__label__0 Another iPhone app not optimized for Android. No exit functionality; you have to just press the home button, which makes Android run it in the background. Steep learning requires an extensive tutorial, which is not supplied with game. I got the hang of t
__label__1 Looks cool but won't work on my Tracphone. When are developers gonna realize not everyone has a smartphone. Can't even get it to begin the download process. Lame.
__label__1 This is a temporary review after I play with this app a little I'll give a proper review. I just wanted to be first to review this app.
__label__0 Not working on Asus Transformer or Galaxy? That is unacceptable. Two of the better tablets on the market and the free app doesn't work with them. Come on dev, catch up and get it going. And amazon should check functionality before releasing.
__label__1 this game has beautiful tracks and some good mechanics. I suck right now but I'm sure I'll get the hang of it.
__label__1 This game has an unfairly low rating. It does take some getting used to but after awhile you get the hang of it. Like others said tilt sensitivity the whole way up, camera down and use the throttle bar. It's allot of fun once you get some practice and fi
__label__1 at first I was skeptical. thought it must as every other browser. I was so wrong. this browser is awesome.
__label__1 Pretty impressive. I'm not a huge fan of the dolphin like gestures but it works pretty well for my kindle fire. Great job!
__label__1 Much much better, and faster, than the Kindle Fire's default browser.  I love being able to navigate back &amp; forth between pages &amp; tabs  without having to minimize the screen first.  Just slide the page a bit, and the back/forward &amp; tab button
__label__0 I hav nt found a real use for this app,perhaps you can find more by reading the 50 beast Kindle apps,manual,I found it to be the best free app in the entire app subscription!!!
__label__1 This ap is easy 2 use and convenient. I highly recommend it. Nothing extra to get in your way. No irritating ads.
__label__1 After just dloading and trying Maxthon for five minutes, I already can tell it's much faster than the stock kindle fire browser. Me like.
__label__1 Silk spoiled fast. Maxthon is simply superior. Way faster and much more customizable. With add-ons that integrate well with the Kindle Fire, it's interface is much more in line to what PC and Droid tablet users are used to, unlike Silk.
__label__1 The Maxthon browser is way faster and has better features than the Kindle Fire browser. I really like my Kindle Fire and this makes it better. I got the add-on that allows you to import your bookmarts from the Kindle browser of which I recommend for ever
__label__0 I found this to be rather user unfriendly.  Too many choices without explanation of the technical terms.I have found better browers to use than this.
__label__1 I really like this app. Its very fast. On my kindle fire I'm not sure if this turn my screen rotation off. With a reboot it fix the glitches. This don't drain the battery no more than other apps.  I think every fire and droid users to down load. I like t
__label__1 Maxthon is a real step in the right direction for android devices. So far it is the best browser I've found.
__label__1 A very light yet powerful browser. I use it every day. It provides an interactive GUI that makes browsing on my tablet bearable.
__label__1 I switched from Silk to Maxthon and love it.  pages load fast and the issue I had with the page jumping around while I was typing on Facebook is completely gone. I even installed it on my laptop to take the place of Chrome!
__label__0 After trying to use this browser for only one day I removed it from my Kindle. It was not very user friendly and I found it to be a little difficult to use.
__label__1 I love this browser and the cute themes I can set for the background. It allows me to set quick access links very easily and using the links is even easier. My only complaint is the tabs at the top, in full screen, overlap quick access buttons and someti
__label__0 I have tried out different browsers due to the stock browser features lack. Opera was working much better but an update bogged it down so I went hunting for a replacement. I tried this one and its not that great. I settled on the Dolphin browser as it ha
__label__1 my friend recommended this to me and now I only use this web browser when I am on my kindle fire. it is very fast and you can customize the viewing on the web browser which I think is really neat.
__label__1 This is the most easiest growers to use. It is so easy to use and navigate.  The interface is awesome. Works really great on my Kindle Fire.
__label__1 I got this browser because the one within my kindle fire is slow. I was worried that this one may be the same but I was pleasantly surprised. It runs pretty fast. I have no problems going to different web pages. I tried going to you tube and was able to 
__label__0 when I uninstalled on my kindle fire my amazon browser will no longer open so now I have to use this browser!  fix this please
__label__1 It does what it says and that meets my expectations. five stars all the way! free makes it that much better too!
__label__1 a must have browser for the fire..what a godsend. veryfast and intuitive. easy to set up favorite sites. you tube videos had stopped working on my silk browser, but that led to finding this amazing browser.
__label__1 This is much better than the built in browser that came with the Fire. This is seamless and handles like a dream.
__label__1 good easy to use u can watch videos and other stuff that u cant on the original one for the kindle update makes it nice to

__label__1 I like this browser much better than the one that came with my Kindle Fire.  easy to use and fast.
__label__1 never even heard of Maxthon and gave it a shot. very fast and I like the many options. give it a run. most give high marks.
__label__1 Facebook pages load much faster and actually show the pictures at a decent size.  Many of he sites I go to load significantly faster and the scripts generally work better (example: [...]crawls in silk and the buttons frequently don't work, but loads quic

__label__1 I left Firefox because it got bloated and slow. Then I tolerated the slow speed and quirks of Opera, but appreciated its sync-ability between Windows desktop and Android mobile. Then Opera stopped syncing and I went looking for an alternative. Maxthon al
__label__1 I downloaded this ap for my Kindle Fire.  I was looking for a different browser as the default Fire browser loads slowly.  This one is just what I was looking for.  I am still exploring some of the features but I use it all the time instead of the Fire b
__label__1 Got this for my Samsung Galaxy tab based on the reviews.  This is a very nice, FAST browser, with a lot of options the default Samsung browser doesn't have.  Glad I got it and will stick with it!
__label__0 This browser has no setting for avoiding mobile websites.  I like desktop websites, but Maxthon won't let me see them. It will only load mobile sites.
__label__1 A great and fast mobile web browser. for kindle fire it takes some getting use to but never the less this is a great and fast mobile web browser
__label__1 Awesome browser with a lot of optional customizations. Quick load times and efficient use of screen space. Really improved with the latest update.
__label__1 Finally a browser that handles imbeded formats!There is some learning to negotiate the tabs and bookmarks. Although visually handicapped, the renderings are pretty smooth.
__label__1 very nice addition to a kindle fire if you have trouble with the standard web browser I give it 5 stars worth the time to down load
__label__1 Well worth the download on the Kindle Fire. It blows away the built in browser, both in speed and functionality. No problems so far and is a great asset.
__label__1 I wanted to see if this would be faster; it is....I wanted to see if videos appear and run better...they do.  The sound on the videos sound crisp.  I am using it my Kindle and have had it for about 4 days...so fat so good.  try it if you do not like it y
__label__1 This app is great. I use it quite a bit to check my Facebook and various other things. I have no proof but I don't think that it will work if you don't have wi-fi. I'm not positive though. Great and useful app.
__label__1 Oh My Gosh. This browswer is sooo much better than the Amazon Cloud, default for the Kindle Fire. It is faster, doesn't freeze, and much easier to use. It also asks to clear your history every time you exit, which could be very useful to some people. I h
__label__1 This browser is not only fast but also has an intuitive interface. It outperforms the onboard browsers on the Kindle Fire, the HTC smartphone, as well as the kindle hd 8.9. Web pages (even highly complex ones) are rendered quickly and accurately. The fea
__label__1 I have a kindle fire and this app works great!!!  its very fast and it lets me watch videos on it.  idk why ppl say it doesn't let them play videos on their kindle fire?  it works perfectly fine on my kindle. Its a great app!
__label__1 Installed this after working with Amazon's browser that was slow.  It installed quickly and has run without a hitch for months.  Provides a complete menu of options.  Will continue to use.
__label__1 This browser is better than the browser that came on my Fire.  I went searching for a new browser when I was having problems connecting with the built in browser.  I chose Maxthon because it was free.  I didn't expect it to be &agrave; great app based on
__label__1 The speed is better than Silk and Opera, which is what I was using before. And it handles youtube's mobile site correctly, which I haven't seen Opera do despite three updates.
__label__1 Love the easy access for your favorite sites. and the quick access for the sites you go to all the time..
__label__0 webpages look totally different in this browser, cant click on certain links, I thought with the average reviews it'd be great, but im sadly disappointed. please fix it, I love the concept.
__label__1 pretty cool app nothing wrong even gives you an option to make certain movements to do certain things like go straight to youtube by drawing a smiley. its really fast to. and its free so go ahead and get it
__label__1 I'm very pleased with this browser. I was trying to decide on a newer browser to replace Silk on first generation Kindle Fire. Saw the good reviews and tried it out.  Glad I did. This browser is very fast and so far no problems at all.
__label__1 I have a first generation Fire and Maxthon is so fast it makes me feel like I've upgraded my hardware. I don't  prefer its interface over that of Silk (I miss Reader mode), but the improvements in the speed of loading and scrolling are worth it.
__label__1 My Kindle Fire browser stopped working after a month or so when it was brand new so I found Maxthon. Been using it for 2 years with no problems since!
__label__1 My Kindle browser kept crashing on me so I had to find a different one to figure out what was wrong with Silk. So I downloaded this one in hopes that it would be good enough to figure out my problem.It works better then expected. I love the gestures add 
__label__1 This browser is a good idea for an alternative.  This is my second go around with Maxthon Mobile.  I have been using it for awhile on my Kindle Fire.  I don't know what they did, but it seems to me maybe they have made some changes from the first time I 
__label__1 January 12, 2014this is an amazing browser. it is fixed so it plays all videos perfectly. it has since replaced silk browser.
__label__1 Very please with this app that open the door to see my Abc soaps again! I am able to see the site without problems so far. When I want to see you-tube I just choose Amazon browser when the window pops up. I never from both options make any the default so
__label__1 This is an awesome browser.  it is faster than Amazon Silk on my Kindle Fire.  Silk is supposed to be better because it is built for the Fire and is based on unique cloud technology but Maxthon is outstanding!  Download and use it; you wlil not regret it

__label__1 This browser responds exactly as promised. It is infinitely better than the stock version, responds quickly and is easy to use.
__label__1 This is a great app.  It is very fast and very easy to use.  I specifically downloaded this so that I could use Facebook in desktop view and it does just that unlike the default Kindle browser.
__label__1 This browser is awesome. I've been using it for a couple of weeks and I'm still finding little tweaks that make my web reading and navigation easier and more enjoyable. I love the use of gestures... Once you get the hang of them it becomes second nature.
__label__1 Maxthon is solid and easy to use.  Not a lot to adjust, IE settings, but you really don't need to.
__label__0 Amazon says it was downloaded, it isn't. Still stuck with Silk on my Kindle Fire HD and doing without most streaming video. Thanks.
__label__1 I have never had a better browser. no offense to amazon, but maxthon mobile is a whole lot better than amazon web browser. with maxthon mobile you use hand gestures to delete, add, and switch between tabs!!!!! you can also take a website on one device an
__label__1 I am using it on an Amazon Kindle Firs and it works great for my purposes.  I really like the menu layout and the basic options.  I have not installed any of the available upgrade features.
__label__0 Didn't work for me.  I tried installing/removing/installing several times with no luck.  I've heard that it is "the best" but who knows who came up with that claim.  I spent way too much time trying to get it to work on my Kindle HD 8.9" tablet so I'm bu

__label__1 this is a nice browser. plays Online streaming very well. tabs option is really cool. predictive browsing is done very well.
__label__0 Just an absolutely terrible browser.  It crashes all the time and doesn't do a good job of rendering pages.  Nope.
__label__1 This is a fast and very customizable browser. The speed is very impressive. Easy to manage favorites and to export web page articles to my Pocket application. Very glad I installed it.
__label__1 Very fast compared to the Amazon Browser. Love its attractive design. And possibly due to changes or upgrades, it can play Youtube videos.5 stars no doubt.
__label__1 Love that I can finally watch Tv shows online with my Kindle Fire. I couldn't do it through the regular web browser.
__label__1 Tried this out on my Kindle Fire and it is very good. This makes surfing the Internet easy and more like my laptop. Definitely a favorite.
__label__0 Description says it is compatible with Kindle Fire HD when it in fact is not. Please fix this so that I can get it on my Kindle Fire HD.
__label__1 This app made it possible to log into my weight watchers mobile app.  I don't have a smart phone for the mobile app so this works just great.  you still have to be a member to log in.  This app makes it possible.  I was told to try Chrome or Fox Fire.  T
__label__1 Maxthon offers great tabbed browsing. Better than the IBrowser and the Amazon Silk browser.  I used Maxthon on a first generation Kindle Fire.
__label__1 I was ready to return the KFire because I  disliked its slow response for web browsing but kept it after I downloaded the Maxthon. It noticeably increased web browsing speed.The Max is user friendly and gives one more options.

__label__1 the amazon browser acted up sp downloaded this browser and was pleasantly surprised by ease of use and quick tesults
__label__1 there are loads of funny to educational shows like youtube loop or car wrecks there is also a program where you can watch cartoons.
__label__1 This browser is 10 times better than Kindle Fire's Silk browser. Amazon should be ashamed of themselves with all of the Silk problems including never remembering this previous page you were in on Google and only optimizing the best view for Amazon's webs
__label__1 Thank you to the developer!  It's an amazing browser compared to the one that Kindle comes with (which is God awful). It's pretty much identical to the Chrome browser - nicely done.

__label__1 This is so great! I love the way you can easily set favorites and access your favorite sites. :) LOVE IT!
__label__1 Great browser for my kindle fire.  For some weird reason my web went down and I can't even get into my amazon silk browser, but the Internet still functions great.  I wouldn't be able to still surf the web without this browser.  Love how its set up too.
__label__1 This browser is far superior to Amazon's Silk browser. Very fast and a lot less clumsy. Browsing the web isn't such a chore anymore. Highly recommended.
__label__1 it works like a charm I couldn't get on one of my websites until now when I got this I could get on anything yahooo
__label__1 I love my Kindle Fire, but not really impressed with the browser that comes with it.  This one is easy to use and has many options to choose from.  It is much easier to navigate as well.
__label__1 I love this awesome browser... I could not believe all the features it has... I am able to watch videos, read books and catch up on the daily blogs. I love this browser, download and enjoy!!! Its free...
__label__1 This is a wonderful customizable browser. Very easy to use and i love that you can choose a color theme. I've chosen pink! I haven't heard of another browser like this before. All around a nice addition to my kindle fire.

__label__1 I love going on the Internet, but since I am usually busy, all I have to do is connect to the Internet.
__label__1 this is an epic browser. so much faster than the stock browser and reminds me of chrome. very fast, and has loads of working plugins!-one complaint is that a keyboard cannot be opened for games like miniclip.
__label__1 I've never heard of Maxthon browser and stumbled on it while searching for Firefox &amp; Opera. Its way quicker than Amazon's silk browser. A must have for any Kindle fire owner!
__label__1 I love this app...very helpful my original web browser was very slow and did not work but this is easy to use and very fast!
__label__1 I'm going to heed other reviews and NOT update this app. I seldom do as the Fire's old OS doesn't seem to benefit from newer versions. Silk is so annoying I could go on and on but one thing in particular drives me crazy. Silk keeps remembering tabs from

__label__1 I recommend this app if you want to use your fire for web browsing. It's faster than the built in browser in the Fire and is more responsive as well. I'm very glad that I've been using it and you can set it as your default browser as well.
__label__1 really like this app do every thing I like. the regular browser is ok. but not like this one you actually can view stuff which make it a very good app.
__label__1 Really love the interface and the use of gestures.  Very fast, doesn't hog up resources (I am guessing).  Remembers your last tabs if you want it to (although this can sometimes be a pain if  you have many open and just want to reopen the browser to look
__label__1 I love this app because u came do stuff that u cant do on the Internet like watch videos that u cant watch on the real internet
__label__1 first waaaay better than silk browser....faster and responsive...pages load quickly and clear for both mobile and full website pages....the pages are clear and precise and they dont lag like silk does when you scroll down or up...videos play fine althoug
__label__1 I use this app every time I use the Internet its cute too when you scroll it has a yellow tracer following your finger
__label__1 my kindle silk browser wont open so I am trying this. works great! probably wont go back to silk even if they do ever fix it! thanks!
__label__1 I have only taken it for a short test drive but liking it much so far. Fast and light. Have not tried youtube yet.
__label__1 Works wonderful.  I was having a hard time reading facebook and other pages on my kindle fire.  This program has solved 90 percent of my problems.  I like the way it links to gmail.
__label__1 This is a great browser for KINDLE FIRE. It shows how fast or slow pages are loading. and I prefer it over the Silk for downloading.
__label__1 This is honestly the BEST browser I've ever used. I was an avid fan of Google Chrome, but since I downloaded Maxthon Mobile Web Browser, it has replaced Google Chrome on my laptop as well!! Its FREE and FULLY FUNCTIONAL!! I really like the custom gesture
__label__1 Easy to use &amp; personalize! Love that I now have my Chrome bookmarks on my Fire.  So quick to load pages....love, love, love it!
__label__1 Maxthon Mobile is very good!! I downloaded it on my kindle fire and it works perfectly. I don't know why people were saying in other reviews that you couldn't watch videos on youtube. You can. I like it a lot. I highly recommend it. GOD Bless you and I h
__label__1 for some reason that Amyzon cant fixI can no longer download apps from the Amyzone cloudI found another source and this works just fineno thanks to...............
__label__1 After a recent update the few problems it had have been ironed out. With the additional applications within it making it much more custom, it is one of the few applications that I have given all 5 stars.
__label__0 When I first installed this app, I was thrilled with it. Not so much anymore. The last two updates have seriously affected the quality of the service. Now, it freezes constantly and is soooo slow when it does work.I've waited about two months, hoping for
__label__0 even for a free app this was a total waste of my time. I gave this app 2 chances. And both times I've had to do a reset on my Kindle Fire. Deleted!!
__label__1 This browser works more quickly than the native Silk browser on my Kindle Fire. I haven't used it much yet, and I have read reviews where there are issues with launching YouTube from browser links, but I haven't tried that yet and cannot comment.
__label__1 this browse is fast. makes my kindle-fires web tab, look silly. if you get this you will be pleased.there's an opinion of clearing your history before you exit,that's pretty cool. and there's different add-ons you could use.
__label__1 I can watch youtube on my kindle fire with. this browser. so cool!!  so glad I found this one. I highly recommend it
__label__1 Love this browser! I was not a big fan of the stock kindle fire browser so I was willing to give this one a try and I happy I did. Don't just take my word for it give it a try for yourself.
__label__1 There've been many sites I simply couldn't visit with the Kindle Fire browser because it wouldn't display the sites properly. Maxthon's whole experience both tech functionality and the smart UI design far exceeds those of Amazon's pre-loaded one. Pretty 
__label__1 Run very well on my Kindle Fire. Better than the provided browser. Runs faster and has more features. I'm very happy with it.
__label__1 I have only had this app for a few days ....but I love it!!I would recommend to anyone....however as someone else has mentioned a problem w/ 'you tube' videos not playing...they seem to work fine on my Kindle Fire.The best thing about it is when I am usi
__label__1 pretty smooth. a good alternative to the silk browser that the kindle fire comes with. fast. good options. I just read a bad review regarding youtube which I haven't checked yet but will. but for free I really like this browser.
__label__1 I'm sorry Amazon, your Silk browser isn't good.  Never has  been really and in recent months has only gotten worse for me.  It has usually been slow and more recently crashes way to often.  Maxthon to the rescue!  I'm enjoying browsing now on my Kindle F
__label__1 seems to play more youtube videos than silk is capable of too.  I like the gesture based navigation as well.
__label__1 Amazon should learn from these developers! It is so much better, faster, smoother than the original Silk browser! I cannot believe this is free!
__label__1 I love this App.. Everything you love at your fingertips. I never write reviews. but this one deserved one..... ...... ...
__label__1 the silk browser was making me open 20+ tabs everytime so I needed a solution, this is perfect. and the add ons... I love getting to draw a house to go to my home page. download this now!!
__label__1 Maxthon is fast and does everything I have tried without hesitation. My only wish is a dark mode. akin to Greader Plus, which is an RSS reader and not a browser. But Mathon does everything else quite elegantly.
__label__1 it is faster and I can attully watch youtube it is alsome and free I highly recommend it most get
__label__0 I turned off WEB ACCESS in parental controls, and set DOWNLOADING APPS to password only in an effort to protect/restrict my child from the internet. This app had been downloaded months ago and then uninstalled from the kindle. However, since it was not d
__label__1 Quite an amazing program! It is able to browse easily and even play videos on youtube. I highly reccomend this broswer
__label__1 I've had no problems with any sites using the Maxthon Browser. Even videos play well. I've been able to do my banking also.
__label__1 This browser solved all the issues I had with the amazon browser that came with my Kindle. Now it doesn't revert to desktop mode on Youtube and it let's me go back a page without taking me back to the main page.
__label__1 Works great on my Kindle Fire and is a faster browser than Amazon Silk.  Makes it easy to watch videos.
__label__1 this browser is good when other browsers won't work.  i like watching YouTube videos using this browser on my tablet.
__label__1 This browser works extremely well. It's so much faster than the Fire's silk browser and it even allows multiple tabs to be open! Love it! :)
__label__1 Been using Maxthon for a long time on the PC and love that it is on the Kindle Fire.  Gestures are a plus.
__label__1 I like this web browser app. When I use the one that is already on my kindle fire there are a few things that are just hard to work with. On google.com for example, on the Maxthon I can just swipe through pictures, on the other app I have to click in and
__label__1 I like this browser over the stock browser that came with the Kindel Fire. The only knock or complaint that I have is how it handles You Tube videos. It does not play in full screen mode.
__label__1 This new browser, being much better than the default browser has now become my favourite app! It is very fast, streamlined, and to top it off it looks great! I don't usually leave reviews, but Maxthon really deserved this one!
__label__1 A friend told me of this app when my DSL was down for a week and all I had was my Kindle Fire. I needed to get on line to view my paystub and check on some bills.  Linked to the WIFI at work I downloaded this app and was able to take care of business in 
__label__1 Wow. This totally blows the stock browser (Silk) out of the water. Much faster performing, runs like a charm on my Kindle Fire. Now if I could just get a better keyboard....
__label__1 Your browser helped stabilize the web-based work I conduct on my Kindle Fire. Looking forward to future revisions of your product.
__label__1 I really like this browser it works quickly and efficiently.Getting on the web was slow with what Kindle Fire had put on their machine but this browser made a huge difference.I highly recommend downloading this app.
__label__1 this browser is great. it runs smoothly and the gesture add on is the best feature. go anywhere on the web with a simple gesture for example to go to youtube I just draw the letter y on my screen! the download manager is also a big plus being very simple
__label__1 It is really a very good browser ..beyond my expectation. works fast and doesn't crash. more like google chrome but better than chrome.
__label__1 I gave up on surfing the Net with the Silk browser. Silk is slow and buggy. Maxthon works fantastic on the Fire. It is very fast. It is easy to use and navigate. I'd give it 10 stars!!
__label__1 I wish reading mode would work on more news sites. despite this, the browser is solid and better than the default kindle fire browser.
__label__1 Also, it does a much better job at showing desktop pages and it may not be as fast as Silk, but I think this is good enough. A nice alternative to the KFIRE browser. Although it has its downsides, like crashing for me ocassionally for me, its still good.
__label__1 This app is GREAT!! My Internet on my kindle fire stopped working?! So I was looking for an app to replace it. And let me tell u, this app is AWESOME! Its fast, quick, and GREAT! I really recommend this app for undecided customers!! :)
__label__1 Maxthon Mobile was a very fun browser to use along with Silk. It has many great features. Silk and Maxthon are both great browsers. If you are a person who likes trying different things, than I recommend this app!
__label__1 I have not seen many of the problems listed in the customer reviews. it's free or I wouldn't have tried it. what I like: The home screen. the settings menu with all the options. the one click clear all for cookies history etc. If you share your kindle, t
__label__1 As said, it does not scare you do wake you. It increases volume as promised. I love all the options on how to wake you up, expecially the math problems. It stops me from always hitting the snooze! Love it:)
__label__1 Before this app, I had a problem falling back asleep after my alarm clock would go off. Since using this app (about 2 months) I have not fallen back asleep once! Apparently doing two &quot;hardest&quot; math problems while having a random Avenged Sevenfo
__label__1 I absolutely love this alarm clock. I use it on my kindel fire. You can customize it however you want it, from the Color to sound. My favorote features is how the volume of the bell slowly increases. I also like how when the alarm clock is going off I ha
__label__1 I am a heavy, heavy sleeper and an avid snooze button user!! The solve a math problem option is perfect for me and forces me to become conscious before I can snooze the alarm clock.
__label__1 I downloaded this app while on business trip because I was afraid I would oversleep.  I didn't really trust the alarm in the room and hate wake-up calls, so I decided to give it a try.It works!  It woke me every morning without fail, allowed me to snooze
__label__1 I have had none of the problems others reported. my guess is they installed to an sd card.I have 3 stored alarms and select whichever one I want to go off. The installed ring starts quietly and ramps up. just make sure you leave the volume set high befor

__label__1 I think this is the best alarm clock app there is. Alarm Clock Xtreme Free is very useful. I use it every morning. I have tried other alarm clock apps for the Fire but some of them delay or do not even ring sometimes. This one wakes you up every time you
__label__1 I've been using this for about a week now, on my Cruz T301, with satisfactory results.  I'm also pleased that it includes a countdown timer.  I like the included ringtones, especially "Medieval Jaunt" which I've been using as my wake-up alarm.  This app

__label__1 this alarm clock is a life saver.  I recently had an accident and had to take my pills at several different times of the day.  even firming the night this alarm went off to remind me.  it goes off while I am at the GROCERY;DOCTORS; etc.  It has not faile
__label__1 this app has replaced the use of my alarm clock.  I like all of the customizable features. I would not say that it now keeps from ever being late to work,  but the hard math problems most of the time make me think way more than I would like to and help m

__label__0 I just didn't trust my KF to turn itself back on in order to make the alarm sound.  I'll stick to setting the alarm on my cell phone.
__label__0 I set the alarm on this five times to hear how it would sound, (and yes before you ask, the volume was on and working). and the stubborn little app wouldn't perform. Could have been me, but, I just didn't like it.
__label__0 Too quiet. Gradually gets louder but still h a rd for me to hear with the  volume turned whole way up.
__label__1 This is one of the most vital apps I have on my phone, and I use it 6 days out of the week.  Alarm Clock Xtreme is the most feature-rich alarm clock app I've used on any phone, thus far, and I'm quite pleased with it.  I particularly enjoy being able to 
__label__0 I set it for seven so I could get up for class. it woke me up at eleven and I got a week of detention. thanks for reading before you get
__label__0 Why is this app listed for the Fire? It says &quot;the phone must be on for the alarm to work.&quot; The Fire DOES NOT HAVE A PHONE! According to the instructions, it also requires a GPS.
__label__1 An easy and very useful app for keeping track of time.  We use it mostly for the alarm but also on the timer which is effective without being too annoying!

__label__1 cool app very customizeable very reliable and fun. Easy to learn and lost of settings. works great on kindle fire.

__label__1 Great alarm clock! It's nice having as many different alarm times and days as I want. Plus each can have their own sounds. I think my favorite part is that each can be labeled with whatever I choose.  So if Saturday morning comes & I can't remember why I
__label__1 The timers are accurate.  The sound effects awaken me without being too obnoxious.  I've been using it for years with no problems.
__label__1 This is really good if you need to have multiple alarms set for several different days because it shows which ones are active and when they're going to go off. What's really good for me and probably many others, there is an option to repeat an alarm. If 
__label__1 I like the tones and the constant action.  We are not late now and we enjoy the ease of use.  thanks
__label__1 I have been using this app faithfully for about a year now.  This is the best alarm clock I've tried over the years.  I have no complaints and I've never had any issues using it.  I love the fact that I can set multiple alarms and am able to hear the ala
__label__1 this is on of the best alarms I ever used so ya I think you should use this and plus it is for free yeah free what's up
__label__1 it was the best thing ever when I have school my mon doesn't wake me up but this thing does.
__label__1 This app is the perfect alarm clock. It's reliable and always accurate. Also, you can preprogram it for days, weeks, or months if you wish. There are an infinite number of sounds/songs you can set as the tone as well.
__label__1 To all those complaints regarding rights and such, that is ONLY if you want to USE the gps etc. Features, which I don&apos;t. Wish they would actually use the app before giving it negative marks
__label__1 Awesome application never fails and I use more than one alarm setting to help me manage my daily reminders too
__label__1 I got this app for the timer. However. Volume does not work on my Kindle Fire HDupdate... just put this on my phone and works great on it.
__label__1 I think I like this app, but I can't really remember, actually I don't even remember if I still have it on my phone......
__label__1 I use this every day and it has never failed me. It does have a few flaws like once it set 75 alarms for 8:00 am and sometimes it will chime when the alarm is set for music, but all in all a great app!
__label__1 This is a very fun alarm app!! It works very well! I like how you can make it start quiet then it makes it louder and louder! And I like to solve math problems so you have to wake up to press the snooze button!
__label__1 I love this app! It's so cool i can have as many alarms as i want! And i can set how many times i want it to go off and how often.it's very efficient for every day alarms. I can't believe it's free! The quality makes it seem worth allot more. Get this ap
__label__1 With this application running in the background I never again have to worry about reading or playing games too long, I simply set the timer and it tells me when I need to stop and get ready to go or get back to work.
__label__1 I can not believe how good this is if I turn it off it still works I love this app give it a try it will wake you up
__label__1 Definitely my favorite alarm app. Like naming my alarms.  Like the graduating volume of alarms. Works perfectly. Easy to set up each alarm.
__label__1 As others have mentioned, this app can really wake a deep sleeper.  I've basically retired my alarm clock and use this app exclusively. Haven't slept in yet (knock on wood). I like the portability of the app too.  It is easy to set the alarm before takin
__label__1 i have been using this app since december on my kindle and it works great. love you can set multi alarms and you can set it so many ways.  great if you have a teen you can set it that only a math problem will turn alarm again.... great free app. may do t

__label__1 have had it for over a year now, waking up when it tells me and that and it works great.  Recommend it highly.

__label__1 Super customizable and very low resource drain. Highly recommend. Includes multiple alert options. Five Star speaks for itself. Yup, and indeed.

__label__1 Love this app. My phone was having issues with a virus so I downloaded this to wake me up in the morning for work. There are tons of different tones that you can use. I also like the math problems. You cant turn off the alarm until you solve 3 different 
__label__1 On track better with having it then without it. I have had this one since I don't really remember, but it's worth it all. Goes off right on cue every time. Sometimes I use it to do a check on my Other apps with it when a time limit is on one or more at t
__label__1 I needed a simple alarm clock to wake me and this does the trick. No big whoop.It's back up for my main alarm.
__label__1 Works great on Kindle Fire.  Multiple alarms with no issues.  Countdown feature is nice.  Very customizable.  I tend to keep a charger by my bedside to charge unit while sleeping so battery drain is not a concern for me.
__label__1 First off I want to clarify my device so other reviews know if they can trust, I run a kindle fire not he he version which I have read has problems with aime apps. Anyway the alarm is great and completely adjustable, aime complaints were they weren't lou

__label__1 This is a well-thought out app that is full of features. I am very glad to have this one and it is the only alarm clock I need. I retired my other bedside clock.
__label__1 I like the easy use of this app.  I don't need it very often but like having it installed.  At first I didn't think it was loud enough. I didn't have the sound on the fire itself turned up enough....oops.  Works just great.

__label__1 I think this app is great.  it does not cost anything so its cost is great :)  and it works great I don't seem to have the battery problem like some people say
__label__1 I use this alarm daily on my Kindle and absolutely love it!!!  Great and AFFORDABLE!!!  ;)  Easy to Figure out and set times and days and sounds.
__label__1 I like that it can be set to different ringtones, and even more importantly can be set to start softly and increase volume gradually if you don't hear it at first. can also set time between snoozes - even set to shorten time between snoozes gradually. No
__label__1 I needed to wake up everyday at 7. it seemed impossible. but after using this app, I woke up at 7 o clock everyday. it has a lot of options for snoozing, and disamissing. also, you can control the volume and the sounds. all I can say about this app is...
__label__1 It wakes me up in the morning to a ringtone or an mp3.  I can depend on it so I like it.  It turns my Kindle Fire into an alarm clock with a back up battery built in.
__label__1 What can I say? It works great and has lots of alarm tones to choose from. Gets me where I need to be on time. I love it!
__label__1 I use this alarm every day. it works perfect for what i need. The fact that it is free makes it even better. I completaly disable snoozing because it is actually bad for you to wake up and go back to bed for a few minutes and get up again. all the featur

__label__1 I use this every day! I cannot imagine going back to a regular alarm clock or clock radio. I have this on my Android phone and it is both simple and efficient. With a quick look at my phones status messages, it shows the next alarm set so I can go to bed
__label__0 It was working for the first five months then it stopped during one days and I almost missed the bus!!! What do you have to say for your self angel labs?!? I almost missed school!!
__label__1 I haven't used a traditional alarm clock in over a year. I love this app. So many options, but you can make it super-simple too. Pair it with the Sleepytime app, and make going to sleep and waking up easy and completely personalized.
__label__1 use it everyday  easy to setup alarms well wrote application  would recommend the app to all those that need alarm can use rings or music

__label__1 I love this app, best Alarm Clock app I found. It has a lot of customization and works 100% with my Rooted HTC EVO 4G
__label__0 Installed and uninstalled in 2 minutes. Alarm does not go off if device is in sleep mode. So whats the point.
__label__1 It works extremely good with my kindle. I get to set my own music to wake me up. This is an incredibly useful app.
__label__0 The alarm clock does not work at all. If I could have given a zero star I would have. I was excited but after waiting for it to wok for 4 days I gave up.
__label__1 Its on the Kindle!  My daughter uses it, and it's just about the only way to get her out of bed and on time!

__label__1 This is a great alarm clock and easy to set. I hear it everyday when it goes off. I also like that it will tell me how long until the alarm is goes off.
__label__1 I love this app. It wakes me up every morning for school at 6:30! and if you need help in math, then you can have it set to only solve an equation to stop the alarm!
__label__1 This app is my all time favorite it lets me wake up to my music that I have on my Kindle Fire and I am proud to approve this app 100% so if u want to have an alarm for waking up to taking ur meds this is it
__label__1 Very loud and bothersome. Perfect for rock hard sleepers like me. I suggest getting this app. And its free so what you got tooose? Download now!!!!!!

__label__0 Not a good one. Don't waste your time. It drains the memory and is not worth it. I deleted it as soon as I got it.
__label__1 lol to the deaf that rated this awesome app only three stars because the htc evo didn&apos;t vibrate hard enough for him to feel it.  how does that have anything to do with this app. get a new phone. great app, works well
__label__1 For me, judging an alarm clock comes down to 3 things. This app passes all 3.1.) I've used it everyday for months, and it's worked every single time.2.) There's several choices that are actually LOUD enough to wake me up if I'm in a deep sleep.3.) It loo

__label__1 It is a great alarm/timer app. Very simple and easy to use is much appreciated. Dependable, accurate and loud enough to wake me up every time.Free is a good thing.
__label__0 I don't find that any alarm clocks work well on the kindle.  Too hard to turn off when it goes off in the morning.
__label__1 Works great as an alarm and timer for my Kindle Fire.  Would recommend it for Android users.  What else can I say but why is there a minimum word requirement for these reviews!
__label__1 I needed an alarm clock traveling and it will turn on even if you have a screen saver.  It wont turn your PC on-so you need to make sure your device is on.
__label__1 NUMBER ONE TIME PRODUCT WHICH I ENJOY AND FEEL IS A NECESSITY IN OUR LIVES AND THAT I USE DAILY
__label__1 wish I could get better scenes but it's free so I wont complain. This is filler since i cant get off yet gkgkgkgkgkgkgklflfldldldldldldldoeoeoeoeoeoeoeoeoeoeoddldlldldldldldldldlldldldldldldldldldldldldlllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll
__label__1 This app is very customizable to fine details... I have difficulty with alarms that blare, don't snooze, aren't loud enough and just about any other annoying issue...This app satisfies every need I have for an alarm that is not typical... I highly recomm
__label__0 I just could not get it to sound louder than a whisper. I tried all the different options to no avail.
__label__1 this app is a great way for me to make fun of my brother and sister because I don't tell them in their faces (joke)
__label__1 I don't use it for anything more than an alarm clock but it's great! I love that I can set multiple alarms and that the alarm starts quietly and then builds.
__label__1 1. Can create tons of individual alarms each with different times and/or settings2. Tons of different alarm tones to choose from3. Can set max # of snoozes allowed from 0-unlimited4. Dismiss method can be press and click, shake the device, captcha or mat

__label__1 This is for the stupid people who's rated /t bad and said u can not set it for weekends. Guess equate you can overall best armament clock app ever and yes for kindle fire.
__label__1 I love the way the alarm turns on softly and slowly gets louder.  Wakes you up gently rather than with a loud blast of sound that jerks you out of your sleep.  I use it all the time!
__label__0 Could never get it to work correctly. Tried several of the modes. No sound no matter what we did. Don't bother.
__label__1 This is simply the best thing since sliced bread!Since I usually fall asleep with my Kindle, the alarm is already set with a wide variety of 'alarm sounds' to choose from, multi-time settings, snooze... Just great, great, great!
__label__0 I want an alarm clock that is easy to use and can put appointments in, this is just not it. So no I would not recommend it to a friend.
__label__1 It works like a charm. It gets me up for school, and tells me when its time for bed. I highly recommend it.
__label__1 This is a neat little app that is very easy to use and does not take up much space on my phone. Thanks
__label__1 Super alarm that I can make custom for me.Its a must have for anyone who uses their deviceto help keep them on schedule.

__label__0 It was a free app and most definitely worth the price. Had this cost me one penny, it would have been wasted.
__label__1 This is a great and very useful app.  I was on a business trip and in the room, the phone was on one side of the bed and the alarm clock on the other.  I had to unplug the alarm clock to charge my phone.  I was thinking...hmmm....I wonder if kindle has a
__label__1 This app is easy to use and customize. From the background colors to whether I want a special ring or song to wake me, it's got a lot to offer. Just used it for the first time today, and it works great on my GSIII. Going to download it now for my electro
__label__1 First of all, I love the fact that it has an alarm clock, timer, and (also free, but you order it separately), a stopwatch.The alarm clock is the best I've seen.  You have the option of having the alarm be a pre-installed alarm sounds, like multiple beep
__label__1 This app is easy to use and is very convenient for me. It is really really nice for a free app.
__label__1 This program works like an alarm clock just like it is supposed to. When the power goes out I will still be able to get up in time.
__label__1 I wanted a free alarm clock, and my son suggested this one.  It lets you use tones or playlists, and works even when the Kindle is turned off.  You have option for specific days of the week as well.  For example, I use my heavy metal playlist for when I 
__label__1 For a free app. this one does a great job reminding of what I input into the alarm clock. The clock works beautifully and the alarms are perfect (for me). I highly recommend this game.
__label__1 Easy to customize. Many options. Nap settings. Accurate. Extremely dependable I've used for years and has never let me down.
__label__1 I downloaded another alarm clock that was a FAOTD a while ago, and just uninstalled it because it NEVER went off. Thought maybe it was because I forgot to turn the sound on my Kindle up, but nope, the app just sucked.I got this one as a backup because I

__label__1 This app has tons of options.  Best alarm app I have tried so far including a paid one.  And this one is free!  I really like the math problems,  great idea.  But even the hardest ones are not TOO hard.  But then again I didn't expect calculus.  5*
__label__1 I just used this app. I have it set so it will ask me 2 math questions just to hit snooze! Good job Angle Labs, good job. LOL
__label__1 I really don't know what's going on with the people who make all these claims about how terrible this app is.  It doesn't enormously accelerate draining the battery.  It works perfectly on weekends.  It's intuitive and easy to use.  It works perfectly fo
__label__1 Had this installed before on another phone. I love it! Very easy to use and change! Adding new alarms is supper easy, and it will wake you up nice and easy. It works it's way from soft to loud, which I really like!.
__label__1 This app is AWSOME! In my opinion it's  not a battery draining app, because you can just turn it off( Not ALL the way off) and when the time comes for the alarm clock to go off it'll ring and you can hear it. If you have a passcode:type in pascode! z
__label__1 I enjoy that you have the ability to choose a harder way of dismissing your alarm before I used to sleep in much more than I do now and I also love how it tells you how much longer until it goes off that makes me be sure it will go off and I can track ho

__label__1 I was using my phone as an alarm, but this is much better. It allows me to set different alarm settings for different days and times, as my schedule changes from the weekdays to the weekends and holidays. Highly recommended!
__label__1 Sometimes I don't want to use my phone so I got this alarm for my Kindle and its great. I use it for many different things and it goes off no matter what I'm doing.
__label__1 There is nothing I detest more in the morning than a jarring, screeching alarm clock. I no longer have that problem and the memory of the awful awakening has almost faded to nothing thanks to this wonderful, gentle alarm clock. I love choosing a soft, ca
__label__1 I love this alarm clock. I can set it to be loud and impossible to ignore or set it to softly and gently awaken me. I usually choose the latter, but it's nice to have the annoying choice available. it never fails. I love it.

__label__1 I really needed an alarm app so I installed this one and it is absolutely amazing. You can customize it into your favorite color, make your own timer, and it is an amazing alarm. If I were you, I would install it.

__label__1 Works very well gently wakes you up. Download with confidence that it will always get you up on time. No complaints.
__label__1 You couldn't ask for a better alarm. I'm always happy going to sleep knowing I'll be waking up to this alarm. Honestly, there should be a paid version of this app. I would get it in a second.

__label__1 I especially like the ability to have the alarm sound begin at silence and increase to 100%.  I used to use my phone for my alarm.  I could not disable the alarm without deleting it, then it would have to set from scratch when I needed it again.  My hose
__label__1 I've been using this as my default alarm for months now. It's simple and it gets the job done. woot.

__label__1 You can set this to solve math problems to snooze and type in a password with many different characters (i.e. Ei3p90fvDDa) in which you'd have to be conscious to get through.
__label__1 This app works great for me, especially since I have a habit of hitting the snooze button repeatedly. You can create a playlist of songs to wake up to so it's not the same thing every day and the math function is fabulous for snoozers! Works great on Mot
__label__1 Once in a while I'll accidentally set my alarm for pm instead of am because it switches without me noticing but I don't suppose that's the apps fault. Best alarm clock app I've used on my kindle and will continue using for as long as I use my kindle for

__label__1 Easy to understand and use. However it would be nice to have more alarm clock sound to choose from.  Thanks.

__label__1 Works great, actually makes me get up to snooze. I used to sleep through all alarms. Having to do the math problems to snooze is awesome. Even though they aren't difficult you actually have to think and that wakes me up...

__label__1 I love waking up to my favorite songs (Attack on Titan, Hetalia, Bleach etc) and I love that it helps me get on up in time and not Falcon Punch the daylight's out of my kindle. The whole 'beep beep beep' of other alarm clocks just don't compare to waking
__label__1 These reviews are getting on my nerves. the app is great on the kindle just put it on standby and keep it plugged jeez. give it a rest.

__label__0 This ap did not work for me. I tried using it three different times, and all three times it was an epic fail! After alarm went off I tried to snooze it and it would not turn off.  I could not get it to stop.  I almost through my phone against the wall.  
__label__1 For real though. Those who created this product covered all bases including fun ways to wake up while making it user friendly. I think the name blows but who needs a good name when the product is just that good.
__label__1 Like the versatility. Multiple alarm tones and multiple alarms for just about any occasion. Would reccommend it to anyone. Loud enough for my spouse too. Like the options for sound volume.

__label__1 I love the alarm clock. It works very well.  I have a hard time with my old oneThis clock is so easy to use

__label__1 I have never seen a timer/alarm app with as many options as this one.  I use it every day to give me notices of something that is coming up on my calendar.  I especially like the feature that allows you to start the volume of an alarm low and raise it to

__label__1 I have used this for about a week now &amp; it is working great. recommended with no hesitation ; does what it is supposed to.
__label__1 This is so easy! All you do is set the alarm for as many days as you want and your done. Unlike normal alarms it doesn't go off at the same time every day so you won't accidentally wake up at 6:00am on Saturday morning! I definitely suggest you  get this
__label__1 I very much like this app. It is really easy to operate. The clock is large enough to see. It works GREAT! Also--it is FREE!
__label__1 This is a great app.  You can wake to any music you prefer--a different Mormon Tabernacle Choir song for each day or the same everyday.  You seem to be able to set as many as needed--get up, turn off facebook and get ready, stop reading email and get rea

__label__1 I use the music option for my alarm which is cool but the best feature imo us the widget which displays the next alarm time. this is awesome as I can quickly glance at my Ho.e screen and know if u have time for a snack or a powernap. Works great on my In

__label__1 I am fortunate to have no need for an alarm clock, but I use this on my Kindle Fire all the time. I set it to remind me of conference calls and appts as I often get caught up in what I am doing and forget to look at the clock. Initially, my biggest disap

__label__1 I love this. I had it before on my phone before it needed a complete wipe and had forfotten about it until recently. It is a much gentler way to wake up. Instead of jumping awake at the obnoxious built in alarm this sort of grabs your attention first and
__label__1 My regular alarm isn't loud enough. This will wake you up in no time. Will never be late or miss an appointment again.  I use this daily.
__label__1 I have to get up at different times every day' so finding an alarm that sets different times on different days and sets like that wi you don't have to set a new one us just good.__
__label__1 There are so many different alarm sounds from which to choose.  I don't worry about sleeping through the alarm anymore!
__label__1 I use this alarm clock instead of my bedside one now!!!  I really like that it's got a crescendo rather than just blaring at me.
__label__1 Normally a regular alarm will not wake me.  I can change the rings so I don't get used to the alarm sound.
__label__1 Works great and I can choose my own music to wake up to.  I have tried a few alarms and this one in my opinion is the best.
__label__1 The alarm on our clock radio stopped working and I needed a quick and easy substitute. I love how easy this is to set and that you can pick music from your Kindle/Cloud to play as the alarm. Highly recommended.
__label__1 An alarm clock shouldn't be that big of a deal and yet I've come to rely on my alarm clock app on my phone.  I just got my Kindle Fire HD and went looking for a suitable alarm clock app.  I picked the first one I found figuring they're all alike and then
__label__1 I use this every day.  The ability to "work math problems" as part of the snooze feature is a real plus.  Beats the heck out of my alarm clock.  I've tried a few other alarm clock apps but keep coming back to this.  (It is on my Kindle Fire.)

__label__1 Awesome app !!! Good variety of sounds, could use a couple nature sounds maybe. Didn't think it would work, pleasantly surprised.
