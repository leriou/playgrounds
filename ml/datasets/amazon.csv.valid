__label__1 This app is amazing ....everything can be customized to you.... look, feel, dimness, music, buzzer, snooze time+ amount of snoozes aloud and Evan how you dismiss the alarm (shaking or math problems etc.)
__label__0 Had to do a full recovery with kindle support. Locked it up, no chartering no nothing...very UN pleased with this one
__label__1 I love the fact that I can have several alarms to set . You can set one  for weekdays and another for weekends. I also need one to let me know it's time for medication. I use to have a couple of alarm clocks for this, now it is all in one place and on on
__label__1 I had to find an alarm-clock app because I am evidently too dumb to figure out the complicated alarm settings on my new projection alarm clock.  I downloaded this app late one night and was able to set it correctly in a matter of seconds.  What a refresh
__label__1 What can I say. This wakes me up every day!! I love it and glad I got it. Great app and it is easy to use.
__label__1 Highly functional easy to use program.  You can set recurring alarms with it, like what time your class ends every Monday, and you can also use it as a timer to time &#34;boil for ten minutes,&#34; or you can set a one time alarm to remind you of an appo
__label__1 I love this app! Very customizable with sooooo many options. Great selection of sounds to choose from, and so many other features, far too many to list. I plan to research this developer and see what else they have created! Kudos to the developers!! Than

__label__1 I don't like early mornings or alarm clocks, but this app works well for me. The fade in is great!
__label__0 It worked as promised a few times, but now there's no sound when the alarm goes off. Yes, I checked all the settings. Bummer. Kept trying different settings and times for over a month. I really wanted to like this app!
__label__1 I use this daily rather than my old alarm clock. I absolutely love it. Plus, it was free. I like how the alarm starts quiet and grows louder.
__label__1 This works great for my Kindle Fire.  As soon as I finish reading at night, I just set my clock and it wakes me in the morning.  Kindle is not just for reading anymore ;-)
__label__1 it is great wakes you up I am never late to school. it os easy to snooze. it is not bad at all.
__label__1 I use this every morning and it never fails me. Love it!Choices of music and gets louder if you don't wake up.

__label__1 Seems to work just fine. Have only used it a few times so can't give any details yet about any idiosyncracies in the app. If I learn more later I will update this review.
__label__1 I love this Alarm Clock! As far as I can tell my Kindle Fire doesn't have an alarm, so this is what I use to wake myself up. I like the way it looks, I like the easy options and the sounds to wake up to. One of the best purchases I've boughten, I'm one v
__label__1 It&apos;s the most effective alarm clock I&apos;ve ever had, and it&apos;s free! Trying to figure out what 23 minus 7 is is easy during the day, but trying to make the stupid freaking alarm shut up when you&apos;re still half asleep and why in the $&amp;
__label__1 I like this app. its ringtone is better than my own alarm which has an annoying sound. highly recommended. I'm 12 years old!
__label__1 Unlimited alarm settings is most helpful. If I miss an appointment, it's because I didn't set an alarm. Great app.
__label__1 I have so many alarms, you would think I was apart of the  fire department.  This one has never let me down...
__label__0 This was my first attempt to find an alarm that would give me options on the 'rings'.  I really DO NOT like the choices on the Kindle.  (Sorry to admit because I love my Kindle!) ....  But this had the very same sounds and no other attractive options to 
__label__1 I use this as my regular alarm clock. I like the ringers for it and I like how I can set several different alarms for to go off on different days. It appears to be intended for use on a phone but I use it on the Kindle Fire and really like it.
__label__1 Good free app for my Kindle Fire. Easy to use if you just want something to let you know when to get up. You can set several alarms. Not annoying. I set mine to start with a soft sound and gradually get louder. Works great!
__label__1 I love this alarm app. I have various settings for different days and hours to awake. The early morning alarm for weekdays is the Rooster crowing. It gets louder until I wake up and either dismiss it, or snooze the alarm. The second line of defense is to
__label__1 This alarm clock app helps me wake up early in the morning before every one else here at our beach house. (We only stay 1 week a year :'( ) So then I have time to get ready, make some anklets, work out, read a book, and watch T.V. I haven't noticed any p
__label__1 I love the flexibility of the alarm.  Works well on my kindle.  I love the use pf math problems. to wake and/or interrupt &amp; prompt me to go to sleep.  Great app.  Can't speak to how much it drains battery.
__label__1 this is a great alarm clock. in the summer we have storms and lightening electric alarm clocks get hit and with this is my best alarm.
__label__1 I download this app and then when i went to school, I was sitting and it thought I was sleeping and rung and the teacher was like give me it, and I had to kill her so she don't, then aliens came and I made a band then stole the statue of liberty and am n
__label__1 I'm not understanding the reviews for the kindle fire. I have been using  this app since the summer and it works perfectly. I love it you get to choose your own song to wake you up or choose what ever sound thats on your device. Compatible with the youtu
__label__1 This app provides an option to make me do math, before allowing me to hit snooze, much less dismiss the alarm. So, not only is my brain being forced to wake up, just to turn the alarm off, but my mental math skills are improving! I am very happy with thi
__label__1 I use this often.  It's quite and gradually gets louder and louder.  Work great on my Kindle!  It's a keeper!
__label__1 Finally, a free alarm clock that does everything I want it to... This app has so many different ways to wake you up and I love it. LOVE THIS APP!

__label__1 GREAT ALARM CLOCK.  I USE IT FOR WORK EVERY MORNING.  I THINK THE ALARM CLOCK IS WELL DONE AND I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT.
__label__1 I have only used this a couple of times. Read the reveiw and since I do not always have my kindle plugged in, was concerned that it might drain the battery. I haven't noticed that being a problem. It might be useful to know though, that if you have somet
__label__1 I have used this app a few times now. The app is nice and loud and will not stop until i stop the alarm myself. Get this app you will not be dissapointed..
__label__0 the software is not much different than the regular standard alarm clock. definitely not worth paid 4. this is about the best alarm clock application. it is however very standard.
__label__1 I absolutely LOVE this app.  I've been using it for sometime now and I really love the way it wakes me up slowly rather then the shell shock out of bed sort. lol  I highly recommend it.
__label__1 I've had clock apps in the past that have failed me as far as the alarm goes. This one not only woke me up on time, but it worked even though my Kindle cover was closed! I love it!
__label__1 I love this app.  I have pre-set my daily alarm time and it hasn't failed me yet.  I also enjoy getting to choose what sound I want to use.  It also allows me 10 minute snoozes.  It is very easy to set the alarm time.  Set and forget.  I keep my Fire plu
__label__1 repeats and uses the same approach as my phone does. could be louder but since kindle does not over heat it can lay under or next to my pillow.
__label__1 Yeah, it's not saying much, but the app is very good, has a ton of time-related gizmos outside of the alarm itself and it's freaking free. It's a must have, whether you need a new alarm clock, travel or want to increase the Kindle Fire's functionality.
__label__1 easy to set, nice ring tone, works. (doesn't have clock face that I know of, it has a digital readout. you should test drive it)
__label__0 When I got this it was awesome. but... after a month it quite working and I was late for school etc.
__label__1 If you need a free alarm clock, this is it. Easy to use, great features, and it's free!!! This was the first app I put on my Kindle!
__label__1 I can't believe this is free! It's great! There are a bunch of options for snooze and dismiss. Great alarm clock! And I haven't had any glitches!
__label__1 It is an awesome app. It has so many options customization, and tools that easily make it the best app of its kind.
__label__1 This is the second phone I've this app on and I love it!  It has everything I need and much much more!
__label__1 Works great. Replaced other alarm clock app with this one. I have had no problems with this app. It has been very reliable. :-)
__label__1 One day I messed up my phone @ work..so I had to buy a cheap phone to get me by for the month..anyways my cheap phone didn't have the simplest thing..such as an alarm clock. I browsed through my kindle looking for a simple alarm clock and found this one.
__label__1 Alarm Clock Xtreme is a great app.Easy to use and has all the features I could ask for.Highly recommended.
__label__1 I used to always turn my alarm off after a few snoozes thinking I would get up. Several times I fell back asleep, and was very late for work. With this alarm you can elect to solve math problems before you completely turn off the alarm. I love this! Have
__label__1 Works  GREAT!!!  I have used it for medical reasons, especially when I had to take medicine several times during a night  (every 4 hours) for a short time.  I could set several times at once.  Also good for travelling - I depend just like my phone.  In f
__label__1 I use this app every morning as my alarm and it's wonderful!  Highly recommend..you will not be disappointed.  Very happy customer.
__label__0 I'll look in my downloads area of my Kindle. So if I can't find it then obviously I can't rate it. LOL
__label__1 I really like this app. I am able to set several different alarms and can select to wake to the music I have saved on my Kindle Fire.
__label__1 This works great on my kindle fire! I love it. I can set my alarm to go off with my music. I like how it starts out really soft, then gets louder. You can set multiple alarms at the same time, and there's even a timer too. It doesn't drain my battery at 
__label__1 This clock is super loud and super easy to use. I would recommend to anyone who has trouble waking up

__label__1 Works perfectly! Love picking a random song to wake up to! Would recommend to anyone who is looking for a great alarm clock!
__label__1 I never here alarm clocks.  This one does the trick; I never have to reset after the power goes out.  It works... buff said.
__label__1 I really love this app. it allows you to set it so it goes off to songs you own! it is so cool. I've never actually tried it without it being plugged in, because I charge my kindle while I sleep, so maybe what the reviews that talked about it draining ba
__label__1 I wake up to it!  It was simple to download and simple to set different alarms for different days. It was a nice back-up alarm when my clock died.
__label__1 this clock app works well for timing how long my children read to a travel alarm.  I'd recommend it for anyone.
__label__1 It is my only alarm clock.  Love waking up to my playlist.  Easy to use, unlike an iHome product on which I wasted my money.
__label__1 I have had alot of alarm apps...and there were a couple of times they didnt go off...but this alarm ALWAYS goes off! i love it, there are fun ways to set snooze such as shaking the device and even solving math problems...it is a MUST get..enjoy:)

__label__1 Does what it says it does.  Lots of options.  We use this on both our kindle fires.  I do recommend this.
__label__1 I love this app! I have had trouble waking up for...well, forever. This alarm has an option (set as default) to wake you gently with a gradual increase in volume. Add to that the giant snooze button and smaller dismiss button, the option to do math probl
__label__1 Great app. Keeps me on point. I never miss anything I need to do having this on my Kindle. And it's free! Thanks!
__label__1 This app is the best! I would never wake up before but since I got the app I wake up every morning and I love the math method for the snooze. Highly recommended.
__label__1 I use this alarm almost everyday. its loud and I like it has many different ringtone options. don't miss out on this FREE app
__label__1 This is an excellent alarm clock.  I had originally purchased one that was $1.99, but it only worked one day.  This one works each and every day....I actually use it as a back up to my regular alarm clock just in case there is a power loss.  (So much for
__label__1 Easy to use and many great features make this a must have app.  I highly recommend it.  There are so many options to customize how you wake up.  I especially like the feature that resets the alarm automatically but allows you to select what days of the w

__label__1 I found this app under the free app of the day. it has been extremely useful for my iiregular schedule so I am not constantly resetting a traditional alarm clock. it is very easy to use.
__label__1 This is hands down my favorite app I have on my Kindle fire.  The alarm clock has taken the place of my cell phone one and my real one on my night stand.  It is super easy to use.  My favorite things about the app are how you have many alarm sound option
__label__1 This app is really useful and easy to use. I use it every morning! you get to customize the sound and really everything else!
__label__1 I haven't tried some of the other alarm apps out there because I don't need to. This app has everything you could want. It even lets you use your own music to wake your self up! I love it.
__label__1 this alarm clock really does work. I thought at first I would not be able to hear the alarm but it was loud enough.  I was using my cell as my alarm clock and I now I can turn off my cell and not get any phone calls when I am trying to sleep
__label__1 Love the fade-in option. App is very customizable. This is one of the first alarms I ever installed, I paid for it and I won't ever have a need to replace it with anything else.
__label__1 A workhorse. Love the stardard alarm sound choices. Caffeinated rattlesnake rocks!!! I really wish reviews were character - count based....
__label__1 This is an awesome free app! I like it because it doesn't scare the heebie jeebies out of you when it goes off. It starts off low and slowly gets louder. There are a ton of options you can choose from, i.e. the size of the snooze button; what music you p
__label__1 Easy to use and if you have to wake up this is a good way to do it. Love the declining snooze and small dismiss button.
__label__1 My children get out of school at one time 4 days a week, but a different time 1 day a week. Also, one child takes viola after school 2 days a week and the other child does taekwondo at various times on various different days. I'd often find myself runnin

__label__1 Works great - easy to set up and can have multiple alarms going at the same time.  I also love that it overrides the volume button, so it doesn't matter if I've turned off the sound, the alarm goes off anyway (just make sure you don't leave headphones pl

__label__1 This app works great.  I set multiple alarms and label them.  I have never had any problems with this app.
__label__1 I like having the option to calmly waking to 1D singing to me or hearing the Yeah Yeah Yeahs to really motivate me.  Great app!
__label__1 Use your own music if you want, even a different selection for different times or days.  Set it up to whatever days and times you want and never worry if your alarm is set again if you like.  So many ways to customize this app that you will wonder how yo
__label__1 By far the best, and easiest alarm clock app to use.  I have tried all of the other free ones only to have them either not go off or crash.  This one has always worked flawlessly.  The developer actually listens to the users when they have a problem and 
__label__1 This little app wakes me up every day.  I've abandoned my old clock radio.  I have it installed on my cell phone and  Kindle Fire.  It's especially helpful when traveling.  I don't have to figure out the alarm in the hotel room, and it removes worrying w
__label__1 This, I think by far... is the best alarm clock app. You can TOTALLY make it your own digital alarm clock, from ringtones, button fixes, sound and display, and even if you're on a schedule for work, you can change the settings to repeat, where as in my c
__label__1 There are a ton of sound options for this alarm program, most of which I'm sure people would never consider but it's fun to go through them and laugh at the possibility of waking up to some of the noises.  There are many good options as well, 5-stars.-D
__label__1 Really nice alarm clock app, great features, very customizable. I've used it for several months now and it has met every need.  I particularly love how you can fade in the sound or music, no more being startled awake (you can even set the length of the f
__label__1 nothing you don't need. everything you do. ads are there. but don't get in way. i like the increasing volume feature.
__label__1 Great Alarm!!! I like where you can change the color theme. It gradually gets loud and doesn't shock you awake. The snooze is great as well. I have it set for 10 minutes. And it's FREE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :)

__label__1 Why not get one app that does both work as a timer s well as a super alarm? I like the variety of sounds as well as the ease of operation. Five stars!
__label__1 Works. Sound volume seems fine; limited only by the volume of kindle fire.  Starts off low volume and slowly increaseses so as to wake you in a more natural manner than a suddenly blaring alarm.
__label__1 This app is definitely worth the download.  It wakes me up and even allows me to fall back asleep. I'm on time for appointments no matter how late I fall asleep. Thanks.
__label__1 I've tested several alarm clocks for my Kindle Fire HD but this is the best.It's packed with features and comes with a lot of preloaded sounds.Some are named after constellations which I like as a stargazer.And they are loud enough to wake the dead.
__label__1 hay is a really good app try it and u will love it u can but your own song to wake u up and u can change the min really good app try it
__label__1 Its simple and it does what it is supposed to do. Easy to add your own music as your alarm. I love the timer feature...great for cooking or setting limits on my kid's use of the kindle.
__label__1 I use the alarms all the time.  Not just to wake up each morning, but also as reminders about specific tasks. My 4 year old hears it and knows what's coming up because of the ringtone. So many tones to choose from. I also love all the different settings 
__label__1 This is a good app if you dont have an alarm clock...i used this when i had to wake me up in the morning.You pick the alarms sound,volume,and everything that suits you!
__label__0 this alarm clock doesn't even work and there's no ring when you set it and i didn't know how to make it work.
__label__1 I have this on both my phone and kindle. I recommended it and installed it on my brother and mother's kindles as well. It is easy to use, easy to set the time and easy to snooze or shut off.
__label__1 Very reliable and easy to use. I rely on it every day.  Good job!I am running it on a standard Kindle Fire.
__label__1 This is a fully functional, easy to use alarm clock with a timer and a stopwatch.  My favorite feature is that when the alarm goes off, it starts very soft and gradually gets louder.  So much nicer than being blasted awake!  I have no need for other alar

__label__1 There isn't anything I don't like about this app. I would highly recommend it to anyone. Give it a try!
__label__1 I got this for my Kindle Fire and it works perfectly. I use the music on my Kindle instead of a regular alarm or ringtone, and it can get pretty loud. It does run in the background after you set an alarm, so I recommend setting it before you sleep and ke
__label__1 Outstanding app. One of my favorites: very customizable, intuitive, easy to use. love the 'shake to snooze' feature!!  Ads aren't overly intrusive.  Great product.
__label__1 Nice alarm. Good luck sleeping through the rooster tone. Several tones to choose from. Several alarms can be set at the same time. You can set it to ring/Buzz/whatever just one time. Every weekday, every Wednesday(or Friday or whatever you want). Very ha
__label__1 This is the perfect alarm clock for me.  Since I read myself to sleep each night I always have my Kindle Fire next to me.  Adding the app made perfect sense.  I like that I can select from so many ring-tones as my wake up sound and I love that I can set 
__label__1 This app works well for me.  It is dependable and does everything I wanted it to do: wake me up.
__label__1 With my busy scheduale I have to be up at 5;40 AM each morning. Being my age (14), and having to wake up at this time is so hard and I have to say that the normal Heep's do nothing but temporarily wake me up. Thisnon.the other hand is easy to use and mak
__label__1 All the features I need and a seemingly limitless number of alarms permitted.  I like that I can choose a specific song as the alarm sound or have the app choose at random from my music library.  Very complete app with no negatives for me.  I highly reco
__label__1 I downloaded this due to I was having phone problems and needed a back up alarm clock. It goes off ontime whether the Kindle is on silent or off.
__label__1 I really like this app. I have a question though, I received a notice of an update. How do I get it?
__label__1 This is such a terrific application! I have a choice of varied pre-sets that are pleasant to the ear or my fav music selection. The single best concept here is the ability to have the alarm start off quietly and gradually increase in volume. And no limit
__label__1 This is an excellent app.  It works well and easy to use.  The format was well thought out.  I have not found any features I would like to have that were not there. ,

__label__1 This is the best clock app I have used with tons of features like different ring tones. setting ringer volume separate from other on my kindle, volume crescendo which starts out soft and gradually gets louder so its not obnoxious and more! I cant believe
__label__1 This app is really great, it has all the accommodations that a good alarm needs. Works great for Kindle Fire and if you have music you can listen to that when you wake up. You should totally get it because if you don't a little girl named Sarah will show
__label__1 this is a great app and u can adjust the volume of the alarms so they don't freak u out! I recommend this app for Kindle Fire.
__label__1 Use this alarm clock all the time on my kindle.  Great reminder and extremely handy when you're busy doing other things and lose track of time.
__label__1 I really like this app as I use it when I have to be somewhere and I am looking up things on the web.  Keeps track of the time.
__label__1 I am an extremely heavy sleeper.  I already had an alarm clock app that showed the weather as well on my kindle, but it limited me to only three alarms.  Yes, I do need more than 3 alarms that wake up, even if they go off in succession.  This alarm clock
__label__1 I love this app... it is so amazing it has woken me up everyday for the last 6monthes failing only once.... and that is helpful because I'm a heavy sleeper.....
__label__1 Very easy to set up and it is highly customizible. The alarm is loud and can be set to rise gradually. Alarm can be set for different days all at once.
__label__1 I am a very heavy sleeper and this is the only alarm that wakes me up. I also love the gradually getting louder so it doesn't burst my eardrums. so handy I love it
__label__1 My husband and I live by this alarm app! It's the best alarm we've found that actually wakes us up. Lol! We especially like the Rooster Alarm! Lol!
__label__1 This really is a good app. It has an alarm and and a timer sort of thing. It has never failed me in the mornings when I have to get up. It works great and is totally worth getting!
__label__1 This is a great free application. I use it as a secondary alarm, and it has never failed. I also use this as a travel alarm.
__label__1 Another very easy to set alarm clock for my Kindle (Why should I have to wake up early if I'm on vacation - other than to hit the Continental Breakfast Bar and to get an early start on the day?) but it works great.
__label__1 Alarm Clock Xtreme Free is a great little tool to have on my Kindle Fire. There are pleanty of sounds to choose from, and I like that it starts out softly and persistantly increases volume till you wake up. The timer numbers are large enough that I can s

__label__1 Terrific app! I thought I might use it for travel or as a nap alarm, but there are so many cool features that it's already replaced my real alarm clock.  I'm a chronic snooze-abuser, so the snooze features are perfect for me.
__label__1 I highly recommend Alarm Clock Xtreme Free because it allows the user to setup multiple alarms, and the user also gets to select to wake up to either an alarm sound or a song of their choice.  This app is worth it!
__label__0 I cant have this without it freezing and I cant turn it off it has a stupid virese It doesn't even sack me up( .)( .)n
__label__1 Love this alarm clock app.. love the different sound choices and volume selector too... also has snooze function too =)
__label__1 Without this app, I would be hitting the snooze button and being late everyday.  Very simple interface and good amount of personalization
__label__1 This is perfect. It has options that allow me to keep track of every activity for the whole family. It allows for all the variations for repeats that I need. I usually don't write reviews but this one is so worth the effort. I really love all the options
__label__1 I love that I can use my own music and ssounds for waking up, and set as many as I need. I wake up at varying times, depending on the day and Ned a different sound for each. this app is reliable and able to accommodate my desire for waking to my meditati
__label__1 Exactly what I was looking for, ease of use, no messy/complicated app to download.  Use this on my Kindle Fire for when I'm just reading and taking a bit of a nap with the baby.  It is loud enough for me to hear it but not too loud to disturb the baby.  
__label__1 clock works great, is nice and loud to take you up from the deepest of sleeps, easy features to customize your alarms!
__label__1 Works well. No crashes. I like how you can use personal music as they wake up. Like the options such as decreasing snooze time.
__label__1 This is a great app.  You can set several different alarms for different days all at once.  It allows you to slowing increase the volume as the alarms rings.  It also has a great feature that allows you to simply shake your phone to shut off the alarm.  
__label__1 I use this app as an alarm clock when I need to wake up to be on time for appointments. It's very user friendly.
__label__1 I have tried many alarm clocks where you can just hit snooze only for it not to go off again. This one makes you open you eyes to see the off button otherwise it just keeps going
__label__0 it is so bad. I truned the volume all the way up and I could not here it. I am not60when I cant hear things but man this app sucks.
__label__1 Works as described. Love it would recommend to everyone that needs reminded of things to take care of at certain times of the day and the week. Great app thank you amazon, for this free gadget! I always look to see other reviews on products worth purchas
__label__0 Does not work how it says it will.Not worth the time or space for download.I do not recommend this app.
__label__1 The Setup is pretty basic you can pick the alarm sound, or name the alarm you're setting up , put the alarm on repetitive days, change the way the soundis executed etc. etc..This is a very handy app ..I usually hide my kindle so that I have no choice but
__label__1 This app was just what i needed. I have had 6 different alarm functions going at once, I dont know what the max is. I can set each alarm for a a seperate day(s) auto snooze or dismiss or neither, choose from many different alarms that are built in. I hav
__label__1 does everything i wanted it too. i use it almost everyday as an alarm. would recommend to anyone looking for one.
__label__1 ~All this app stuff is new &amp; confusing to me, this was the first app I got that was easy to use.I don't understand why most apps are more confusing than they need to be.
__label__1 I wish I had downloaded this a long time ago. Easy to set gentle noises or loud. The gradual alarm is awesome. Two thumbs up.
__label__1 Great app. It does what says. It is easy to use and configurable to do everything you need it to do.
__label__1 I thing it's great and absolutely perfect! I regomend it to everybody who has to get up at a certain time.
__label__1 I have been using this app for a couple of months and I love it. It is so easy to set alarms and have your music or lots of other sounds wake . You up. And is so easy to turn off or hit snooze.  GREAT. GREAT
__label__1 I used this app this morning to awake me at 5:45-not my usual time by any means. I set it to rooster crow and it was plenty loud even woke up the kids down the hall. will use this all the time
__label__1 I love the fact that I can have my phone on silent and the alarm clock work with sound. I have a different alarm app that I paid for and it doesn't do close to the amount of things this app can do. I can customize it to play my own music for the alarm cl
__label__1 Great. app.  Able to change sound, method of turning off alarm. I use it as backup to my regular alarm.
__label__0 runs on the fire but you can't hear the alarm mostly the fire's fault.  a Also the. clock display (digital) is a waste of the available real estate.
__label__1 This wakes me everyday . And I have to get up at 3am. I check it every night and plug in my kindle and no prob.
__label__1 This app may be a free alarm clock, but it's not like others. This alarm has different settings to help wake you such as doing math problems of different difficulties to the selection of an alarm that you can get music from you device on the kindle, not 
__label__1 I love this app...it works great and one thing I love about it ...is that when u set an alarm it tells u how long u have till it goes off!
__label__1 If you need an alarm this is the app! I use this every day to wake up to school... this app prevents me from going back to sleep... i definitely would recommend this app
__label__1 I absolutely love this app!! The volume increases in up to 60 seconds. You can choose your alarms noise, and the snooze features!! This is a great app, you defiantly should install it!!!
__label__1 Love this free alarm clock app!  There are a lot of different alarm sounds to choose from; can choose to snooze or not to snooze; can set alarms for different days and/or times and each one can have a differt sounding alert, including music.  It loaded w
__label__1 This is a great app for free. I was surprised with the ability of customizing it; right down to the fade in alarm, so that you are not frightened awake. It does have advertisements, but I have not had any problems with that. I have this and a paid for al
__label__1 It's amazing, but a 1 suggestion for extra personalization:1. You could add the ability to display pictures as a background.Also, to really give an awesome alarm, the downloader should also get the FreeDI youtube downloader. Download music by going to yo
__label__1 wonderful alarm clock w/ great options!  I have mine set to start quietly and gradually get louder -nice sound options that are not annoying or abrupt.  Also has the option to wake up to a Pandora playlist (which I just noticed and have not used yet)  ha
__label__1 I have been using this as my morning wake up alarm since I purchased my Kindle fire and it has worked very well.
__label__1 I love being able to set multiple alarms in the morning simply because I tend to not wake up at the first one. I paired it with the InkPad Notepad (for notes) so I can alarm myself to see the notes to make sure I do what I typed out.
__label__1 I can sleep through just about anything...except this very loud alarm. Easy to use, have multiple alarms for set days of the week, programmable snooze duration, customizable ringers and more!
__label__1 I love t it has always be here you should even raise the price I mean it's free at least 99 cent  cause this is needed to.wake you up and all the selections you v you get is wonderful-Jojo
__label__1 I use this alarm for waking, medicine reminders and more.  The many different settings and multiple alarm set up is why.  Setting music as the alarm sound would be a bonus.
__label__1 I use this app to get up for school every day,  and it is great. its very customizable and a great tool to have. To anyone looking for an alarm app, the search ends here.
__label__1 Feature packed app, yet very easy to use. Really like that you can select music for the ringers including the timer feature. The organization of the main screen is also well done.
__label__1 I love this!  As so many people have pointed out, it really works -- as long as you only need to set alarms for one day.  I guess the paid version gives you more options, but this really works.  I especially love it for times when I have to be at a certa
__label__1 I have the free version and this is a great app for my Kindle Fire.  I use it every day!
__label__1 I have been using this app for a year on my kindle and I love it. You can set and save several different alarms, all with different settings.
__label__1 Thank you AVG Labs as this app works as stated which is excellent.  The option of utilizing your own music is a major bonus that sets this app apart from the other alarm apps.  This is a great alarm app.
__label__1 Free super easy to customize app for those who engage in timefoolery-- setting the alarm early so you can purposely enjoy the extra time snoozing. Hit the snooze with a tap or solve increasingly difficult math problems to wake your brain up. Adjust the C
__label__0 Didn't work for me on multiple levels.  I uninstalled it within about an hour and went looking for another "reminder" system that would meet my needs.  Not worth the effort from over here in my world.
__label__1 This is by far the best alarm clock. I love the way it wake me up gently with my music. The music goes from soft to louder so that it doesn't jar you awake. Love it!
__label__1 I was disappointed in an alarm clock I downloaded before this.. that was intricate, but I couldn't figure out how to turn off the alarm..This one is a lot simpler and forgoes the fancy clock display, but makes up for that 10 times in useability.  The set
__label__1 There are so many features and options here I can't believe it's a free app. Replaced the phone's stock alarm &amp; my actual alarm clock. Best feature is probably the progressive volume.
__label__1 Nice app that does what it says it will do. Easy to navigate and setup. I use it over the alarm app on my phone.
__label__1 Usually people hate their alarm clocks, but this one is so easy to use!  And has many many different alarms, my favorite is safari and world.
__label__1 this is the best alarm clock app you will find. a huge plus is that it is free. the ads are small and unnoticed while the alarms are loud and clear. great app.
__label__1 This is a very very good app to buy......... plus it Is FREE so get your alarm clock extreme right away
__label__1 nice app....gives you options if you need them but not so many that its confusing. replaced the stock alarm on my HTC thunderbolt, feels like the developer looked st the pros and cons of every other app and fixed all of them.
__label__1 UPDATED 4-20-14I've had this app for about a year and a half and it never lets me down.  I stand by it 100%!The most important feature I was looking for was AUTO-SNOOZE and this has it!  You don't have to touch your phone if you don't want to deal with t
__label__1 I love this app, and whenever I'm at a camp, I use it to wake myself up. Even my cousin said it was awesome, and she's Mel B from America's got Talent!
__label__1 This alarm clock is so helpful because of its great ability at waking me up whenever i need to! I can wake up to the radio, my favorite song, or one of the provided alarms you can choose from. I also like that you can make an alarm repeat whenever you ne
__label__1 This app works great. I love it. I truly depend on it. Free version is awesome! I would recommend this to everyone.
__label__1 Handy free app that hasn't failed me yet! Absurdly easy to set your wake time with the option of solving a math problem to be able to either turn off the alarm or hit the snooze button. Either way you have to actually open your eyes...  also comes with s
__label__1 I have a really difficult time waking up except to this alarm. I love that I can shake it to snooze instead of trying to see the snooze button. Excellent alarm. Best I've ever had!
__label__1 excellent app. many options to fit your exact needs. one day. every other day, or custom days. able to pick your own wake up sounds on kindle is a deinite must.
__label__1 I love the setting to 'do a math problem' in order to snooze or turn off. ;) Great app! I like the gradual sound of the alarm going off compared to my cell phone ;)
__label__1 I found this Alarm Clock Xtreme app awhile ago and loved it.  I install this on all the Android tablets and smartphones I get.  This has more customizable options than the stock alarm app in Android.  I like the fade in option for the alarms where the al
__label__1 Great app and simple to use.I wake up every morning with this alarm.  I love that it increases in volume to wake me without scaring me.
__label__1 Which is jus what I need in order to actually get up.most alarms I can sleep through but not this one
__label__1 this alarm clock is great .. I was wasn't. sure I was going to like it at first that it wasn't. going to be loud. enough but it is a lot of people. are saying that. it drains. your battery but I keep my kindle plugged in at night so I don't have to worry
__label__1 Nice app I lime the ability to use downloaded music as an alarm. I also am very pleased with the alarm that increases in volume.
__label__1 if u want a free alarm clock than u should get this. it wakes me up every morning. it is the best
__label__1 THIS CLOCK ALARM APP HAS PROVEN TO BE VERY ALARMING! THE SOUND IS VERY CLEAR AND DISTINCT AND IT WILL GET YOUR ATTENTION. IT IS NICE TO KNOW YOU HAVE AN ITEM THAT WILL TRULY GET YOU GOING!
__label__1 This is a decent alarm clock function. The feature I like the best is that the alarm isn't jarring. The alarm starts out low and gets progressively louder. This is much better than any other alarm I've had. They usually rip me out of sleep. This one wake
__label__1 I love how you can choose music that you have on you device. I set mine to my favorite song. I also love how you can disable snooze. I need mine disabled to ensure that I get out of bed. I also love how you can just choose an artist and it plays a random

__label__1 I love this. Its very helpful to a forgetful person like me. You can set an alarm up for any time. You have so many options of ring tones and you can choose your own music. It has a stop watch too. You can make it any of your favorite shades.
__label__1 This is an awesome alarm clock! It wakes me up every time, and doesn't wake anyone else up, so it's not an issue. Really great!
__label__1 I like multiple wake up setting ... I have several different times set and all I need to do to pick one is select a checkbox.  It has separate features for each alarm.  I like the snooze feature, and the fact that I can set it beyond the 9 minutes of my 
__label__0 I downloaded this app and a minute later I deleted it.  It just wasn't what I was looking for.  It didn't have the alarm features I needed or the look I wanted.
__label__1 I've been using this alarm app now for 3 months , it works great , it allows you to set 3 different alarms , you can set it to your music and it gets loud as the minutes go on , it has a huge snooze button , can't miss it , I recommend this app
__label__1 I love that I can use my Kindle music as ringer and can set multiple alarms. I wish it came with more variety of presets though.
__label__1 I've had this for some time. I used it for a alarm clock. It works well. If you need a free alarm clock this one works great.
__label__1 Excellent app!  Completely customizable.  You can set the time, the length of snooze, the tone, and the volume.  Love it.....Vitad
__label__1 This is one of the best alarm clocks I've ever used. Since it's on my Kindle, I'm not willing to throw it across the room like I would a cheap $10 alarm clock. It's also not small enough to fall under the bed, like my cellphone would. The alarm noises ar
__label__1 this clock is perfect for my every day routine. it wakes me up for school and warns me when my battery might die this app is just so amazing I recommend it to anyone with a busy schedule
__label__1 I've been using daily for weeks for waking to my own tunes my way. love this app on EVO 3d
__label__1 I have only had this a few days but so far it has worked great. I am a person who will hit snooze or dismiss and go back to sleep usually, not with the math feature on this app. I have it set to 5 problems of medium difficulty which is adding and subtrac
__label__1 This is a great alarm clock!  I can turn the volume all the way down while I play PVZ at bedtime and I don't have to worry that the alarm won't wake me up if I forget to turn the volume back up!  It is very reliable. I would recommend it to anyone who do
__label__1 it wakes me up every morning so I can get what I need done on time without being late. it works so get this app.
__label__1 The speaker on my old LG Ally (which was my alarm clock prior to iPhone) crapped out, so I needed to download an app quickly for my Kindle Fire while I was shopping for a new phone.  This is simple, easy to program, and works identically to the Android a
__label__1 I really needed a free alarm clock, but the good ones cost money, but the horrible ones were free. I saw this as free app of the day and it was just what I needed. This one is loud enough to wake me up every morning. (The clock included with the kindle c
__label__1 I have used this alarm clock for almost two years now and rely on it to get up for school in the morning. It has a useful timer and is very easy to use. I strongly recommend using this app.
__label__1 I'm just sad that the option to play random song by artist broke on my phone when i upgraded my Atrix 2 to icecream sandwich.  I still use the alarm every day.  I get waken up and practice in my math skills.
__label__1 a great ap! does everything you would want an alarm clock to do! I would reccomend it highly to everyone! it can also be customized.
__label__1 I have been using this app for at least 6 months. This program has satisfied me ever since. I consider about the flexibility. We can both use the available tones, which I barely use, and our own music. I think the useful point of this app is the amount o
__label__0 I've tried to use this several times.  But it has never woken me up.  This one is a waste of time.
__label__1 I really like it does what its supposed to do never had any problems. I'm sure it has other good features but I just use the alarm
__label__1 This app met all my expectations and then some. Choosing music to play as the alarm, randoming the songs if you want, and even volume ramp up. Then there is the adjusting snooze function. Love this app!
__label__1 Ever since I downloaded this app I haven't Been late for school. I go to a Catholic school so their really strict. Good job creator!  P.S I love Harry Styles &lt;3 #directioner
__label__1 use this alarm every night. it only drains your kindles battery down about 2% each night. definitely deserves the 5 stars.
__label__0 As the title said, the app force closed on page 12 all the time. Tried on 3 Verizon Thunderbolt devices and same thing.
__label__0 I wanted to sort my Kindle books. I bought this because I thought it would work on my tablet.  Amazon's Shelfari won't work on my Samsung device.
__label__0 I downloaded this on my sisters tablet thinking that it was the lateset version.  She  needs to be able to highlight.  It does nothing more than the free version!  This is a rip off.  Either give me an update to the new 2.2.0 version or give me a refund!
__label__1 I love the highlight function. I use this to study and highlight my answers, I love that it remembers where I was unlike Adobe which starts you at the beginning of the book. Awesome APP!
__label__1 This progam is able to use ( Adobe Text Doc and epup ) so no matter what I download from there or any other book store I use it. It also put the book in order or how ever I set it up in seetings.yes I would recomen this reader to my friends.
__label__1 Worked good on my Pandigital 9 inch Slate Droid Running Android 2.0.Problem is that it uses 6 or 7 Meg of memory and I removed it so I could install other Apps. Am looking for a lighter E-reader.I may reload this if I decide to dedicate my device to stri
__label__1 I use epub a lot and it works great for that.recomended for all needing a good reader. Try it now.
__label__1 you will have to have this app to read books other than those purchased  at the google play store on nexus 7 tablet.there are others that can be used but this is my favorite.clean delivery with no problems
__label__1 Love this app as well. It helps keep my books organized, keeps notes and highlights neatly in one area. The bookmarks and other options on this app help keep me organized.
__label__1 A straight forward reading platform that has always seemed to work.  Others I have tried just don't seem to be as reliable.  I don't know if there is better out there, as I stopped looking because this works reliably.  Like it.
__label__1 Everything that can be said has been said, the level of customization is amazing but the navigation is intuitive enough that anyone can setup the simplest routine or a very elaborate alarm schedule without getting a headache. Awesome app! The timer is a 
__label__1 I've been using this app for 6 months and it hasn't failed me yet. I set it for the morning and also can set it for naps. This is the one app I can't do without. Thanks developer's for a great alarm. Thanks Amazon for the most used app I have.
__label__1 Update: 5 stars for certain sure.Great app, love it, use it all the time. Had to download again due to phone problem, and looked more closely at the Permissions. Had some major questions, so wrote the developer.  Got an almost instant and fully informati
__label__1 I first tried the free version and was happy with it but this one is great. It is very versatile and has many applications that you use day to day. This is a very good App and i would recommend this one to all.
__label__1 This application is amazing! I love the progressively louder alarm.  I finally get to wake up softly. It is also very customizable!
__label__1 I picked up the free version of this app then the paid version popped up on the free app of the day so I downloaded it. the free version is quite full and useful and doesn&apos;t feel like things are missing from it so I probably wouldn&apos;t pay for th
__label__1 This alarm clock is great. It is really easy to use. I can have different times for the week days and weekends.I like the different tones and that I can pick music.I suck at math so having to do a math problem to turn it off really works.
__label__1 I've had some pretty annoying alarm clocks in my life, but this one is a winner!!! I started using it when my stock alarm stopped working. Stock works again, but ACX is much better, with many more features!!! Great useful app, thanx:-)Dear amazon, it wou
__label__1 Easy to use, reliable; very solid app.I would like to see the widget made a little prettier and would LOVE a 1x1 widget.
__label__1 I&apos;ve been using the free version for months. I love it  thank you amazon for giving us this one for free
__label__1 I&apos;ve had the free version for a while, and it&apos;s been great. I&apos;m not sure what th difference is with the paid, but I think it&apos;s the ability to set unlimited alarms. it&apos;s a great little app! it definitely deserves more than four st
__label__1 I like having multiple alarms, and being able to select different songs. It is easy to use, and set up, I have one work day alarm and another for other occasions that I turn as needed.
__label__1 i love the custom features in this one.  i dont get startled out of sleep anymore, the gradual volume increase is just what i needed.
__label__1 I use this instead of the stock android alarm because you get more options, the LG revolution has a crappy alarm clock, this is much more natural feeling.
__label__1 My favorite alarm clock app.  I&apos;m really happy that it&apos;s the free app of the day; I was planning on buying it anyway and I just saved some cash!
__label__1 This app does everything I need. It always works, restarts as needed, etc. Widget to show next alarm time and great advanced settings.
__label__0 don&apos;t know how, since it doesn&apos;t dl 2 SD. but, somehow my SD card is now read only &amp; it happened immediately after opening this app.
__label__1 This alarm clock likes u to pick many different audio options, and the turn off feature is math from easy 5-2 to complex algebra, some of it is very hard especially when you are half wake! Love!EDIT: i STILL use this everyday!!!best money i have ever spe
__label__1 High praise for this app.  I use it for my default  alarms, and for daily time reminders. It's HIGHLY configurable, set the amount of snooze (or none), the the length of ring, anything you can think of is in the app. Great work Angle Labs!
__label__1 I have a problem hitting the snooze over and over in the mornings.  AFter twenty years of working I should be use to getting up early but that will never happen.  This alarm is awesome, I have it set prompt me to solve math problems before I can hit snoo

__label__1 I use this app every day. I love the many aspects of customization, from what alarm noise to use to the difficulty level of math problems. It allows you to make it perfect for YOU. I wouldn't change a thing about it.
__label__1 I use this alarm app every day to wake me up for military formations and for important meetings whenever I'm sleeping or need a reminder.This app has never failed me. I got it as a "Free App of the Day" a while back, but I would pay $10 for this app beca
__label__1 I do love it. I like that you can choose  from the music playlist andI like the way that the alarm gets progressively louder and louder.That way it does not startle me. It is GREAT!!!!!
__label__1 This if the best little app I&apos;ve downloaded on my cell. I use it as an alarm in the morning, a cooking timer, a reminder to take my meds, a quick nap timer, and even a reminder to get the mail.  You can set this alarm for hours and even days in adva
__label__1 this is an excellent alarm clock app that is loaded with more options than i've seen in any stock alarm.
__label__1 I&apos;ve been using this for a long time; ever since I bought my phone actually. I used the free version for about a month and then decided to buy the full version. Even though it&apos;s available free today, I don&apos;t regret one bit paying for this,
__label__1 This provides exactly what I was looking for: multiple alarms with different sounds (including ones you import). I use it with different nature sounds to signal when class begins, when I've got 10 minutes to go, when class ends, and when office hours are
__label__1 Overview: This has been Lifehacker's choice as the alarm clock app to get for some time. Simply put, this is the all in one alarm clock app that you have been looking for. It will use your playlist or phone/tablet sounds to alert you for whatever you nee
__label__1 Well, I say hands down, but really it's hands on! I love the functionality of having to perform math to dismiss or snooze.Of course there is always room for improvement but even as is, it's an amazing app.
__label__1 I've been using this for about a year now and I can safely say that it is the best app for Android. I love that I can set the length of snooze, the way to wake up (math problems) and the ring gradually getting louder, but starting very softly.The only th
__label__1 I have a heck of a time waking up even when I get a full night of sleep. I always hit the alarm and go back to sleep without even remembering I had woken up. This lets me wake up to any song I want on my phone while I solve a handful of math problems. It
__label__1 this is by far the most well used alarm clock in my family so please use and get it you will not regret it
__label__1 Got this application from the android market and had a problem once my Droid x updated a while back. They responded with multiple emails and had the problem fixed in no time.
__label__1 Especially with the latest updates. I use the math feature which requires me to wake up enough to solve moderate (you can choose easy to tough) math equations.There are tons of settings and seemingly endless individual alarms.I recommend this app.
__label__1 This app is very pleasing to the eye. It is easy to use and dependable. very well designed. Thanks for a great app.
__label__1 I had the free version and loved it! Much better than the alarm app that came on my Droid X. Now getting the paid version as Amazon&apos;s free app of the day is even better! Thanks Amazon ;)
__label__1 Always hated the stock alarm - sometimes it simply did not work.  I have been using the free version for months now - not sure what the differences between the two are.  I really like the alarm and the multiple options it provides.  As a note - I gave it
__label__1 Sooooo much options, this thing rocks folks.  I was looking for a good system alarm replacement and found this on Amazon, for free!  But most definitely worth the couple bucks they charge for this.  Truly customizable and great user interface.  Thanks.
__label__1 Love the alarm, but I have yet to see any difference between the free version and the paid version. \nFor those complaining about permissions and GPS usage, that is optional only if you want to use those features! Really now, actually USE the app before 
__label__1 I like this app so much that I upgraded to the full version even though there is apparently little difference from the free version. The alarm settings are great, choose from sounds or music, limit your snooze settings so you never over-snooze, set for w
__label__1 Works very well and I use it all the time.  Even for an afternoon power nap at the lab.  One of my most used apps.  Very good app. I would download again.  Thanks!
__label__1 Love that I don't have to have the little alarm notification on all the time. Don't ask me why, but that just bothers me. I love apps that allow you to customize little pointless things like that. This one allows you to set a color theme, choose from ala

__label__1 I have used this app for some time (the free version) and it has a few features that stand out. Max amount of snoozes, Math problems with 5 difficulty settings and a choice of how many are solved before able to hit snooze. There are also customizable way
__label__1 Nice little alarm app. lets you use music (select specific songs,  random by artist, etc), ringtones, and more. Several snooze &amp; dismissal options. Just a great app overall.
__label__1 Have been using the free version of this clock for 10 months and it has served me well. the alarm has never failed to wake me. used daily. easy to set and use. has plenty of options. purchased recently and will continue to use it.
__label__1 I have never had issues with these alarms and I've been using it for over a year now. Wonderful app!
__label__1 This was the first app I bought when I got my EVO Shift.  The timer, snooze options, and math capabilities rock. Dev(s) respond quickly to email, and, while it may have been planned already, the enhancement I asked for was in the next release.
__label__1 Really like the app! This clock is perfect since the beginning and keeps getting better :) I've tried a lot of different clock apps and this by far is simply the BEST!!
__label__1 I use this daily and for a variety if activities -- to wake up,to get ready for something, to wake up my kids or husband, to start the crock pot, to turn off the sprinklet in my garden... you get the idea! Each alarm you servile is extremely customizeabl
__label__1 Liked it so much I bought it.  I tried several &#34;alarm clock radio&#34; aps before I settled on this one.  Easily the best, it will let you:-have multiple alarms (I have ten saved for various times/days of the week)-choose any music on you Kindle as y
__label__1 I was at the PayPal hackathon meetup when they wrote the prototype for this app... I now have harp music wake me up every morning... love it!
__label__1 This is my every day alarm clock now, I love the mechanism of making you do simple math problems to kill the alarm - keeps me out of trouble big time!Very reliable and good to use.
__label__1 I freaking love this app it always wakes me up on time in the morning when I need it too. Way better than preinstalled junkGalaxy s 4g tmobile
__label__1 best alarm clock app there is. got this for free quite a few months back as the FAotD. use it all the time
__label__1 This is a great app... I liked the free version so much I bought the &#34;add free&#34; version... just to help out the developer and get rid of the ads.Now I wake up to &#34;Shock the Monkey&#34; or whatever I like, and I like the way it starts out at a
__label__1 great app, especially for those who lost their alarm clock on their HTC Droid Inc 2. I have used this regularly and it is simple, reliable, and effective.
__label__1 I use this as my alarm clock and it works great! I have not had a single issue with it at all. I used the free version for a long time with no issues as well. It has been extremely reliable and does not use much battery power at all.
__label__1 I hate alarm clocks. Freak me out actually. I can set classical music with this, which makes me happy to wake up to. It also has an ascending option that is nice. A very large SNOOZE and or small dismiss button. And if you think you can turn it off and s
__label__1 I guess I SHOULD be more disciplined and ready to jump out of bed when my alarm goes off. this app fills in the gap between how I should be and how I actually am. I love the math feature. Make your half asleep morning brain do math in order to shut off t
__label__1 Started to buy app on Market advertised for. 99 but purchase page said $1.49. So I bought it here on Amazon for .99. Great alarm, much better than Gentle Alarm.
__label__1 I love it. Multiple alarms with a ton of options as well as a pile of tones to choose from.  Simple to use. Can't be beat !
__label__1 For several months now, and I simply cannot say enough good things about it.\n\nFor those wondering why all the reviews are 5 stars, it&apos;s because this is simply a great alarm. Stop pretending like you are a Jedi trying to bring balance to the force 
__label__1 It allows you to make yourself do fairly challenging math problems before you can silence it, which makes quickly hitting the snooze button pretty much impossible.
__label__1 I love this app.  It has the most features and has the most customizability of all the alarm apps. The only suggestion is have is to put in a QR scanner to shut the alarm off.
__label__0 My clock beta has a better ui.  I have used it forever, but got this cuz it was free.  So I am going back to my clock.
__label__1 I had just downloaded the free version about an hour before it became free app of the day. It is a great alarm, but I think I like gentle alarm better.
__label__1 Author has continued adding features to a very good alarm application. Now the application is more than an alarm, having a timer.
__label__1 Gentle alarm was featured previously not alarm clock Xtreme. Wish Amazon had a way to weed out people to dumb to post.  And why give 1 star for a app if it was free before? \n\nThis is to review the app not whether it was free before, seems you people ar
__label__1 Best alarm clock app I've come across. I've tried several other alarm clocks from the market, but this is the easiest to customize and use. Definitely recommend !
__label__1 This isn&apos;t the same alarm. Last time it was gentle alarm by mobitobi. In essence, they are similar to one another.
__label__1 Well designed ; Easily tailored to meet any need ; Clear interface ; Flawless execution ; Worth every pennyThis is the standard for alarm clocks!
__label__1 There are three features that make this app the best:1. The extremely large snooze button2. Ability to play your own music as the alarm3. The gradual volume increase of the musicThat's it. It shouldn't be complicated. It just needs to function.
__label__1 I love this alarm clock because of its versatility, reliability and ease  in customizing. Everything fun this developer is well worth it.  ing
__label__1 Great app.  Got it as a faotd, and I'm glad I did.  This is now my goto alarm clock.  The crescendo alarm is a very nice touch!
__label__1 I usually silence my alarm by pressing random buttons when I&apos;m half asleep. I can&apos;t do that with this app. I have to actually turn on my brain on order to turn off the alarm. I didn&apos;t think I&apos;d like the math equations either, but it W
__label__1 At first I had the free version and I appreciated it so much, I was happy to go back and pay for the app.  The developer deserves the recognition for providing a rock solid alarm clock and timer.  I use my phone's alarm to wake up every morning, keep on 
__label__1 This app is wonderful. I use it every day. I downloaded it on two generations of kindled. Works reliably and is easy to use.
__label__1 This alarm app is so good, so reliable, with so many features it should come standard on all android devices.
__label__1 It is easy to use, intuitive, and does a great job of getting you out of bed. One thing I like is that when it goes off it starts off quietly and then builds louder, making it so that I hear it before my wife does and prevent it from up waking her up. Ve
__label__1 Does exactly what it claims it will.  I use it every day.  intuitive Interface.And it is good looking.  Used it for several months now.
__label__1 Has all kinds of settings from doing math to disable the alarm to being in your car.  This alarm had saved me tons of times.  Any customization to an alarm clock you'd ever need
__label__1 It actually woke me up right now and I didn&apos;t have to over sleep! I had to solve 3 hard math problems and man that works!! This is so awesome! I&apos;m never going to over sleep again!
__label__1 This is been a great app ever since I downloaded it. I&apos;ve had the free version for over a year now and it is kept me from oversleeping is perfect to have especially when doing math problems in order to have to snooze or dismiss the alarm.
__label__1 I have been using this as my primary alarm clock since 2011 and have had no problems.  Very user friendly.
__label__1 I used the free version for some time and loved it. I bought it a few months ago because you could set up multiple alarms and select the days they would go off which was important to me.\n\nDOWNLOAD THIS APP. Free or paid for it doesn&apos;t matter it is
__label__0 I guess extreme means going off 15 minutes late if at all... also most of the time I have to take the battery out to turn it off - uninstalling
__label__1 This is a great alarm clock application.  I use it everyday to make sure I get myself out of bed and into work.  A lot of great customizable features to tailor the alarm to how you want to be woken up.
__label__1 I gladly paid for it. you&apos;d be nuts to pass up on this app while it&apos;s free. the app is updated frequently, and the devs are responsive to feedback and requests for help. I prefer to set music as my alarm sounds; you can even tell the app to ran
__label__1 This app does everything I need it to do. The countdown finger is a nice bonus. Love that u can set do many different ones since my  schedule varies from day to day, not your typical Monday thru Friday work weekt
__label__1 I love this app &lt;3 it makes me think unlike my bedside alarm which just makes me locate the off button. this alarm requires my brain to function to shut it up. yeah you can snooze it but you can limit the # of snoozes you allow yourself. when you&apos
__label__1 I would highly recommend this app anybody that wants a alarm clock better than with your phone came with. fast and easy to program each alarm and the interface is very cool too.
__label__1 I have multiple repeating alarms set and it works great for me.  I have my work week alarm.  I have a daily morning and evening alarm set to remind me to give my cat its thyroid medicine.  I have a couple weekly work task related alarms.I like the alarm 
__label__1 This app is actually a very integral part of my life. It is responsible for getting me up every morning. I should give this app a low rating, as I hate having to wake up early, but it does its job fantastically. I have been using it for over a year and h
__label__1 They have switched to the new updated ICS style time picker....time to find a new alarm app or hopefully I have a backup of the old version I can restore to.  Developers are spending more time on switching UI stuff than adding features these days. I stil
__label__1 The level of customization that is offered is outstanding. This is a definite upgrade from the stock app. If you need a smart alarm clock on your phone, this is it. \n
__label__1 I love the gps feature for setting an alarm when I have to go to another building at a set time for my work.  You can set it so you are moving at a minimum speed before the alarm disables.  Very useful for me.
__label__1 this is one awesome app, for the price it isn't that bad. It's every customizable and works great. we know your phone has a an alarm clock, but why not try something different.
__label__1 I&apos;ve been using the free version for a while, and I&apos;m so pleased to see the ad free version as free app of the day.  This alarm gets me up and alert every morning.  There&apos;s so many settings and modifications to tailor to your personal need
__label__1 I&apos;ve been using the free version for several months now and it has worked great. Upgraded to the full version thanks to amazon&apos;s free app of the day. Great no ads now! Even the free version has all of the features you could want in an alarm and
__label__1 OK, I know this is an alarm clock, but I am fortunate to not need one. I still use this all the time to remind me of conference calls, appointments or anything else I need to do at a specific time. if I could schedule an alarm at a certain date I'd give 
__label__1 Love the many settings. I can wake gently to my favorite song, artist, or playlists and I can set how long it takes to get loud and how loud it gets. It has different options for snooze and dismiss also.
__label__1 I have never had such a wonderful alarm clock!  I have had the free version for about a week and loved it.  Combined with my Mabilo ringtone app music, I&apos;ve been in heaven!  Goodbye annoying limited plug in alarm clock....Hello Alarm Xtreme!
__label__1 Outstanding escalating alarm sounds.  Loud enough to wake the dead and me!  You can set it to make you do math calculations before it will disable the alarm.  Gets by the old problem. of &quot;I don't even remember turning off  the alarm &quot;
__label__1 i was going to buy this on fri but was delighted it was app of the day.. great app\nwords words words words
__label__1 this is the best alarm clock I have ever used in my life. give it a shot wont regret it
__label__0 another alarm clock didn't work so I bought this one in hopes that it would work.  The alarm did not go off nor did it wake the kindle up.  I left it on but the kindle went to sleep and when I tried to wake the kindle it crashed.  Had to do a 20 second h
__label__1 Used the free version for a few months and it worked great so I wanted to support the developers and upgraded to paid. I've used other alarms, but like this one the best.
__label__1 I had the free version for awhile but would always end up clicking the advertisement at the bottom instead of the snooze button...which proved to be very annoying when just woken up! Lol! I purchased the paid version and have NO complaints or issues!
__label__1 excellent app. I started with the free version, which was great, but soon switched to the paid. I wanted at the features and no ads to accidentally hit in my groggy morning state, though that never even happened. I am also in favor of supporting good dev
__label__1 I haven't tried all the Android alarm clocks, but this one works great for me. Tons of features and easy to use.
__label__1 my time management sucks @ times.  This clock keeps me going.  I swap work schedules, this lets me have all of them in point and click mode.  Even better it can forces you to do things to snooze, of course that means now I can do math in my sleep.  This 
__label__1 It works very well, easy to use. I recommend it. It's reliable. Good options: music, sounds and more. X xo
__label__1 At the moment this is my favorite alarm app. I especially like the crescendo feature. You can feel confident getting this alarm app!
__label__1 ===== OLD REVIEW 12/16/11 (please see update below) =====When I bought this app, I only found one review that specifically mentioned the Kindle Fire. That review said it didn't work and mentioned a problem, but didn't really go into it. I can list all th
__label__1 I have used it for a few years now and I wanted to support the developers and get rid of the ads which were, of course, right next to the dismiss button. Now I have larger buttons in a more user friendly interface. I can full size mp3 for alarms or timer
__label__1 I use my phone as an alarm clock in hotels, at home, and pretty much everywhere. I bought the better version to avoid ads, and I haven't been disappointed. Interface for setting alarms is easy and intuitive, snooze works great, no problems at all.
__label__1 App is great and easy to use. Makes life easier when you are using your device and need to be on time! Highly recommend it for daily use.
__label__1 this is best alarm clock app ever. customize alarms for day and time of day. The alarm sound fades in slowly into a crescendo. dismissing the alarm is as easy or as hard as you would like.
__label__1 allows for multiple saved alarms, great for someone like me who has a rotating schedule and odd hours.would like a &amp;#34;smart&amp;#34; alarm option, where music plays a few minutes prior to the alarm allowing you to turn it off if youre already awake
__label__0 samsung droid charge has crappy internal memory.  cant spare space for apps that have to live on my phone.  therefore this app is no good.  didnt bother playing with it as a result
__label__0 this thing woke me up at 2:00 in the morning and I had school I was tired all day this thing stinks lame!!! @$%*
__label__1 jolting, loud, and annoying sounds is what it takes to wake me up for school. the volume crechendo option is perfect for my needs.
__label__1 This is the only alarm I use anymore. It has so many options. Adjustable snoozes. The volume can be set to come on gradually so that I don't get startled awake. It's so customizable, that you can make it exactly what you need it to be. I also love the co
__label__1 Reliable.  Use it every day.  Doesn't crash, can add multiple alarms.  Bought the full version to eliminate ads.  Good buy.
__label__1 it is my love whenever I have to go to school I put an alarm in my fire and it wakes me up! I am in love with this alarm
__label__1 just wanting to balance the stupid people rating one star because they think some reviews are fake. you guys are morons. this is a great app that does have some nice features the stock alarms do not have. take it or leave it, to each his own.
__label__1 Like many others have mentioned I&apos;ve been using the free version for a while now and got this when it appeared. You can set multiple alarms with many ways to customize your alarm. (Shaking your phone, solving math problems, and a lot more) All in al

__label__1 This is a well designed and easy to use alarm that can actually get just about anyone out of bed in the morning. \n\nThe GPS permission may seem odd, until you read what the app uses it for.\n\nJust picture it - you&apos;re driving (or biking) in rush ho
__label__1 Been using this since it was free app of the day.  Always have backed up on titanium backup for fast restore. Great job
__label__1 I&apos;ve had this clock since I got my andriod.  Used the free version for months and never failed then I bought the application.  Glad it&apos;s a FAOTD. You can have multiple alarms and you can have different songs to wake you up. LOVE IT!
__label__1 ...for my taste, Gentle Alarm is better. After years of being jolted awake by alarms, I much prefer the slow, quiet approach.\n\nIf you decide to oversleep, you can still do it after entering a math problem.
__label__1 This app received 4.5 stars on the market. Good app. 1 star reviews are fake and are written by a competitor. I am a professional writer and I recognize that all 1 star reviews all say the same thing, so they are all fake. Developer, dont let these moron
__label__0 I installed it &amp; set it up to alarm me this morning. did Not go off &amp; it ran down my battery so bad that it took hours to recharge then a hard restart ( Hold button in several seconds). NOT compatible with Kindle Fire. only gets 1 star for ease o
__label__1 This is by far the best alarm app out there. Very customizable in almost every way. That's why I upgraded to the pro version.
__label__1 Lots of alarm sound choices, so when your sick of one, you have hundreds to choose from.  Also you can use your own music.  You can choose how many snooze are allowed, how long, even that each snooze decreases in time.  You can set snooze to have math pr
__label__1 I have been using this app as my only alarm clock for years now. Super easy to set up but has all the options under the hood. Love it!
__label__1 I deliberated on which alarm clock app to get and am glad I decided on this one. Easy to configure, love the wake to music that gradually gets louder and that big snooze button!
__label__1 Alarm Clock Xtreme is the first app I ever bought for Android almost two years ago, the day it came out. Over that time it&apos;s received innumerable updates and improvements. It started out as a reliable alternative to other alarm clock apps as well as
__label__1 This is a very cool app. Lots of options for creating manyalarms and types of alarms. This app should come as part of Androidso we don't have to install it on top of the stock OS of the phone.If you use/need alarms on your cell phone, get this.
__label__1 It actually works pretty good. The alarm sound can start out quiet and slowly get louder until there&apos;s no way you could sleep through it.
__label__1 This is the most reliable alarm clock app that I have ever purchased. I was tired of testing and reading reviews of other apps that proved to be marginal to good. Heck, this one even has a reliable &#34;egg timer&#34; feature. Also you can select your fa
__label__1 I used the free version of this app for over a month and loved it so much that I finally bought the ad-free one from the Android Market recently. I like being able to set the number of allowed snooze hits so that I don't get carried away. I also use the

__label__1 This app is the only thing that can keep me from sleeping in. get it if you have the same habit as me. Galaxy S
__label__1 This is a fantastic alarm clock application. Much better than the stock one that comes with Android. I got it as a Free App of the Day, but would gladly have paid for it.
__label__1 I love how you can customize this app. I've never overslept. There are so many ways to set it up, but it is not complicated.
__label__1 This app is perfect for my purposes. I use it and absolutely rely on it every day. Not only to awake in the morning but also for any thing I need to be notified about all day long.I love it, Great job folks.
__label__1 I used to have such a hard time finding an alarm program that would actually force me to wake s in the morning.  this app does. :-) just that. its worth it just for that.  there is a free version that works. better
__label__1 I started use this app when my HTC Sense clock app stopped working.  After HTC finally fixed the clock app, I stayed with this app instead.  I particularly like being able to play a wake-up tune instead of hearing an annoying, repeating noise.  The volum
__label__1 This is an amazing app and worth every penny. I would recommend this to anyone who has trouble waking up in the morning.
__label__1 I've been using the free version of this for years and been very happy with it. I decided to buy it as a "thank you" to the developer.I can set up several alarms, and only pick the ones I need. Tonight, for example, I'm setting four.....
__label__1 THIS IS NOT A REPEAT APP! Geez... Had the free version but the ads used to get on my nerves... Very happy that it's free today!~Someone who's NOT a developer
__label__1 The alarm app born of one brilliant person&apos;s attempt to outsmart herself. The only bad thing I can say about it, is that IT WORKS. I accidentally set the math dismiss option once then kept forgetting to change it. Do you know that if you force yours
__label__1 I think that the best thing about this alarm is the widget. It simply shows the time of your next active alarm. That one feature makes it more useful than most other alarms I've seen and used.
__label__1 This has become my bedside alarm. I have a Kindle Fire 8.9 with a great recharge dock. The dock has a bluetooth link and speakers. I use the  for a night lite and waking me up. It has ability to set many alarms base on days and times.
__label__1 The title of this app is apt to what it is: it's an alarm clock and it's extreme.This alarm clock is so annoying, it makes me want to smash my phone into the wall, but darn it, it wakes me up. The app lets you set as many alarms as you need and has many 
__label__1 I love this app! I'm a heavy sleeper and this alarm really works. Check it out! It wakes my as_ up for real.

__label__1 This is fantastic, it helps me get up in the morning so much better than just a normal alarm. Since I actually have to think to do the math, and it allows me to NOT have a snooze, I get right up!
__label__1 i&apos;ve been using the free version of this ap for months now. i chose the theme song from the 1970&apos;s doctor who show.  wakes me up EVERY time!!  especially with the crescendo option. freaky but works for me. the do math problems option is not for
__label__1 I used the free version of this app for a year and a half and have finally upgraded to the paid version to support the developers of this great app. This is a full-featured, easy to use alarm clock that lets you customize almost anything you can think of
__label__1 I have had this app forever. It has never once failed me. I wake each morning exactly the way I choose, with music gently getting louder and a set number of snoozes before I answer three hard math questions to turn it off.
__label__1 It's awesome. I use it every day! i use it for so much such as reminders and eke up calls!
__label__1 Every morning I wake  up(not to this or any alarm), roll over and grab my galaxy tab.  I unplug it (did you know you can&apos;t use it while its charging? Piece of crap but that&apos;s a whole different  issue), push the awake button, and go straight  to

__label__1 Versatile. I love being able to wake to music I enjoy. Appreciate the big buttons when eyes are blurry with sleep. Great for setting many different alarms and turning them on /off by selecting/de-selecting. Can turn vibrate on/off. Can have volume slowly
__label__1 A great app! Better than any alarm clock that you can buy in any store. I only use my  regular clock to tell time without having to touch my phone.
__label__1 super useful, would pay to upgrade if I could connect it to Pandora for music to wake up to since I don't have any on my fire :) but great app use it everyday, and helps me stay on track with regular stuff :)
__label__1 This is now my best alarm clock in my home.  It has great options along with the alarm, like a stop watch, and a count down timer that I use even more than the alarm.  Great selection of sounds, both soft, progressive, and loud to choose from.  Thanks fo
__label__1 I use the free version of this app for a long time and eventually paid for it, I liked it so much. The developer is responsive and the app works perfectly. \n
__label__1 I have been using this for my alarm for quite a while. My favorite feature is probably the slowly rising volume. It often allows me to catch it before it gets loud and either disturbs others or startles me.
__label__1 I cannot find a flaw with this alarm clock, nor can I think of the feature that is missing. It is amazing, worth every penny, is light years ahead of the stock android alarm clock and I absolutely love how the alarm volume can be set to steadily get loud
__label__1 Thousands more options then stock, knowing what I know now, I'd buy this even if I hadn't gotten it as fapotd! Crescendo, or ascending ringtones are great! Snooze options, virtually unlimited alarms, auto snooze via gps, and many many more options. Great
__label__1 What a great alarm clock app!!! I love being able to customize the different alarms I use everyday. It's never let me down.
__label__1 Just installed and tested the Alarm Clock Xtreme app on my Galaxy S phone w/ 2.1 (Eclair).  This is a very good alarm clock app.  You can set the alarm for different times or different days.  There is even a timer setting that you can  use like an egg ti
__label__1 This puppy gets me up for work every day. I use this in addition to the regular stock alarm clocks also. If it gets ME up it definitely works.

__label__1 This really is just a spectacular alarm app. It has a wealth if advanced settings and great features, such as limiting the times you are allowed to hit snooze or requiring that you solve math problems in order to turn off an alarm completely. The option 
__label__1 This is hands down the best alarm app that I have used. The ascending tone is much less abrasive than having it begin at full volume.Great alarm.
__label__1 I have only used this app once and I LOVED it. Love the crescendo feature on it. Nothing bad on the app! Works great on the LG Ally!
__label__1 great cam &amp; adds auto focus (hd2 android) only complaint is that annoying intro screen with no way to skip it. missed cool photos waiting for that damn slide to pass otherwise great

__label__0 I purchased this to &#34;find&#34; saved copies on my kindle fire.  Couldn't find them on this or anywhere else on my kindle.
__label__1 This app is truly wonderful. I downloaded it because of the good reviews, and it did things I didn't even know I wanted. Fantastic app. Does exactly what it says, and keeps my files so organized. thank you!
__label__1 I use File Expert to copy and delete files, install apps, etc., and it works really well. It seems reliable and is very easy to use. Recommended.
__label__1 this works well, I used it to operate some cracked files on my kindle, easy to work and no problems
__label__0 this has many features I like. I even prefer the interfacs to astro, but there is one thing I can't find. Where is the ability to navigate to the parent folder. No not a back botton but a link to the folder containing the current folder. for example FTP 
__label__1 A realy like my kindle. The forked android operating system can be annoying. You really need access to the file system and this tool works well.
__label__1 This app serves all user purposes and then some. My favorite feature is sharing my kindle/phone files over an FTP link. There are also a few skins available for the UI that are very well made. By far my favorite explorer for mobile and tablet devices.
__label__1 Program does what it is supposed to do, access your files so you can delete them, move them, etc. Thanks
__label__1 wonderful app, i use it alot, work like a charm. its a must download for those apk file or any file to mess with.
__label__1 Everything you have on your unit is all on one app. No more searching! I recommend this app 100 percent!
__label__0 Could not figure out how to select multiple (but not all) files except by using search on common characteristics in name (e.g. Search for ".mp4")Other products offer this...Looked for help on vendor site, but forum is filled with "this is the best" comme
__label__0 Another wasteless app that takes up too much room to do whatit should do. What more needs to be said!!!!
__label__1 Works Great. Could not get Candy Crush to run on Kindle Fire HD. This great app made it happen.For Candy Crush Saga lovers using this app and the Candy Crush Saga all help link gives youstep by step instruction. Works Great on Kindle Fire HD.
__label__0 I couldn't figure out how the app worked. After a half hour, I gave up and found another app that didn't make my head hurt. Perhaps you'll have better luck & more patients.
__label__1 I enjoy this app and have it on every one of my devices. the only downside (if I can find any) is that there are several plugins that require purchase.  but that being said they are worth every penny.
__label__1 I've tried them all on amazon's app store and this the best one because of it's abundance of features i.e., file sharing, easy to navigate ui, and over all usability.  definitely a must have for the kf.
__label__1 The best file manager: stable and feature rich.  Also has great sharing features. It updates very frequently which is a little annoying.
__label__1 I love this ap for one main reason and one main reason. only and that is because IT HELPED ME GET TEMPLE RUN!!!!!!!!!!!!!
__label__1 OMG I love that I can now play Candy Crush on my Kindle!  Anyone in the same &#34;App creators are all Apple Stockholders and hate android users' boat will want this app.  Just Google &#34;How to put (candy crush or other game where there is no Kindle ap
__label__0 Did not work on my kindle fire. I would not recommend this to anyone. Stay away from this app thing
__label__1 I like software that does what is supposed to do and does it well. I have serviced computers for 25 years and I am really fussy about how software works.I like this app because it works extremely well and has many features not considered by other softwar
__label__0 Just another hole for someone to get into your phone or kindle and download your files.  This is more a file sharing app that shares all your files on the network.  I don't need it.
__label__1 hi guys to get rid of that annoying message go to.settings and uncheck the box for warn me about new versions. I went a step further and installed the version from the maker.
__label__0 Pros - It's freeCons - Most have full (paid) version to access several functions.  The File manager only works with a WIFI connection.  What happens if I want to work with File Manager where there's no WIFI?  And why does it need to connect with anything
__label__1 I have this app downloaded from the app market and I have to say it is the most comprehensive free file manager on the market
__label__1 This worked perfectly. No hassle, no unwanted ads, no BS. Just the program and the program did exactly what I needed it to do. Strongly Recommended.
__label__0 The File Expert uploaded a virus on my Laptop and crashed my PC. I started receiving Pop-ups from various Tech Support Companies, stating my PC had been compromised: and in order to clean up my PC, there would be a cost of $79.00 to clean it.  Needless t
__label__0 This non pro version did almost what I needed so I bought the pro key.  That did not work out and I've not gotten the pro features to work.  No one has yet replied to my email asking for assistance over 3 weeks later.  I went to creator's web site to get

__label__1 The other reviews are spot-on. This app is PERFECT. I needed a simple app to copy and paste files and create new folders, this does the job beautifully. Couldn't be happier!
__label__1 This app helped me find and edit files that I had on the kindle. for rooted devices, i dont recommend. I would recommend es file explorer but my device is not rooted, so it is great having this and es
__label__1 This app allows you to access all the various files on your device. Be careful you don't inadvertently delete system files, or other important files. Aside from that, highly recommended.
__label__1 found this to be very useful in my down- loads.I would recommend this to my friends as a must have..
__label__1 does everything i could need. makes folders, moves files easily, it's easy to find a certain video and the image viewer is great. can be moved to sd card to save precious phone storage. only downside is you have to exit out or it keeps running in backgro
__label__1 I prefer this file manger over Cyanogenmod's built in one. For free, you really would have a hard time doing worse.
__label__1 This app was able to take the place of 3 on my phone. The root functions are a plus as well. It also helps me sync files and such to my Kindle Fire.So glad for this app!
__label__1 Really eases all file handling tasks.  Locating, deleting, moving, and uninstalling are all made very simple with this app.  This works a lot better than the built in apps that came with my tablet.
__label__1 A very good application which is very useful to access files on the kindle fire hd  tablet I would recommend it
__label__1 I purchased product so I could download the Candy Crush Saga. I'm not sure what it does but it works. I was able to download and play the game with no problem.
__label__1 this file manager is absolutely the best, and trust me, I tried them all. what doesn't it do? little smb server ftp server, connects to my mac and to my western digital live tv. oh, and it also manages files on the sd card. does compression decompression
__label__1 it got me temple run on kindle fire! I play it a lot! you can also get many other games!  very few glitches.
__label__1 This is by far the most feature rich file manager i've found for the Fire.  The Samba client is most welcome.
__label__1 This app is perfect and does just what it says. My favorite thing about this app is that you can download other apps through it that can't be found in the Fire's version of the app store. The Dolphin browser is amazing and I'll never use the factory brow
__label__0 I used to love this app but now it is worthless. The app did everything that couldn't normally be done on the Kindle. Now that the app has been updated it refuses to install. I have my settings set to allow third party apps but still no go. I also have p
__label__1 I have ES File Explorer, but I wanted something else. I downloaded this and I am very happy with it. Works well on my Kindle Fire HD with no issues. I even like the layout a little better. Not as much clutter as other apps of this type.Recommend this one
__label__1 If you have an Android, you need this file explorer.  Everytime I open it up I find out something else that it can do.  It does an excellent job of interfacing with Dropbox.  The next step is if they can figure out how to allow me to access my Amazon Clo
__label__1 Honestly, I only downloaded this app to be able to install the Facebook game Candy Crush Saga to my Kindle Fire HD.  But I soon found out what a  great app this is. You should try it
__label__1 I used this program to &#34;side load&#34; Android Apps on my Kindle HD 8.9.&#34;The Economist&#34; magazine application is only available for Android on Google Play.Since the app was not available as an Amazon app, I was forced to &#34;side load&#34; th

__label__1 helped getting the game I have been trying to download for days. would recommend this to anyone needing to download.

__label__1 I amso busy trying to master my other game that I haven't tried itbut I know it is there and I will play it.
__label__1 File Expert gives you more options than the file cabinet installed on the tablet.  I was able to locate my files faster and do more inside my files.  I was able to view pictures, play videos, and play music all inside instead of opening different apps fo
__label__1 Love this program.  I can easily find any documents or music or app that I have downloaded.  It is easy to use, easy to locate and wonderful.  I Highly recommend it!!
__label__0 Deleted it.....it was free but read the reviews after words and they weren't good...never gave it a shot!! Read reviews people.

__label__1 I absolutely love this program. Thanks to file expert, i can now play candy crush on my kindle fire! Thanks!
__label__1 I use this as one of my &#34;essential&#34; Android tools.  I don't know if it's the best on the market because it did what I wanted to, is intuitive and easy-to-use, so I felt no need to look further.  Can't beat the price either. : )Kudos to the compan
__label__0 I couldn't figure out how to work it. I decided to use another one instead and it works much easier.
__label__1 Makes it easy to use the tablet.  When you need to move files, kill apps, just do basic housekeeping this works.
__label__0 I can't believe these developers keep throwing this open feint virus at us...  takes up massive space-can not remove it once installed (it reinstalls itself)-can not turn it off-it takes gross control of your permissions...  what about this does not scre
__label__0 this game looked a littlenfun for free so I got it bid.mistake! so dumb no action wouldn't have impressed me in the 80s!
__label__0 Sounds bad, looks worse, and both get higher scores than 'fun.'  Not worth more than a few minutes of your time, and you'll want those minutes back.
__label__0 As soon as I saw this app as the faotd I began laughing for about 10 min knowing that all the bad reviews would be hysterical.... seriously micronytes? This reminded me of an episode in futurama where they go inside fry's body to fight worms lol.... now 
__label__1 The increasing number of pseudo-comedians squeezing into their troll suits to give poor ratings to the FAOTD really need a new hobby and a dictionary.  That said...On Kindle Fire:Micronytes is an amusing, entertaining game with great replay value. The cu

__label__0 the game wouldn't even download. it is really awful. do not get it unless you really want to. :( it is such a slow download, not worth the wait.
__label__1 Why do (some) people don't have nothing to do but complain about OpenF but gladly give Amazon their credit card number? If you don't like, or want OpenF on your phone, then do everyone a favor, move along! Amazon do try and ferret the apps they put on th

__label__1 This may not be the first review like the guy that did the first one had to tell you, but mine Is the best. I haven't installed the game yet but it's down loading.  This is the best review!
__label__0 Well my title pretty much sums it up. boring,  repetitive, annoying music. graphics and storyline are poor. locked up and had to do a battery pull to exit. uninstalled. DROID 2 global
__label__0 I like the music and graphics. Cant rate how it plays because I cant finish the tutorial because the controls wont work.
__label__1 I'm the first review and this game is a time killer but a little challenging overall it is pretty fun.
__label__0 the grafics stink and so do the controls!I wouldn't waste a cent on this game!you have been warned!
__label__0 I downloaded this because it was free.  It was boring, hard to follow, and I didn't enjoy the graphics at all.
__label__1 This game works great on the Logitech Revue,this is probably the best game i have been able to play on the Google TV, it works using the dpad on the keyboard.
__label__0 Just had to one star this app to counteract all the 5 star trolls. I wish all you helicopter parents that think putting out a horrible POS deserves a 5 rating for effort  would just go away. I wonder if you people go to a restaurant and eat a horrible di

__label__1 Do you guys really expect the normal 1 star review from Superman on April Fools Day?  Come on...  It is DRIPPING in sugary sweet sarcasim!
__label__0 crashed during tutorial level. I have a nexus s phone.  maybe I'll give it another chance after an update, but its unplayable for me as of now
__label__0 This game is terrible. It's just crap. Boring and uninventive. Why are people giving this app five stars? it doesn't make sense to rate this app five stars just because other people are rating it one star
__label__0 I could understand if the app was so advanced that it used voice recognition via a Bluetooth headset. that would be amazing. but since that's not the case why do you (the Dev) need access to Bluetooth?as for the game its glitchy and suffers from poor lev
__label__0 Could not get past the first level. Just force closes. Seems like it'd get boring fast as well. Transformer Prime running android v4.0.3
__label__1 The controls are adjustable. Check the options page you lazy down loaders. Plays, sounds, looks good. Blue tooth is used for the zemote dumb dumbs. There are too many novices on this review.
__label__0 this game would be fun if it didn't lock up your kindle and every time you turn off your kindle it would still play the sound and the only way to turn off the sound is to shut down your kindle
__label__1 No... I am not kidding... best game ever. So addcting. Can't stop playing it. Download this because you will not regret it. It is OpenFeint free (and that is always good) Good controls. Good grafics. lots of levels. I am so addicted that I wont let my pa
__label__1 This is the best game ever. The story line is top notch, the graphics are superbly done, and the sound track is to die for. Five stars to help counter the daily bombardment of one star reviews from the trolls who have nothing better to do. - ;)

__label__0 MY BRAND NEW KINDLE FIRE HE GOT ALL MESSED UP FROM THIS APP AND WOULD RECOMMEND NOT! RISKING YOU KINDLE WITH THIS APP..
__label__1 I wanted something like alt/tab on my android and found this. It is very customizable, yet easy to use. I would highly recommend it for those that want to quickly and easily move from program to program.
__label__1 Yes! This app makes direct, one-click switching between any apps on your device -- VERY handy, for instance to copy txt or URL from a website & get quickly to Evernote to paste it. This does work under the basic Kindle Fire launcher, & makes it much more
__label__1 Amazon did well on this one. I know how they are when it comes to their Kindle Fire HD because I own one. This app will save me a lot of time switching apps when multitasking. It does it with ease and has a beautiful interface. You can re size the icons

__label__1 i tried a couple apps like this but this one is my favorite. I recommend it for anyone. it has lots of info for you! !! ! !
__label__1 It's fun to see baby's weekly growth.  The information provided is very helpful and the tips are worth paying attention to.

__label__1 This is a great app when you are expecting. Great articles; videos; and pictures to show each stage of the pregnancy.  a great tool.
__label__1 This app is very informative and helpful especially if you're a first time mother, I'm enjoying every part of this app!

__label__1 incredibly accurate. the information given clears doubts literally as they appear. the app links you to different videos & websites that are super helpful.
__label__1 I loved this app while I was pregnant. I used a few apps during my pregnancy, but this was by far my favorite! I even downloaded the &#34;my baby&#34; version of babycenter after I had the baby, and followed that one for his first year! So informative, f
__label__0 All this app does is give you a a few of the latest article titles with links to the web page.  I was expecting more. If /. is listening, you need the web page to format the articles for reading on tablets, 7 inch - like Kindle Fire, and 10 inch - like t
__label__1 Very good and up-to-date coverage of key technical items and subjects.  And, a mouse click brings you additional information.  A well-done news coverage.
__label__1 I got this as a free app of the day and my 6-year old absolutely loves it!  I was surprised he actually sat so long to play something that didn't involve fighting or graphics, but he really likes it.
__label__1 This is very simple and fun.  You can make mixed up monsters by flipping though the selection of heads, bodies and feet.  My kids like to shake it and just see what comes up.  My kids will play with it for about 10 minutes and then get board, but they do
__label__1 My kids love it! My 5 year old likes to mix up the body parts and then try to piece it back together the "correct" way while my 3 year old loves mixing them up to make "goofy" monsters- she laughs and loves to share her new creations!  Really great, simp

__label__1 I can turn my kindle fire into a universal remote for my desktop for FREE? F@#$ YES... I recommend this app to any kindle fire User.
__label__0 Totally confused how to get this to work. After doing some research, I realized this app needed control of my computer to work (sort of like a remote desktop). No way was I going to allow an outside party to get access like that. For those more tech savv

__label__0 DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS GAME, I was extreamly dissapointed. this is the most useless and boring app ever. to &quot;go to battle&quot; you just click a button and it tells u if u would have won. screw the Ppl who made this app.
__label__1 would be nice if you could just change your species in the game though.... other than that its all good
__label__1 Perfect for seeing those words that you just cannot pick up on with WWF. Nice transition between app & game. Really helpful. Love it.
__label__1 I love this app! I use it for Word with Friends (fair enough cause my opponents use it too) and I use it for lots of other applications too.
__label__1 This tool eliminates a lot of frustration.  While I don't use all the time but when I get all vowels or none well Love it.
__label__1 actually  now that the maker of this app has fixed the last update it works very well. It is certainly a help in Suggesting words better in your tile  board without actually cheating. There are many cheater Apps out there but if you were going to use tho
__label__1 I am awful with spelling and this app helps with that, I put in a word just to check spelling!
__label__1 Well, more like help w/ the jumble of letters you have in your hand.  Great help in tight spots (mostly brain drain...)  :-)
__label__0 I wasted $1.99 on this app just to get a &quot;no words found&quot; every single time I search for a word! This is no help when you are stuck at all! Not even worth the 1 star!!!! I WANT MY MONEY BACK!!!!!!!!

__label__1 I love the daily updates along with the weekly updates. I also like that I can record any symptoms or weight gain. There is community chat. This is a great pregnancy app, seems to go along with babycenter information. I check it all the time and stare at

__label__1 I have been using the free version of this app throughout my pregnancy.  It has good information.  Only wish that when my Droid X crashed, I could have re-installed the version I paid for.  I've tried to re-install through Amazon but it will not let me.

__label__1 Works on a Kindle Fire. You must have your PC on. Our printer is a Canon wireless and it works just fine.

__label__0 This app would not function properly on my Ainol Novo 7 tablet with Android 4.01 (Ice Cream Sandwich). Everything will come together eventually though. We're in a growing phase right now.  :&lt;)
__label__0 Cumbersome and didn't work with Samsung Printer as advertised. A little more truth in advertising would be greatly appreciated but I guess they are not the only app supplier to do it.
__label__1 works effortlessly for my Chromebook.  Must have my laptop running and my non-cloud printer up too.  Other than that, its fine. My next printer will be Cloud-print ready, so bye bye laptop.

__label__0 It lags when tapping the keys so the sound comes out late it has few keys so it it's hard to play songs with more notes it won't let me use 2 keys at once and it has a feeling of it was made at the last minute (?? ?? ??)
__label__0 Only has a few keys, Not fun! We were glad it was a free app. Thank you for letting us try it.

__label__1 This game is the closest thing to Bejeweled without the name! Great graphics and sounds. This beats the pants off off the other game with the same name! The other one sucks compared to this one. Just being brutally honest!
__label__1 I love this game....it seems I am always trying to find a little break in the day to play, then another break and another.
__label__0 I love Jewels Legend and have played through many times.  Wanted to try a different game but found this one lackluster after playing Jewels Legend.

__label__1 Any 3 match game is fun and jewels has them all. Addicting and exciting as it gets when playing these games. Keep up the good work on presenting these types of games.
__label__1 I use this a lot when I am crocheting. It helps me keep track of what row I am on. Great! But I have to keep my phone plugged in because the screen stays on. Small price to pay for such a great app.
__label__0 I don't like the fact that the phone will stay on so I don't have to unlock it to count the rows. I also don't like how it functions.
__label__1 This app is soo much easier than keeping tally marks on paper.  No worry of dropping your needle / hook to hunt and grab a pen, draw a tally mark, pick up your dropped needle /hook then resume your work.  Just tap the screen and resume.  Saves soo much t
__label__1 No more lost pegs on a traditional counter.  Just tap the screen of your Kindle to count another row completed.  The free version is just a big number that increments every time you tap a screen.  I can read it even without my glasses.If you knit items w

__label__1 This definitely goes to favorites on my Kindle Fire.I have fast access to Wikipedia instantaneously.Just compare to the speed on the regular website.

__label__1 This is absolutely stunning. I downloaded it for my 5 year old (who loves it) and I play with it as much as she does. The designs are endless and colors are amazing, plus you can save your work on your phone or tablet.
__label__1 Not in a negative way, mind you - sometimes you need to disconnect from reality, and this app allows me to do just that.Easy to use, and some of the designs you can make with it are really cool.
__label__1 This is by far the BEST drawing app I have seen!  I took me a bit to get the hang of it, but once I did...  Wow!  This is my new favorite app!!!
__label__1 This app is awesome! I downloaded it for my 5 year old son.  It's the same concept as the old magna doodles but in a more modern format.  Gone are the need for crayons and paper.  The best thing about this app is that it records your drawings and plays t
__label__1 Everyone should read this version - it is a loving, and a lovely read - well worth loading..., it is a permanent resident on my tablet
__label__0 THE MESSAGE book is just that. I thought it was another version of the bible but this could not be further from the truth. When it is compared with a true translation (and this is a paraphrased effort) it holds only a mild resemblance to the bible.

__label__1 This is a good time killer. I like the upgrades and the challenge of getting all perfect levels. I also like that you have to learn the best times to use the different bonuses.
__label__1 I love this game it is so much fun to play can barley pit it down I finished it in 3 days so much fun
__label__0 This app does anything but waste your time. It's also a waste of money and does not work very well.
__label__0 I've played this game on my desktop &amp; enjoyed it as well as sally's salon. But this app freezes my kindle to the point it shuts off &amp; may take a lil while to come back on! I'm so disappointed because sally's salon works fine on here.....all I can
__label__1 My friend recommended this game and I love it. Fun interaction game Wish there were more games like this one.

__label__0 I don't like that it is so small, even on the kindle. It is only half of the screen. It should be full screen like Sally 's Salon. I wish I had known it was so small before I paid for it.
__label__0 I wish I didnt have to give this app a bad review because its a nice looking app but it doesn't work very good.
__label__0 This app says its free but once you click on what card you want to make, it takes you to an app purchase where you have to buy it.:(

__label__1 The Bible is organized well and easy to find additional information as needed!  The other  publishers that are available are much more expensive and not worth the additional cost.  In general, I'm happy with this purchase.
__label__1 I currently have a hardback NIV as well as Wesley Study  NKJV and also a NLT.Having the NIV as an APP on the Kindle HD puts it at our fingertips.  We pick it up often and read it.
__label__1 Love this app. Especially for Bible studies and is amazing how easyit is to find passages of scripture and of course for making notes.
__label__1 I love that it doesn't require internet, and I can switch between NIV and KJV. It will hilight, bookmark, you can change the names of your bookmarks or just leave them as Book and Chapter, overall just a really great Bible! Definitely worth the money.
__label__1 I purchased this app also the King James version because it was more convenient than carrying two bibles to church. I prefer King James but my pastor preaches from NIV. I love that you don't need Wi-Fi to use.
__label__1 I use this app all the time you can download the bibles on your Kindle to use without internet connections.  Lester
__label__1 I love the King James Bible, and its cross references, however, when studying my Bible and I need it simplified for understanding, I can always read it in the NIV Bible.
__label__1 I absolutely love this app. It's perfect for using with my 1-year bible reading plan. I love how I can highlight any verses or passages, bookmark my place so I don't lose it, and underline stuff as well. I have the app for the BLUE as well by the same pr
__label__1 I love the Bible, but this version does not seem to have audio.  I like the audio so I can rest my eyes and hear the Bible being read to me.  Hope that this will have audio soon.  Also to have audio, a man's voice is better heard than a woman.  Many hard

__label__1 I enjoy using this Bible it is very easy to use. I love the note taking feature and the search and bookmarks features I would recommend it yo others.
__label__1 I like this app very much.It is very helpful to me because I wanted to know how to pray all the differentchaplets.
__label__1 This is exactly what I was looking for and the written prayers allows me to concentrate as I pray. Concentration is difficult at this time so this app is perfect for the Kindle Fire and Android phone.
__label__1 Like this app alot.  It has many different chaplets to choose from.  It has made my prayer life better when I can choose different prayers daily.
__label__1 It is a complete masterpiece designed by a higher power that is so cool it is breathtaking enough to mal some forward contemplations
__label__1 has all the chaplets that I use and then some all in one place! Makes it easy to find and pray so many devotions to Our Lady.
__label__0 Don't get this app. It is impossible to win. The zombies leave their coffins for about 2 seconds. You can't tell the angels from the zombies. I  can't beat mission 1. I was bored of it in 1 minute.
__label__1 CANT GET ENOUGH OF IT I THINK IT IS THE FUNNIEST GAME I HAVE PLAYED NOTHING ELSE TO SAY ABOUT IT
__label__0 This have sucks.I wouldn't recommend wasting memory on your device for it. It runs slow so you don't ever win.
__label__1 This app may not be free (today it is), but there is truth in the saying that you get what you pay for. On my Asus Transformer, it has a much more polished look over Google&apos;s app and renders much more smoothly. If you are into star gazing this is a 
__label__1 I wasn&apos;t sure what to expect with this but it totally blew my mind. The amount of information available and how easy it is to use mKes it a must have for any level of stargazer.
__label__0 major problem. don't bother to install. very disappointed because it used to be cool. comtacted support, but not expectong much.
__label__1 great star map application!  This application is beautiful and worth the money.  3 dollars is nothing to pay for this kind of application and really highlights the abilities of our smart phones.  this works well on tmobile g2 but not perfect, i can&apos;
__label__1 I have the new kindle fire hd 4g and this is great.  Enable the gps,bundle up your kids and find a spot away from lights and this handle app will help you find constellations ans planets in the night sky when you point your device in whatever direction y
__label__1 i&apos;ve always wanted to know more constallation. and now i can!  works great on my samsung galaxy! i dont mind the pictures.\n
__label__0 Star Chart doesn't seem to read the accelerometer correctly on the Kindle Fire -- it doesn't know which way the device is facing.In the absence of a GPS, it also refuses to work unless you manually type in a latitude and longitude.  It could get a very r
__label__1 This app is amazing. I&apos;ve had it for a couple of months now, and I use it all the time. It&apos;s AWESOME. I&apos;m so mad it&apos;s free today! I paid for it on the Android Market, but it sure was worth the money.
__label__1 i have used this app several times already to figure out what planet or constellation i'm seeing. this is a great app.
__label__1 such a phenomenal app that is enjoyed by all ages. Having the constellations on it makes it even more fun &amp; educational!
__label__1 This app is super sweet - it's a star map that knows what direction you're looking in. It was very helpful when I found myself trapped as a hostage on the planet known as Aagloorp in the Hath system. Luckily, I used this app to orient my star maps so whe
__label__1 Of course you have free Google Night Sky, but this app has better graphics,  more friendly controls, and a better interface for learning about constellations.  well done!
__label__1 I really love this app. its pretty, functional and I can also see stars under my feet ;) Thanks Amazon for giving out quality apps like this fo free.
__label__0 I have found this application to be terribly inaccurate. I had it pointed towards Orion and it was not showing it. I tried to change my time zone and it still didn&apos;t show it. Google Sky Map is WAY better. I do like how this program shows the graphic
__label__1 This is one of my favorite app's, I have always loved to look at the stars, with this program you get the names and information.
__label__1 very smooth and responsive map of the stars. Anywhere you point thetes lots of good info. It looks awesome on my honrycomb tablet
__label__1 I absolutely love this app!  The auto orientation and graphics are spectacular, and I just love using his at night.  Thanks for making this free today Amazon, and BIG thanks to the developer for an awesome app!
__label__0 I am really disappointed that this app is not working. I really wanted to try this app it must be awesome if the reviews are real and not posted by the developer. Please fix this app.It force closes every time I start it. Thanks Amazon for the free app o
__label__1 Great app. Might be redundant with sky map given free. Looks good on the Asus Transformer. Fun educational tool. The reviews are ridiculous. Seriously, people seem to have way too much time on their hands.
__label__1 A friend has a similar app on his iPad and it was partly why I wanted a tablet type phone (it works well on my Galaxy Note 2.)I have found many constellations I had difficulty identifying in the past.
__label__1 Very interesting and impressive application. The free app of the day rocks. I am in awe. The constellation images are a nice touch.
__label__1 Much nicer than googles, not a cooking app as someone else stated. I highly recommend this app, it is.pure quality.
__label__1 This astronomy app works great on my Acer Iconia A500 Tablet. Which by the way has a GPS, so the app automatically gets your location, then adjusts it's orientation. in respect to the direction you are facing.I have found it to be very accurate so far. A
__label__1 I admit I&apos;m a free app whore. I download them then never review them. This app deserves a review though. It has amazing graphics and works great on Thunderbolt. Like Google Earth only a million times better!! I wish I was a great reviewer but alas I
__label__1 the graphics are awesome and the detail of the celestial objects are awesome.  you can set your view location from any coordinate,  do wish you could do a city name or zip at least.
__label__1 A world apart from Google Sky.  Graphics are outstanding. Just touch a star and it&apos;s information pops up.  Thanks Amazon for this application.  DroidX 2.3.3
__label__1 This app is way better than Google Sky, in my opinion.  The graphics are great and the overlay of the constellations is a great touch.
__label__1 this app is amazing. it is very accurate and I can position it right over the stars. this must of taken some real time cuz the developer made it right. thanks a lot man. I hope u make many more apps or games for the android system. we are happy to have y
__label__0 I entered my lattitude and longitude after about 4 delete and re-installs because it kept taking away the decimal point (which btw, Moon Phases picked up just fine without any input from me) and now, it shows me about 3 starts if I point it up - it's a 2
__label__1 I&apos;m a big fan of Google Sky but this beats it.  Smoother movement, better graphics, and information for each star. It needs to use network location, not just GPS. It&apos;s also missing time travel. Otherwise just about perfect.
__label__1 Everyone I show this app to thinks it's really cool. great conversation starter.  if you ever wanted to know whhat you're looking at while looking at the night sky you should get this app.
__label__1 This is an easy to use and very useful app for anyone with a Kindle Fire and a desire to stargaze on a clear night.  It has a wide variety of settings that allow you to get just the right amount of information displayed so you can match the star map to w
__label__1 The app works beautifully on the ASUS Transformer (Honeycomb).  I started the app and began scanning the night sky from my brightly lit kitchen.  I can&apos;t wait to identify stars in the sky tonight. \n\nThanks to the developer for making this fun and 
__label__1 This is a very useful and beautiful app. I am really looking forward to using this app while camping! Very impressive.
__label__1 Metro PCS Samsung Galaxy Indulge (no root)\n\nThanks for the very informative reviews.\nSurprisingly, not too many whiners.\n\nAll issues other reviewers I read have, (lags, can&apos;t read text, jittery), I do not have with this phone. It&apos;s damn ne
__label__1 seems like a really good app. well laid out and easy to find constellations. I especially like the artwork as you line up the stars, it makes it easier to see what the constellations are.
__label__1 This App is awesome; it has a lot more to offer than Google Sky Map. The only issue I have is the lame description. It just seemed like the developer couldn&apos;t think of more to say so they just fluffed it out. &quot;State of the art GPS technologly..
__label__1 If you already use goolge sky map then don&apos;t let this ape pass by. It&apos;s makes a great addition to your google sky map.
__label__1 The 1st reviewer had me cracking up.  I really hope it was a joke. Otherwise I feel sad for them.  \nTo those who say that this is a rip off of the google version please just shut up.  This offers way more than that. If you like google better,  then use 
__label__1 This is a great shop, and free today, yay!  I&apos;ve had google sky, but the added beauty of the gorgeous illustrations congress those the winner in my book.  I can&apos;t wait to show my 5 year old daughter, she loved the google app, but as soon then a
__label__1 This is a fun little app! The quality is really very good, both in terms of the graphics and ease of use. This would probably be very good for some young kids too because it has a cool factor that would have them want to explore the stars
__label__1 You are in a univere surrounded by stars.  They are all around you...  Yes under your feet, albeit also behind (under) the planet you are standing on...  hence under your feet.
__label__1 Works great with my Evo 4G.  Love the subimposed art depicting constellations.  App was very bright and I found myself wishing for a night mode... sure enough, there it was.  Excellent job! Love this app.
__label__1 This app benefits from the GPS chip that is on (and only on), the Kindle Fire HD 8.9 4G Lte. As others have commented, other Kindle models do not have GPS, BUT the new Kindle Fire HD 8.9 4G Lte DOES! The app quickly obtained my location from the GPS chip
__label__1 The Asus Transformer has GPS, so setting location is a breeze. And it has a compass so turning around would orient the display to show the correct part of a sky (just make sure you don't have this in a case with a magnetic clasp). It works in landscape m
__label__1 I know Google Sky Maps is free, but it has nothing on this!Star Chart is downright beautiful! I homeschool my kids &amp; have used Google Sky before to  try to make learning about the stars more interesting. It didn't make much difference...just showed t
__label__1 great little app so worth it much better than Google similar offerings.Fun to check where things are around all above our heads
__label__0 last update broke this app. no longer works and restarts my phone. please fix, I love this app. Mytouch 4g
__label__1 The product now works with correct orientation on my gTablet.  Please note, my tablet does not have a built-in compass so it will not automatically orient the star charts based on the direction the tablet is facing, but that is the fault of the tablet an
__label__1 Beautifully made and fully functional. Breathtaking graphics with smooth fading mechanic for the constellation drawings. Would give more stars if I could:)
__label__1 First time opening application on my DROIDX app force closes. This had me worried but 2nd time it opened no problem. Had to have gps &amp; vzw networks on in location settings in order for app to find me. Didn&apos;t seem to entirely match my movements w
__label__1 I have a 6 year old grandson that loves the stars and moon could not wait to get this so I could show it to him and he loves it we are thinking about getting him is own type of ereader that he can have this on his own best buy yet for my new Kindle Fire.
__label__1 Wow, so pretty! Google stars is nice but this has a few advantages, one of which that I ready appreciate its an overlay of the cancellations so you can see how its represented.  Will get lots of use out of this I&apos;m sure!
__label__1 Top notch first rate app that accurately uses the GPS to display the skies above you.It's amazing how accurately it displays stars, planets, constellations etcEasily moves to SD card as ANY good app should!Well worth the $2.99 a steal as the free app of 
__label__1 Bought this after getting a competitor's app. Found this to be superior. Only problem is that when using a time other than current, must use GMT. For Chicago area that means adding 5 hours currently (CDT). Other than that and the inability to show fainte
__label__0 This app is a rip off of googles skymap.  The developer had nothing revolutionary about this program and the reviews are ludicrously fake.  Android apps are becoming redundant, theres always some joker trying to charge money for free &quot;water&quot;.
__label__1 I really love this app because I can hold my phone up when I see a constallation that I might not know, and it'll tell me what it is! Also, I love the fact that for example, I'm looking at Leo, it'll show a very detailed picture of a lighted up lion arou
__label__1 best star chart! so clear with line drawings then, pretty art so its not just Ursa minor in lines, there is a white,swirly bear illustration, very beautifully drawn.
__label__1 Tons of options, smooth animation and works better than Google's.  Takes a little longer to start up, but worth it for the performance.
__label__1 First off, congrats to Amazon for FINALLY implementing some level of hardware control. If you cannot download or install this app it is because your device is not supported. Amazon did let you download it before so that if you bought a better phone in th
__label__1 It is nice to be able to look up all the constellations that I know but can't remember the names of. Plus it looks nice and is very easy to use.
__label__0 why buy this or even n consider it when Google sky already exists? seems odd to pay for a similar app
__label__0 I could not get the location to work.  Holding it up to the sky didn't work.  It was very disappointing.
__label__1 It's accurate and fun...I haven't taken time to use it much...need nine more words...don't know what else to say  :-)
__label__1 Stable app that seems to work well and very accurate.  I enjoy using it on the back porch. The night setting makes it turn red to help with viewing the app and the stars with little eye adjustment.  My kids like to point out stars and have me tell them i
__label__1 I was not expecting such a beautiful app. The graphics are stunning. My 5 year old son is beside himself now, as we were trying it out, he said, &quot;I wish there was a giraffe up there.&quot;, then all of the sudden, we saw one! He literally hugged my 
__label__0 When Amazon fixes that I guess I would rate this higher. I&apos;m sure there will be people saying they downloaded it fine, but there is no option to get the app on my screen.
__label__1 I went outside and couldn&apos;t see any stars because of light pollution, so rated this app one star. J\/K. \n\nThis is a neat little app that directs you around the night sky based on your physical location. It just works. You can turn on and off label
__label__1 I don&apos;t know if it&apos;s the built in gyroscope, but this thing is buttery smooth and the graphics are light years ahead of Google Sky! I guess as long as your phone has the right hardware, the experience is second to none!
__label__1 Simply stunning graphics and easy to use. Many Kindle Fire users seem to have issues, but the new Kindle Fire HD tablet has GPS so it works great! The price is right at .99&cent; and you won't be disappointed!
__label__0 the program loads and installs but is about as accurate as drunken blind man trying to shoot a moving target.not happy spending money on something that doesnt work on the andriod fire, mostly because there isnt any warning before purchasing.  i place tha
__label__1 This app is very relaxing to look at, kind of like watching tropical fish or a lava lamp. I personally think it&apos;s better than the Google one because it has pictures of the constellations, not just the names and locations.\n\nThe only problem I&apos;
__label__0 i shouldn't have bought this ...i should have read the fine print. it is not compatible with my fire. I thought i could go out and point it at the stars and it would tell me what i was looking at. My fault though. it might be a great download for the rig
__label__1 Works great on my Samsung Fascinate!  Looks SO much better than Google Sky and seems to be a bit more accurate when pointed in a direction (NSEW).  Love it!
__label__1 This is a very nice looking app and has similar features to sky except this is much more detailed.  Runs very smooth on the HTC G2.
__label__1 I was looking for an inexpensive guided meditation for my Kindle Fire, and I've purchased others at the Amazon store, but this is by far the best guided meditation I've found, and I only paid about $2 - can't beat it.
__label__1 It makes sense to me to purchase meditation apps from a company that specializes in this type of product.  That being said this app is a kite meditation that does exactly as advertised.  If you need a more structured deeper meditation product I'd advise 
__label__1 No fancy script...just gentle suggestions to let your mind go in a soft and calming voice....I fall asleep before it end every time.
__label__0 I don't recall purchasing this item so I find it odd that I would have a review pending for me to write.
__label__1 Very, very nice way I start my day. You can set various times to suit you preferences, and the voice is very soothing to make you just clear your mind. Mediation is about being in the moment. I love being quiet and being able to have no thoughts running 
__label__1 I found this to be so relaxing I was in a almost sleep Others mentioned a lack of directions for breathing etc.  For me I liked not having to focus on all that. It distracts me and puts a &quot;performance&quot; stress on the mind. I love this app for it
__label__1 This is great for destressing your day.  Actually I have listened to this three times in one day.  I am a cancer survivor, sometimes daily activities can be stressful.  I find this app is very helpful in guiding me to a more relaxing state of being.  I r
__label__1 This app is great for a middle of the day recharge!  You can set it for 5, 10, or 20 minutes. No sleepy hypnosis, just relaxation a refocus of your awareness.  Highly recommend!
__label__1 I used where a while back on my Palm Pre and didn't like it.  This version is way better a year later.  It can replace gas finding or movie search apps and for someone who has limited space on their phone that is a big help.
__label__0 I downloaded this application and was going to save my favorite restaurants to the list so that "Where" could find similar restaurants and I could try them out. I typed in and also did a search by category of my favorite places. Only two out of fifteen w
__label__1 First off, the UI is amazing on My Galaxy tab. It runs smooth, looks great &amp; overall is simply just great. Cant complain. :)
__label__1 Wow, not sure what more I can really say than this app really does exceed all of my expectations!! I already had an app that read the Bible out loud (Cross Connect), which I really love, so i debated even trying this one. I decided to give the free versi
__label__1 I'm very happy with this app, ended up buying it shortly after downloading the free version.  I hope the Old Testament will be released soon!
__label__1 A great and easier way to use the bible. I absolutly love it. A great use in bible school activities.
__label__1 Education and entertainment in a superbly crafted app.I highly recommend. You will have a new appreciation for scripture. Do not have reservations with regard to the price. Works very well on Kindle Fire.
__label__0 Spreading the word is what we r suppose to do. Not asked to be paid for it. Cant buy your way to heaven.  Ignorant!
__label__0 I don't know why I downloaded the app...didn't use it for long. Now I have an iPhone and don't need it.
__label__1 This app works great on my DROID X. I have a message saved for when Im driving or in the movie. Will add more when the situation comes up. I recommend this app.
__label__1 why do people give such horrid reviews for an app that does what its suppose to do.No issues so far. works great when I work all day and can&apos;t respond to people.
__label__1 This ape is great for when you&apos;re out. On a date, late at night and if you&apos;re in a movie. It beats ignoring calls and texts! No force closes and seems reliable. Good amount of options.
__label__1 I hate it when people lower the review (stars) when the app does not have a feature that they think of, but the app does not claim to have it.a true review is rating the app for the features it claims to have. you can always contact the developer and ask
__label__1 i installed this and a leprechaun texted me a weird message. immediately I was able to ignore it now and my family is free from the leprechaun terrorists... thanks dev!!!
__label__1 I appreciated this app that Farmer's Insurance has that allows you to send a text out if you are on the move, but it has a bunch of other features that I didn't want causing it to move into bloatware. So it is nice to see an app dedicated to auto-respond
__label__1 if you are using go SMS, you must uncheck &quot;disable other message notification &quot; this cause problems when reading text messages. when I unchecked it, it now runs flawlessly!! I hope you guys read this. this app rocks!
__label__0 Seriously?  Friggin wait until you get somewhere.  You need an auto reply while driving?  Turn off your txt plan and learn to live in the real world.
__label__0 i trying messing with it and it doesnt even work, i tried and tried. i installed it and uninstalled it and again no good, sorry :-/hope this review helps.
__label__1 This app does exactly what it sets out to do.  I love having this on for when I'm driving or watching a movie in theaters or just at home spending time with family.  You can rest assured knowing that you're not completely blowing anybody off.  No more wo
__label__1 This app is excellent.  Does just what I need it to do.  Lets you enter your own message.  I use it driving and when I'm busy and can't be bothered.Someone complained it didn't let them choose callers they didn't want it to apply to. Duh, then don't use 
__label__1 I sleep during the day and all the ladies hate it when I can&apos;t hear my text message ringtone. Now I can turn on this great program, tell my ladies im sleeping and all is good!Im so happy amazon made this app the free app of the day.*rooted evo 4g w/
__label__1 This app is a genius idea. I love it and turn it on when I&apos;m asleep or at work. Works perfectly on my Droid 2. It even has a widget you can &quot;add&quot; for easy access.
__label__1 This app is great, works exactly as described every time, never had a problem, never crashes, great to let people know why you're not responding to texts.  Perfect for gym/work outs, meetings, class, job, or whenever you're away from your phone!
__label__1 Full customizable auto-reply messages are what I needed for my phone to reply to for text-messages or phone calls while I'm working or otherwise busy. That's what I got with this. It was the Free App of the Day on August 21, 2011 and I downloaded it afte
__label__1 using this app has really helped relieve stress, feeling like you have to reply with an excuse as to why you are late to reply. also, the customization of messages allows for greater freedom than other apps.only thing may be to apply it to other services
__label__1 I have used the Lite version for some time, and found it very useful. With the full version, you can create you own away messages. I will continue to use this every day.
__label__0 Did not care for this app, no special reason, just did not like it. Didn't like the features or the way it worked. Better Video poker games out there.
__label__0 for free OK but if you have to purchase it.....don't do it......I had great hopes but it is proving boring.
__label__1 want a simple fun poker game to play around with-try this out for a bit.  offers fast response and good graphics and something easy to play around with.  worth a shot and trying.  doesn't seem to freeze up or anything like some games like this do.
__label__0 Another waste of time, not really free. not enough money to start with. You will have to spend money to0 wi8n at this game, and lot's of it.
__label__1 Fun way to lose your money your fake money try to out wit the dealer but its a long shot and no risk so lets play cards im feeling lucky
__label__1 It's just like the real thing---I can never win! LOL This is a good game for when you just want to sit down for a few minutes at a time. Great for a busy person.
__label__1 I'M ENJOYING PLAYING OLD SCHOOL POKER.  IT'S WHAT I NORMALLY PLAY WHEN WE GO TO THE CASINOS.  THE ONLY DRAW BACK IS IT DOESN'T KEEP YOUR  CREDITS WHEN YOU SHUT DOWN.  EACH TIME YOU OPEN THE GAME YOU START WITH 100 CREDITS, BUT IT'S FUN AND KEEPS ME ENTER
__label__1 I was looking for a simple video poker game, and I found it with Free Old School Video Poker. Very straight forward, easy to use with a couple of cool options. Giving you hours of entertainment. Wait! did I mention it was FREE!
__label__1 I like video poker and this game is my favorite.  I can't stop playing it. I'm getting better at it all the time.
__label__1 Good game....win or lose as much as any other game of poker......nice fast and efficient game on my Kindle. Kills time as well as any other.
__label__0 I have always liked playing video poker....Deuces Wild...Joker Poker...Jacks or Better...etc...BUT....this game is so lame...No Action... so B-O-R-I-N-G !I would not recommend
__label__0 who gives this a five star and then says it make you cooler!!!!!!! if I ever see that guy he'll be in prison for selling illegal drugs!! don't get this app even if it's on a device
__label__0 You cant even control the smoke coming out this is a waste of space don't even bother.(m.styk that was a horrible review)
__label__0 smoking is bad 4 u. it downy mmake you cool and it downy get you anywere, it dosnt do anything even get you high
__label__0 this sucks. i thought kids should b learning not to smoke. this app should b taken of the amazon store, it should b illigle or something.  smoking can give u lung cancer do u rlly want ur kids to have that?!?do me and everyone a FAVOR-DONT GET THIS APP!!
__label__0 what the heck whoever said smoking was cool and kids should do it was dropped on their head when they were born and should have a brain transplant!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! it is bad for you it causes lung cancer!!!!!!!!!!!! this app needs to be illegal along with
__label__1 Nothing beats a good game of Voltaire. Great for passing time! Easy on the eyes and brain. Try it...you'll like it. Can't lose the cards and you don't have to deal!
__label__1 I consider myself a pretty knowledgeable person but this application has showed me. The wealth of information and ease of use are unparalleled. Even my non-tech savvy wife loves it. Highly recommend it!!!
__label__0 Lame tips.  Here's  a secret way to make money, create a crappy app, charge two bucks, pad it with good reviews, and your off.  I hope this simple if an app hasn't made the dev much money. It sucks, useful maybe for a first time droid user for the first 
__label__0 app exists solely to prey on people with android ignorance. These &quot;secrets&ldquo; are more like tips that any simple Google search can reveal. Honestly there is no need for something like this..... most things are just common sense with android. Do 
__label__1 couldn't communicate after a having several teeth pulled, program works well, instead of needing to type out something and turn to show them.  I didn't need wifi to download; was able to get it on the ride home.  it is a great free app!  Thank you very m
__label__0 the app worked just okay.  automatically filled in some words incorrectly.  left it running for a minute without typing and got a full screen ad full of pornography.  surprise! glad I didn't download it for a child to use.
__label__1 This is great. My little sister cannot really talk yet so this is great. Parents, if your child is not talking yet this app is great to get them talking love it
__label__0 I believe Droid Talker- Free is a very &quot;interesting&quot; app. The first thing I noticed about this app is the layout. The background was all white and these annoying advertisements kept on showing up and asking me to go to different sites and many 
__label__1 this is awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! buy it Its free!!!!!!TTYLXOX!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!see me on better games yep I'm on the good games for a comment tell me ur favorite hams on here right now k!TTYLXOXw
__label__1 I cant talk so it works really good for me and now I dont have to do sight Langwage so its good for me to not talk bye
__label__1 I love this app. I can type anything I want and it will say it. We have so much fun with this app at work.
__label__1 This is a fun app that you can use when you're bored. I don't know why people are complaining about inappropriate ads, because I don't see any. I highly recommend this app.
__label__1 haha u type in whatever u want this is. like the inner me n u can annoy Ppl with this
__label__1 This app downloaded well and worked very fine for me on my Kindle Fire.  No problems what so ever.Please categorize this as a communication device app instead of a game.When I looked for "Text to speech" app for my autistic child I got this one.  Thanks 
__label__1 I bought text2speech first, thinking that if all else failed that I could unlock reviews. Sometimes Droid Talker - free doesn't speak clearly and the words become garbled, but for for a free app this is an excellent replacement for your voice if it is ou
__label__1 This helps my autistic son repeat words for me. I tpye a word and he listens and repeats. Nice little app and I cannot find anything bad to say about. No problems and I have used it for about 3 weeks now. I thought it was an assisant app like the IPhone 
__label__1 THIS IS HILARIOUS! My family and I really enjoy this app. Very funny in the monotone voice. GET THIS APP, NOW!!!!
__label__0 i thought u could do something fun but no.......it sucks booty......dont ever get this stupid app......dont care wat someone says it is the worst app ever!!!!!
__label__1 this game is so much fun everybody should get it!!!!!! if I could rate this 10 stars I would for sure!!!! ;)
__label__1 really fun to mess with people or iff you have a talking disorder or mouth issue its handy overall awesome app
__label__1 I got this app to communicate with my husband while suffering from a horrific tooth infection. It does mispronounce some words but, after getting to know the app, I started spelling certain words and phrases phonetically and that solved the problem. Anyo
__label__0 Fun for like 2 sec. and then it just gets boring and dumb. Buy this app only if you are willing to spend money for crap.
__label__0 This is the most useless app yet-on the Kindle Fire you can't change the picture unless you un-install the app and reinstall it. There is not button for saving the picture. Waste of time. Very frustrating for toddlers. Don't bother
__label__1 my kids are having fun with this one.so one of my kids love art so she doing all kinds of stuff with it.
__label__1 My grandchildren love this game! Their imagination goes wild as they draw and color on the screen. And the best thing about Computer Painting - There is no paint spill mess to clean up afterwards!
__label__0 Just like reviews before mine have stated, it incorrectly marks mines and in some cases doesn't put numbers next to mines where numbers should be. If I could give it 0 stars, I would! I downloaded this game a long time ago but never played it until now a
__label__1 Mine sweeper!! There are games in our lives that will forever hold a near and dear spot in our childhood. Pacman, Zelda, Final Fantasy, Mortal Combat and Many more but Mine Sweeper fits in there with all of them. The play Is perfect but I am do favor cla
__label__0 Kindle Fire hd 8.9"This is my original review after I just DL game but I was wrong! The game has lots of bugs, putting flags down and clicking when a flag was supposed to be put there. I tried a few times thinking it was me but in the end I had to uninst
__label__1 How can you not love mine sweeper.  Makes my brain actually think! I love it. This game will never get old. Worth it
__label__0 First time listening, there were pleads for donations. I already bought the app! Major fail! Just play the radio shows and don't try to bleed me alnymore--especially a paying customer. Pass on this one. Sorry I wasted the money, even if it was only $1.99
__label__1 I've been enjoying this app so much. It's been a connection that I can talk about with my parents and they get a luck out of it too. So far I haven't experienced any problems with the app.
__label__1 I love the Johnny Dollar adventures and there are a lot more shows to listen to. Thank you Adam Graham for all your hard work!
__label__1 I have an internet radio I listen all the time to old time radio shows suspense detective stories etc this is great now I am more mobilegreat library
__label__1 Because 10 is better than 9.  One two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen.
__label__1 This is a very complete and easy to use financial calculator. The graphics are large, easy to see and use.
__label__1 I don't have the time for a complete review. I agree with what all the great reviews have said.  A few people who put that the calculator was&amp;#34;too confusing&amp;#34; or thought it was a normal calculator need to be flicked in the head. Writing thi
__label__1 Great calculator app. No bugs or miscalculations like apps in the past by other developers.I like how this developer took the time to reply to people and address concerns about network access etc. I wish people who thumped this app with 1 star reviews ba
__label__1 This is definitely a five-star app.  Definitely worth downloading (even when it's not free).The display is clean and had the look/feel of the HP calculator upon which it is based (absent the raised buttons for course).  It is also, to the relief of many,
__label__1 I've used advanced calculators since back in the day when they cost hundreds of dollars and actually had LED displays instead of LCD. I bought my first TI scientific calculator in an electronics store in Manhattan that was "going out of business". LOL I 
__label__0 Program kept stopping which probably was a good thing. Definitely not for the amateur in that it is not intuitive.
__label__1 It's great you can do just about anything with it and then some so I use it a lot just about everyday.
__label__1 Probably the best FAOTD calculator thus far.Please ignore the bogus reviews using stong words like spyware. The developer actually took the time to leave them comments and adressed their concerns but they ignored him.
__label__0 I just updated my phones O/S and discovered THIS APP WON'T WORK UNLESS YOU'RE LOGGED INTO YOUR APPSTORE ACCOUNT.I uninstalled 10bil Calc since there are plenty of Calculator apps that don't require me to be logged into my Appstore for simple day-to-day c
__label__1 Works just like the real thing.  No problems with or without internet access.  It's getting a bum rap from some.
__label__1 This is a professionally designed and functional financial calculator for your tablet or smart phone.  I installed it onto an Android tablet and a Kindle Fire without any issues.  The calculator is a copy of the HP10BII which makes it ideal for people in
__label__1 This app is better than a lot of the others I've tried. I took a finance class before I found this app. I wish I saw it earlier
__label__1 5 stars because maybe it has to be usefull to others, I just downloaded because it was a FAOTD and may be one day I will use it but for now I can't even look at it again cuz me brain died. :)
__label__0 I downloaded the program and when I tried to open it a error message showed up.  I tried to download it the second time and it told me only one download per customer.  So as of now I have no comment on how it works.
__label__0 I am looking through my files for an old calculator bought from the Wall Street Journal.This calculator has the same/very familiar functions. I can use that manual to operate this
__label__1 This is a nearly identical clone of a real HP 10BII calculator. I've been using a real one for years and it's pretty close to breathtaking for a nerd like me to now have this on his Tegra2 tablet.BONUS: This is SO close to the real thing that the actual 
__label__1 Even though you may have no immediate need for a complicated calculator like this, as a FOTD 6 dollar application,  you may want to download it as a "who knows,  maybe one day will need it."  It's a little more than 9mb in size and approx 46 - 50mb in RA
__label__1 what a fantastic app. the calculator alone is very useful, although very complicated. But the easy setting makes it so even a novice could figure it out.  All in all, very useful
__label__1 its good at hiding things and so discreet!!!also on my kindle fire I use it to organize my picture into separate files instead of just &quot;downloaded&quot;.that is my faveoeite part about this app!!! ^_^
__label__1 Very nice hide app. No one knos that its hide app all my friend think its audio manager app. No hidden files r seen in sd card manager. m very happpy :))
__label__0 Hidden apps still show in the market. They also still show in the settings -&gt; applications list. This app also shows in the market as well.
__label__1 Ironically I really use it to adjust my sound levels.Of course the hidden file part works great as well.
__label__1 its a must have for hiding pictures videos audios and you can only hide apps if your device is rooted which is the only downfall
__label__1 I found this to be an easy to use and quite useful application.  Not only does it provide a means of blocking the view of almost any thing you can consider, it also can control the audio output of your Android device.  Get it!
__label__1 This app is really handy, and I also use it on my phone. On my phone I also use it for my texting, as opposed to the stock texting app.
__label__0 You can't hide apps without root access, which really sucks. Would rate 0 stars if I could. Uninstalled. Lock instead.
__label__1 I've tried several different apps like this one, trying to find one that worked well.  I came across Hide It Pro when my phone OS updated and the app I was didn't support the new version.  I'm glad, as this one is far better in pretty much every way.  Fi
__label__1 why wouldn't you love a program that keeps your private stuff private. it hides things perfectly, and it has a hidden browser too. I recommend this program whole heartedly!
__label__1 have the paid version on my phone. been using this app for about 2 years now.  5 star app. excellent
__label__1 This is a well thought out application with a straight forward, easy to use interface.  Definitely a Top 10 and Must Have application!
__label__0 Could not figure out how it works plus I don't trust it.
__label__1 Works great on my Kindle Fire 1st generation!  Better than I expected and I highly recommend to anyone wanting to make pictures, videos, etc. private!
__label__0 this froze my kindle I had to buy a new one don't get it you'll regret this dumb whet app
__label__0 I have this on my sons EVO &amp; it has the ability to lock apps with a password. I got that from Google Market, but the Kyros tablet i have for our other son, which can't have Market. So I was happy to see it here, but it's missing the ability to lock a
__label__1 the one thing I would change is that mine comes up as hide.it pro for the title you should change the name to audio manager or volume controller or something like tht
__label__1 Pleasantly surprised, the app appears as audible manager in your list. Very easy to use, I have not tried the encryption Icon yet, I wanted to use it to hide my erotic lit but the file names are gibberish I 'm having difficultly recognizing my books, but
__label__1 i love it is so cool to use it make me feel like a spy with the secret thing it so cool and fun to use.
__label__0 If you're trying to hide porn on your Kindle Fire, an app called Hide It is not a very subtle place to put it, innocuous musical note logo or no.
__label__1 This little app gives you an excellent stop watch with multiple lap times as well as a basic stop timer functionality.  Very friendly interface and super functional!
__label__1 Beautiful app, beautifully done. love the option to toggle verbal responses.  The developer certainly didn't skimp on the extras.  thanks for making it free.  Great job!
__label__1 excellent app for timing and stop watch options. useful for my work and personal use. I love it and will use it often.
__label__1 Installed on my kindle fire, it works very nicely. I particularly like the count-down voice - perfect for those timed party games.
__label__1 UltraChron is an easy to use stopwatch and timer, which I have been using both on my phone and tablet for a long time. The controls and navigation are intuitive and easy to use.I have Version 1.9.2 Installed on my tablet. It is showing a Total storage of

__label__1 I find this app useful for estimating the arrival of my refunds. It helps to know about when the money will arrive. It is also nice to know when my returns have been processed. I download this every year!
__label__1 I had had an issue with identity theft, so I wasn't really expecting this app to give me an actual time frame for my refund. I was so wrong! It was right about the day I filled and even the time! As for the time frame, I will update this review when I re
__label__1 This app gives you current information, less hassle than using irs website, if you filed your taxes using TurboTax but no state information giving.
__label__1 This app is very simple not much too it but I guess that's the beauty of it. I don't like the fact that I have to enter my social but at the same time it makes it safer.
__label__1 This app was EXACTLY what I was looking for! It does EXACTLY what it says, nothing more and nothing less. Simply elegant in it's simplicity. Thank you!
__label__1 This is a very useful tool to have. It worked quickly without making my phone crash, and it's very easy to use.
__label__1 This app was extremely easy to use. I think a first grader could do it. No problem downloading it. Also, it's free. Get it today!
__label__1 I used this app to track my refund as I use Turbo-tax yearly. Didn't have much interface as my taxes processed in record time. But, what I did use worked very well.
__label__0 Don't waste your time!  No real information that you can't already get from your tax software.  Save the time and space and don't bother.
__label__1 I am very satisfied with this product. I've been using TorboTax for years and the Track My Refund for three years. I've always gotten the maximum refund allowed and this year, I finished in about ten minutes after I got everything ready to begin. Highly 
__label__1 It's certainly to the point. It's a simple app and pretty hard to screw up. I just wish turbo tax gave you more info on your state refund status though, on either the web our this app.
__label__1 Keep track if the status of your return and when you can expect to get it. So easy to use
__label__1 Quick and easy. Don't have any thing more to say. Don't have any thing more to say. Woo hop! Yay!
__label__1 This is a very simple app designed to do nothing more than track your e-filing and refund. In this case, simple works. It's quite user-friendly and the status update is immediate. It's a great way to keep on top of your tax return's status.
__label__1 I used Turbo Tax for the first time this year because my bank offered a free version on their site.  When I was done and picked up my Kindle Fire, this app showed up as a "recommended" product.  So I bought it.I am so glad I did. I check the status all t
__label__1 like it.  It does what it is suppose to do. Yes, I like it a whole lot. I like it.
__label__1 I loved how quick and easy this was. Just take a pic fill out a couple other things and literally SNAP your done! :-D $25 to file and it was admitted the same day within mins.
__label__1 Finished my taxes yesterday using TurboTax (on my PC), opened this app on my Kindle Fire this morning, and very easily can see the status of my Tax Returns. Simple!
__label__1 Works perfect, just enter  SSN and zip code, and it tells you your current status!  I would definitely recommend this to a friend.
__label__0 I am not going to keep tellong people I had a very bad experience with them and if you went through my ordeal you would hate it too. Should have stuck to H& R Block
__label__1 ...and quick and matter-of-fact.No bells+whistles.It does exactly what it promises to do which is, in my opinion, admirable.
__label__1 It took all of 15 seconds for me to get up-to-date information on the status of my refund.  Just like the version on my laptop.  I recommend this app.
__label__1 This app makes it so easy to check on your tax returns. I use it daily until my money is in the bank!
__label__1 I use TurboTax every year to do my taxes.  It easy and hassel free.  So, when I did my taxes this year, I was happy to see an app that I could download onto my Kindle Fire.  I was able to check up on my tax return with ease.  Worked perfectly!
__label__0 Even after I received an email from TurboTax stating that my refund was on its way, this software continued giving me updates from the previous year. Waste of time.
__label__1 The app was very easy to use.since I used turbo tax to do my taxes simply entering my social security number and date of birth got me instant update on my status. Easy to use.
__label__1 I recommend this service to anyone who needs to file their taxes because it is not necessary to pay when its so easy to file. Even i could do it.
__label__1 Great app. Very easy to use. Loved it!! I've used TaxAct for years, but this time around I opted for Turbo Tax and I'm happy I did.
__label__1 The title says it all, but because of the word minimum I will add that the app is one of the easiest you'll ever use. Much thanks.
__label__1 Very easy to use.  Use it to check on status without having to make phone calls or submitting loads of erroneous data.I am plaesed with the simplicity
__label__1 Simple.  It works. More does not need to be said, except these reviews are required to have at least twenty unique words.
__label__1 Plug in your numbers and bingo bango you have an answer. I'm not saying that it is the answer but it is a answer.
__label__1 Easy to use, and quick response.  I would recommend this app to anyone that wants to check the status of their e-filing as well as when they can expect to see their refunds.
__label__1 Been filing with Turbo Tax for 15 years problem free.  Now there is a fast, safe way to check on your refund. Get the MyTaxRefund app for TT!
__label__1 This does exactly what it says it does. Much easier than turning on the computer and logging on to Tutbo Tax to get the information. I'm glad I saw this and got it.
__label__1 Love it, and I think it's just a great app. I don't think I will use any other app other than this on. Intuit you're great.
__label__1 It is so nice to be able to track your refund and see when it is deposited in the bank.  Thank you
__label__0 This app sucks! It gave me wrong information and when I emailed them to tell them that I was told that I needed to update the app. Guess what what there is no way to download an update. If you want accurate information about the status of your tax refund
__label__1 Filing our taxes with TurboTax was one of the easiest and quickest ways we have ever filed taxes before. The step by step directions were awesome and so easy to follow it was unbelievable. We will never again do our taxes any other way. If you have never
__label__1 It kind of feels funny to put in such sensitive info into a mobile app, but it really wouldn't be much different than doing the same thing on the computer where I did it to file my taxes.It works and even gives an estimated date for refund if you're due 
__label__1 Fabulous product. Would recommend it to family and friends. I used it last year and will continue to use it in years to come.
__label__1 Simple, fast, to the point. Lets you know where your return is. Does what it says it will. I was pleased to see that it's a free app, since turbotax usually charges for everything.
__label__1 This is a nifty little app to have when you want to know when you might be expecting your tax refund.  i don't like the fact that you have to provide your SSN as part of the retrieval, but I do understand that it is necessary in order to find your tax re
__label__1 Great app for checking on your tax refund. It really helps to be able to track your tax refund as it makes its way to the IRS.
__label__1 We have used TurboTax for several years. We are very satisfied with the ease of completing our returns. We efile and get our refunds quickly. I know I have utilized all the options available for us. I get to print out the form and it remembers it all to 
__label__1 I love turbo tax. I have filed with them for years and never had a problem. This app makes knowing when your money is coming so simple and its actually more convenient than the "where's my refund" that the irs offers. Get it. Use it. Be satisfied. It's t
__label__1 This is a very slick little application. It is very quick and straight forward. Easy to use! The price is right.
__label__1 Convienent way to check on the status of your refund. Just enter sen and zip and your status instantly appears.
__label__1 I have used Turbo Tax for the last 15 or so years and trust them exclusively.  It is a great app and your security is protected.
__label__1 I loaded this the same night that I filed and within a few minutes my federal return was accepted..  With this app I can check the status anytime anywhere.  Great app.  Thank.s Turbo Tax
__label__1 Intuit is a great company who listens to its public. Always innovative and like its name intuitive. I've been an Intuit fan since DOS!
__label__0 i decided to not use this app so I deleted it from my Kindle.  I have no idea what it does but if you need it, it is free so give it a try.
__label__1 This is a nice, quick, lightweight application from Intuit, the makers of Turbo Tax, and Quicken.  It quickly finds and report the status of your return.  Only, I'm not sure why to keep it past April 15th.
__label__1 Downloaded this free app on a whim. It works exactly as is stated. You just plug in some info, and it gives you an estimate on when your refund is on its way. Works well on my kindle, no bugs. If you're curious to find out when your refund is on its way,
__label__1 I choose this rating because I filed my taxes through TurboTax and this app is awesome for anyone who used them to file taxes!
__label__1 I have used turbo tax for a few years now. A lot better than spending a hundred bucks. This has proven accurate!
__label__1 This app is easy to use and it only gives me the information I want, at a glance. No mucking around with excess information our images, it tells you what you wanted the app for any way.
__label__1 Love this app love being able to track where and when I might get my refund. Simple to use just like turbo tax I have used it for years and will again.
__label__1 Great app for tracking tax return. It works flawlessly and it's up to date. I love turbo tax they stay innovative and the tracking app is a great addition.
__label__1 I always do my taxes with Turbo Tax because of how user friendly it is and makes even me looks smart.  I always like to go online to check on my refund status for one reason or another and his app lets me check the status on my Kindle Fire just as easy.
__label__1 I was really nervous when I found out that the IRS was delaying so much this year, but with this app I found out before I even got the email that it was accepted and the app was so easy to use.
__label__0 This app honestly will not work this year as the Irs has changed its system.  They no longed give dates but just say within 21 days so turbo tax has no idea and are just making up a rough date.
__label__1 I like Sudoku and this app is great and doesn't have any bugs or glitches. I highly recommend it to anyone.
__label__1 A challenging game, which will preoccupy your mind and help you relax your mind andsharper your ability to analyse situations.
__label__0 Although the appearance of the game is great, it doesn't work very well, at least on the Kindle Fire. Once you turn on the hints, you can't turn them back off. It has an auto check feature, but you can put all the same number in a row or column and it do
__label__1 This app is simple to use. My children ages 3 and 9 have mastered it. The 3 year old loves it and I've learned so much about him and his needs. Without this app our communication gap would have been severed.I realized that he understood so much more than
__label__1 My daughter's teachers use this in the classroom. I was very excited to see that it is avalible for the kindle fire! Now we will be able to get them for both autistic preschools
__label__1 I tell it all the time to say wakey stuff it says stuff so funny just love it!!!!!!!?! so rad
__label__1 so awesome I used it on my friends I pad when we went to Monteray bay and got it on my kindle fire
__label__1 This is a great starter application for anyone who has language difficulties.  My son has autism. I hope to teach him to use this program to help him have another way to communicate. The basic version is free!
__label__0 This lite version is a waist of time. It is very hard to make a sentence. I am afraid to buy the full version because it may not be much better. It is clumsy and not laid out very well. Don't wait your time.
__label__0 I still have not been able to figure out how to use it.  Not at all user friendly.  Poor insturctions.
__label__1 When I searched for "soup" in Amazon apps, there were over 80 results. I decided to try the "iCooking Soups" app, which turned out to be a good choice. The app has fifty recipes for five different types of soup: cold, chunky, creamy, fish, and meat soups
__label__1 Great recipes included in the program. I also love the option of including my own recipes, so I can have all my soup recipes in the same place.
__label__1 It&apos;s good for using the creative and problem solving part of my brain and yet it is so relaxing that I play it at night when winding down for the day.  \n\nBeware their update asks for Fine Location which I do not do for apps that don&apos;t need to
__label__1 Great app love the twists to this and its a little addictive.  Nice to have if your somewhere that doesn't get wi fi
__label__1 quite possibly my favorite game ever.. it's challenging yet relaxing.  could spend hours playing if i didnt have a life/family.... great game!!!!!
__label__1 i have the paid version of the app. Works very well. The battery life on my Motorola Triumph went from 7 hours to 10 hours with moderate use.
__label__0 Does not work on Sprint Evo. Usually my phone will have power until anywhere between 5pm - 8pm. I installed this crap app, and by only 2 pm my phone battery was flashing red and about to power off. But it doesn't end there. I missed ALL calls for the day
__label__1 I heard about JuiceDefender from a friend and boy it makes a big difference on the battery life on my Droid.  I am so glad I took their advice to try it.
__label__1 One of the best things I have tried for my HP TP. Battery life is so much improved. Try it, no really..try it
__label__1 My phone used to go dead before the end of the day, JuiceDefender changed all of that. At the end of the day I still have 80% of my battery.
__label__1 absolutely does what it says. I took it off after months if use to see uf it really made a difference. went from 1.5 days back to less than a half day. couldn't wait for the battery to recharge so I could re download.
__label__1 I really don't concern myself with how juicedefender works. Just set the default and you will get considerably better battery life. I have used it on two Motorolas and a Samsung with great results. A must have.
__label__1 A huge problem with smartphones is always the battery life. Now, I'm able to save some more battery when the phone is not active.The balanced option is more than enough. I haven't tried the aggressive mode, as I have not needed to yet.My estimation is th
__label__0 It needs to run in the background and the app itself drains ur phone...total waste. I wish I would have known before.
__label__1 don't believe the idiots that rate this less than 4 stars cause they have no idea how to tie their shoe let alone run an app this pimp!  been using it (paid) for almost a 1 1/2 yrs through several devices and not once did it not perform.  If you want bet
__label__1 Most people will be happy with the free version, but some will appreciate the control afforded by the upgraded versions. Upgrading process went very smoothly for me... no uninstall was necessary, and all settings were kept.Had a 1.5x increase in battery 
__label__1 This is a great app! It keeps me honest with my battery power usage... I can now go much longer without recharging, with the same battery.
__label__1 I am a power user.  I use the phone for work and have an extended battery.  I normally end the day at 15% or so.  This app works.
__label__1 I have been using this app for close to 2 years. Those of you who say it does not work, please make sure your settings are set correctly. I get nearly 20 hours of battery life now on my sprint htc evo. Without it, I get nearly 12. The biggest benefit of 
__label__1 I was surprised to see that it really does save battery!  I was changing batteries several times daily (I have four of them) for my high use on the LG Connect 4G for metro.  Now change battery 1 time per day.  I rarely buy apps but I am seriously thinkin
__label__1 I used my EVO 3D for the first two Weeks I had it, and it is a power sucking beast. With juice defender, problem solved!
__label__0 It was a must have on my OLD phones but with the new phones you don't need it as they do it all for you. At least my Note II does.
__label__1 My Galaxy Tab 2  10.1 tablet accepts and uses JuiceDefender.Thie APP is unobtrusive and really does work.When the tablet is in sleep mode it is connected to the internet.That is just one of the battery drains it regulates.My time between recharges has de
__label__0 This app will NOT install on my Coby Kyros 7022.  I can't review an app I can't install. Let me know when I can.
__label__1 This is a great smart phone app. These new smart phone take a lot of batty energy. Many phones need to be charged during the day and can not go all day if you use your phone much. This program is great and monitors your energy use and makes recommendatio
__label__1 my battery stays for twice as long now idk how it works (kinda) but just set it and for get it. would be nice if I could exclude some things though..
__label__1 I'm not much of a "power user," but even on standby the battery life on the LG Optimus V was modest-at-best and sometimes ran low quicker than I would expect.  JuiceDefender, at its "balanced" setting helps extend the battery life fairly well, without li
__label__1 I highly recommend this app to maximize your smartphone's battery life. I am curious as to why the Amazon App Store has V. 3.8.3, but the Android Market has V. 3.8.4.
__label__0 I downloaded this app &amp; used it on my galaxy tab for about a month and I saw no benefit.  This app does not work as advertised and I do not recommend it.  If I paid for it, I  would want money back!!!!
__label__1 I have used Juice defender since my first smart phone.All my family uses it!Save me a lot of time recharging the phone.
__label__0 didnt like this . it sames to shout down all my stuff on my phone . if that is what you want then get it . i was trying to get a device that would keep me from going on my network internet because i couldnt find it on my phone . fixed that problem by doi
__label__1 as we know, the EVO has terrible battery life. with the aggressive function you can slow battery drain by over 50%!!! the app is brilliant
__label__1 has doubled my battery life on the aggressive setting. love it and highly recommended! gwt it while its frwah. joy joy
__label__1 I have tried using it in all 3 modes. The default mode was too simple for me, I like playing with my apps. The advanced mode was fun, butI ended up with limited savings of battery power.So now I use the mid mode. It lets me define some of the parameters 
__label__1 if your a zombie fan like me you'll dig it..it does get to hard fast but it makes you sweat to beat a lvl ..ignore the 1star trolls..they 1star everything  if skyrim was 60 fps for 1.99$ on here they'd find a reason to 1 star it...
__label__1 This game gives a different twist to tower defense. It is fun, engaging and creative. I love the fun nods towards cult classic and current zombie movies. They are subtle in some references and not so in others. Either way, this is a fun and awesome game!
__label__1 awesome game. the charactors are cool and the gameplay is sweet. you just arm your hunters, place them, and sit back and watch the destroy zombie hordes! you have a wide range if weapons (from 22. pistols to ak47s) its perfect to waste time in a fun way
__label__0 As the tigltle said it wouldn't work when I tried to open it and it kept flashing on the loading screen
__label__1 I downloaded this game awhile ago, and I didn't leave a review for it.  It don't work now for some reason but it was still a really great game, one of the best stratigraphic games on the market place.  Good job man.
__label__0 This is the worst product I have ever used I put it on my wife's phone, my daughter's phone, and my phone. Guess what they all stopped working. Biggest peice of crap I have ever used free apps are way better than this junk!! They must have paid the revie
__label__1 if its nots downloading the its not the app, but your dam phone troll. this app is a well earned 5. my battery life trippled thanks to this. dont listen to the 1 star troll review
__label__1 Android phones eat up battery life fast.  This product, with a minimum of fuss, will extend your battery life typically 1.5 - 2.25 times the pre-application life of the battery.  Yes, I wish it was a higher multiplier say like 7 or 8, but twice the batte
__label__1 JuiceDefender has cut my battery use by leaps and bounds.  It has only been installed for 24 hours now and I am getting at least 80% LESS drain.  Thanks for the app!
__label__1 I was skeptical about this app's performance but, it has turned out to be great. once I got it set up the way I wanted it has more than doubled my phone's battery life. I used to need a charge every day but, not anymore.
__label__0 I downloaded this on a free app of the day event. I gave it a shot. It didn't seem to save my battery and it caused problems with apps I did like so after a week of being annoyed I uninstalled it. I have an EVO 4G running Android 2.3.3.
__label__1 My Droid X is great, but getting though the day without charging was nearly impossible. With JuiceDefender Plus I can easily get through the day.  And by using JuicePlotter as well I can get a good estimate on how much time I have left on the current cha
__label__1 A great app, no doubt.But I wonder why Amazon sells an older version of this app. It has been upgraded more then once since this version. Weird...And then, this older version costs here more then the newer one in the Market. Weird too, no doubt.As for JD
__label__1 This translator works very well, and is easy to learn and use.  The voice pronunciations are easy to understand.  It will be a big help when going to Italy this summer!
__label__1 This app is magnifico! It is reaaly good, with word of the day! Download it, you won't be disappointed, I wasn't!
__label__0 This app is like google translate.... most of the translation are wrong. Dont get it cause they are all wrong
__label__0 the jokes aren't even funny when I saw it I looked at them and just quit no wonder its free
__label__0 if you buy this app all it does is take up space. the jokes are terrible and don't make any sense at all.
__label__0 this game ducks it has no good jokes on it.  I don't know why I got it . if the names said best jokes the jokes are no good.
__label__1 people that say these jokes suck. apperently don't REWD them or r to young to understand them. some of them are pretty funny
__label__1 I love this book because it have a lot of jokes and they are funny. I can tell them to my family
__label__1 This app is wonderful on so many different levels. It teaches animal names, the sounds they make, what kind of food they eat, how to properly pet an animal and what they look like from birth to adulthood. After you properly pet the pet it changes into a 
__label__1 we do this a lot, I love the imagination it brings to my son, thank you for a great product.
__label__1 I like this game very much! it is weird though when you see the turkey.......... its a nice game though!
__label__1 I give this app 5 stars because it's great for small kids and user friendly. It allows you to lock your Kindle to this app only, to keep your kids from going to other sites. Great learning tool. Your kids will love it if they like to learn.
__label__1 Colin and I played with this for 1/2 hour or more.  Lots of fun for a 2 1/2 yr old with his Grandmom.
__label__1 I really LOVED this app. Very fun and interactive. I am thinking about getting the full version, because it is so brilliant.
__label__0 This app was unable to sign me into any of my accounts. I'm very glad I had not paid for it.
__label__1 Works very well on my phone. And this app is great. Better than other chat apps worths all money.. .
__label__0 low score because of the client going through a server to log you in and transmit the messages.....thats stupid...why would you do that?? thats more frustrating than a 3 legged dog trying to bury a terd on an icy lake. it just dont make no sense...i woul
__label__1 great app. I can use this app for all my instant message clients such as google talk,yahoo,AOL and more. Easy to use.
__label__1 Overview: This app is awesome if you have multiple chat services, like many people, and always want to stay connected. Some of the most popular IMs are available which makes this app very versatile. For instance, I am able to see my chat buddies for Yaho
__label__0 I have had this app for awhile now and I have to uninstall it.  It does not work on the Xoom at all.  It auto starts all the time even after I turn it off.  I have asked the developer for help with no responds.  I am going to have to go with ebuddy.
__label__0 This app allowed my now ex-girlfriend to break up with me via 3G. If it weren't for this application,  I would still be dating her.One star since it combines all my IMs, though.
__label__0 Sluggish and unimpressive.Not as good as Trillian. Especially once you factor in the seamless desktop/Android/IOS/Web integration, there is no contest.IM apps like this have a long way to go to compete, esp. at this price point.
__label__1 I've been using this app for a month &amp; a 1/2 and its great. With the update its even better. I love the &quot;toast-like&quot; popup that appears when someone im's you where ever you are.Thank you for the great update !!
__label__1 It uses googles push to send and receive messages. This means that even if you lose connection you still get them as soon as you get your connection back. Awesome.
__label__0 There's a reason no other IM app asks for this permission. Send this developer a message. We won't put up with shoddy programming or spyware.
__label__1 I have been using this app forever as a Blackberry user and now with Android, allows me to stay connected work, family, and friends on multiple platforms at one time.
__label__1 I saw many reviews complaining about security risks with this app but I chose to ignore them, huge mistake. within 10 minutes of using this app someone had stolen my passwords. first was the password to my suitcase and luggage.  by the time I realized it
__label__1 I love this app because of its clean UI and its ease of use. Does exactly what I want without any hassle.
__label__0 I found it too much of a coincidence that my email account realeased a boatload of spam within minutes of downloading and setting up my email account on this app. Deleting immediately!!!!
__label__0 Of all the security risks I read from peoples reviews I am so not downloading this BS thank you so much every body who warn about this security risk n more I cant belive amazon offered up this
__label__0 This is a terrible app if you want to be able to use your phone for a few hours w/o charging. It also randomly disconnects you from one or more messengers. Do NOT download!
__label__0 After I installed the latest update, it immediately began using a huge amount of power.  The program's &quot;force stop&quot; option under Settings &gt; Applications &gt; Battery Usage was grayed out, so I had to uninstall the program.
__label__0 so I am forever getting text message spam since it keeps me logged in forever. I've tried logging off numerous times but they still come through. I'm pissed off since its wasting my text messages with spam text from idiots.
__label__0 It won't let me log on to my contacts.. I think it is a waste of space on my tablets memory...  do not recommend it..
__label__1 You have to buy the pro in order to have Skype. Skype for sure works well on the pro though.
__label__0 WARNING.  This application is a Security Risk!  IM+  servers read your password and then log into your account for you.  This means that your PASSWORD is sent over an INSECURE NETWORK....UNINSTALL IMMEDIATELY....
__label__0 Really? You are willing to give a third party all your IM logins and passwords and then also send all your messages through that party too?  This app is HUGE security risk.  THINK before you just blihdly trust apps...
__label__1 I've been through many IM client apps on my Android. Some are clunky, not intuitive, intrusive, difficult to use quickly and just plain crud.IM+ is simply the opposite of those. It's the easiest, cleanest looking IM app I have used to date. Before, I was
__label__0 Why does such an expensive app need so many invasive and risky permissions? is it poorly written code or does the dev just want to spy on us?I guess I will go back to eBuddy...
__label__1 I've been using the free (ad-encumbered) version for a while, and it's one of the best instant-messaging applications around. What a nice surprise to find it as the free app of the day.
__label__0 all connections go through their server (which means they can read all your messages and even send messages from you), and the app contains spyware.
__label__1 Rate the app, not Amazon! The app works great and really helps bring it all together with messaging. if you message allot you will like this app.
__label__1 I like this app. I'm on a G2. It's becoming more and more apparent that the best place to actually get reviews on an app is in the Market. It seems like Amazon's ratings are consistently lower than the ones in the Market for no good reason.This app is cl
__label__1 #1 it's free but even then this app is a great instant messaging applications that supports multiple instant messaging protocols and supports Google Push services.
__label__1 While I dont use all of the functions, I find the ones that I do use to be quite stellar. A worthy chat/social media compilation.
__label__1 As someone who has been downloading tablature since before there were web browsers, I can tell you this is the real deal. All the tab we've grown to know and love, just like it is on all the websites, but formatted to look good on a tiny screen (with som
__label__1 I've used the ultimate guitar website for years, and while the accuracy of user-submitted tabs is hit-and-miss, there are always plenty to choose from.  This app is easy to use, and within a minute of loading it I pulled up and tried out a bass line I ha
__label__0 Does not work anymore. Not sure what happened. Type in search field and it crashes. Pain in the buns. Paid for it and used all the time. Now it is useless. Expensive too.
__label__1 Love this. Replaced two apps on my phone, and a great assortment of tabs. You can auto-scroll a tab if you want, to make play-along easier.  Lots of different guitar tunings available. The price is a tad high, but still, I strongly recommend.
__label__1 Tremendously convenient and fun app for guitar players. I hope the developer makes some money with this one. QWERTY, QWERTY.
__label__1 All of the features work well on my Droid Incredible 2. Didn't find tabs for some songs I searched, but most of them were there.Ya'all shouldn't rate an app poorly because Amazon doesn't behave the way you expect. Complain to Amazon if the free app isn't
__label__1 I cannot believe i got this for free. This app organizes the websites content very well. I actually prefer this app to the website. To the reviewer who said he wouldn't trust the tabs: these tabs are submitted by all sorts of musicians. If you want exact
__label__1 Like the app better than using the full web site. Great job! Love the transpose feature. The tools section is also very handy.
__label__0 I was really looking forward to downloading and using this app.  But, there is a problem with installing it just hangs on my samsung fascinate galaxy s phone. However, It allowed me to download it so maybe they will make a patch so I may use it then I ca
__label__0 It seems to me the developer has abandoned the development of this app, or care less about compatibility with tablets.
__label__1 shows tabs and automatically transposes. Tons of artists and song titles. Powerful tools. Wish it showed 7th w/ flatted 5th chords. Well worth the 7.99.
__label__1 I love this app!  Most of the songs I have checked out have not only guitar tabs but also just lyrics and chords which is perfect for me as a pianist.  Awesome app!  Thanks!
__label__1 Finally an app that has it all, whether you're an amateur or a professional guitarist. It loads smoothly, and the graphics are great. Wonderful for on the fly jam session,  finding the tabs to a song couldn't get any easier. A++++  HTC Incredible.*note* 
__label__0 This app used to be the best, and probably still is in the Google Play Store. Too bad the developer has apparently forgotten about the Amazon Marketplace. Does not work on ICS or Jelly Bean devices, it crashes every time you type in the search box.
__label__1 tuner is ok. I love that I can just look up what I want to play right on my phone. pretty handy app for a beginner.
__label__1 I have literally no problems with this app, it's wonderful. Every song I look up has an accurate tab and it's helping me practice so efficiently. I'm getting better at playing by ear as a result. This app has been integral to my learning guitar and I rec
__label__0 does not work on tablets, or android 4.1, nexus 7please update this soon! I depend on this app to play my music on guitar! let us know when an update is coming.
__label__1 This app is even easier to use than the online version for UG! Best way by far to get tabs.
__label__1 this app looks great on my Aria running CM7. I dont know why other people are having issues. love the app as I am learning the guitar.
__label__1 Bad reviewers have ruined this appstore. As a developer I won't publish anything to the appstore because of the awful reviews everything gets. You all ruined it. A free app everyday but all you people do is whine. An 1 star app here is a 5 star app on th
__label__1 This utility does exactly what it says it does. This is not Guitar Hero, but a functioning musical utility.  Read the description...what you'll read is exactly what you'll get.Well done, developers.  And thank you Amazon.
__label__1 This app is great! It has really neat built in features that can search for tabs of the song that is playing on your music player. Also, the tuner and the metronome are pretty good as well. Well made app, runs smoothly on droid x
__label__1 Metronome tool makes it easy to discover the beat of your favorite song.  it is easily adjustable and a keeper for sure
__label__1 I was just thinking the night before, "I wonder if there's a good app to get on my phone to help me learn how to play the guitar?" And boom! Amazon App of the Day gives me Ultimate Guitar Tabs and Tools!Not only does it show all their user submitted guit
__label__1 Truly an awesome, ultimate program for any level of skill. You get 5* and a thank you! Pls add the 11 and 13 chords, and their #'s and b's.  This really is a great learning/teaching tool. Thanks again for sharing it for Free, I for one will recommend it,
__label__1 This tuning feature is worth its weight in gold alone. But the ability to easily find thousands of songs makes this priceless. It also has a metronome and comes in handy when you need to look up a specific cord.If you play guitar, get this app without he
__label__1 awesome look and works great! I'm going to pick up my guitar and start playing again!!!!! thanks dev!! totally worth 8 bucks!!!!!
__label__1 Played with it for a while just to get a feel and i really like what I am seeing. It makes me wish i had a tablet since a pgone is just to small to really read.But, when I'm sitting around the fire and a friend wants to jam a song I dont know? Well, I wi
__label__1 I've found pretty much everything I looked for.  Usually, there are several options, all rated.  Not sure where the tabs come from, but it is a nice interface as well.  You can tap the chords to see them tabbed, and even convert the music to a different 
__label__1 It's the iMusicstand!  I have been using this on every rare chance I have to sit down and play.  Great app, and user friendly.  Worth the price in my opinion.
__label__1 I haven't had a single force close issue like others have reported. it works flawlessly on my droid x.finding tabs, cords etc is now super easy!  this is a must for anyone that plays guitar!
__label__1 As a beginning guitar player, I have searched for websites that offer guitar tabs for all of my favorite songs. I finally settled on Ultimate Guitar as my favorite. They had a seemingly endless supply of great tabs for all skill levels. I stumbled across
__label__1 This works just as well as the website does for tabs, it's nice to be able to open this up and riff out to a tab I just thought of rather than walking over to my computer. Now if I could find a tuner app for my phone that is good!
__label__1 What an awesome free app of the day! The tools included would make it worth at least $5 all by themselves, but the library of chords and tablature make this app an utter steal at $8. The auto-scroll feature is great too.If you play guitar or bass, or are
__label__0 Another waste of time. Why does this app have to be in my phone's main storage? If I cannot transfer it to the SD card, it gets one star right after I delete it.
__label__1 Years ago I had a book that featured all the different chord positions for a particular chord along the fretboard.  I lost that book and have never been able to find another one like it.  This fantastic app not only offers this feature, but also gives yo
__label__1 This app is an excellent collection of tools for guitarists. Of course the tabs themselves are stored online - You don't have enough room on your phone for it all - but this makes the database super-accessible. In addition, there are quite a few great to
__label__1 This app is really easy to use.  Fluid navigation, and the tuner makes it worth the money alone. Very visual, fluid graphic movement, sensitive enough, easy to use on stage on the road. Love the tap feature on the metronome.
__label__1 As a casual guitarist this is simply an invaluable tool to have in the box.  The database of tabs is impressive.  The ability to click on any chord during a song and reveal tab/finger placement is very helpful.  You can also play the song while viewing t
__label__0 App crashes as soon as I type the first letter into the search box. So basically, this is useless... Used to work great, please fix!!
__label__1 &quot;This game sucks. I much prefer guitar hero.&quot; Is that a joke? Seriously. Because, if it is, at least give 5 stars. If it's not... good luck with life kid. You're gonna need it.
__label__1 Don't rate this poorly because it doesn't work with a custom ROM, blame  the ROM creator. How many custom ROMs are out there anyway? Get real.Don't rate things poorly because it's not for you. You never would have purchased this and subjected the dev to 
__label__1 This app is amazing for when it comes to learning how to play guitar. I can check out my favorite songs and learn how to play them as well as beginner chords.
__label__0 I rated three stars but my review was deleted so now you get ONE star! How do you like them apples?
__label__1 The many features make this app worth the price. The  metronome is a great resource, it has helped improve my timing.  I use this frequently and have no trouble. The advanced search option makes it easy to find a specific guitar tab for your tuning and s
__label__0 As stated by others, needs ICS support. Force closes when attempting to sync with account, meaning favorites list cannot be added to or accessed.
__label__1 Got to admit this is one awesome app. One of the better free app of the day. Wish they gave more awesome apps! This one by far odd the best since sound hound.
__label__0 These guys don't play guitar, this app is junk. Check out guitar tapp app. One is free. Two has all these songs with a link to YouTube for video lessons. Three much easier to use. Four you can make sets for playing out. Please save your money and go chec
__label__1 I am learning the guitar and this is an indespensible tool. The are tons of chords to learn and they are here. This is one of the best free apps ever!  Get it NOW!!!
__label__0 Will not install samsung galaxy s epic so its hard to do a review when it won't even install. At least do the free purchase for this expensive app
__label__1 WOW is my rating. ignore the one star ratings. This app does it all with a very well done interface!My one complaint is that it doesn't wrap the text of the tab makers explanation  of their tab but I can live with  that.Has a very nice looking high res i
__label__1 Wow, seriously?!? I just had to scroll down to see that write up myself, hahaha.First, read app descriptions. Second, download if you're serious about trying a guitar tabs app on your phone because you want to improve, change things up from how you check
__label__1 It's been awhile but with the plethora of apps available for ios and now that Android is getting some, I just may go to the pawn shop and pick up a guitar. I'm self taught so this app is perfect as I can't read music so well, but with a resource like thi
__label__1 Contains everything you need to tune your guitar and learn some new songs.  A great application.  Nice that each tablature gets a rating so you can jump to the best version easily.
__label__0 Crahes on Nexus 10 when entering search...please fix. App does not work, not acceptable. I think app in google play has been fixed a long time ago
__label__1 I got this from the FAotD. I can say I've never seen such an amazing app come through Amazon for free. This is a very well designed app. Looks and works great. Droid X.
__label__1 This may be the greatest review ever.Still, I feel bad. After the disappointment of all the pieces looking alike with the free 'chess' game a few weeks back, now this...
__label__1 Search by different criteria, large database, has song chords as well, can transpose dater than I... I can't say anything bad about this.
__label__0 Doesn't work on Galaxy Nexus / Ice Cream Sandwich.  :-(I'd give it a great rating if it worked.  What a shame.
__label__1 I had the version of this without the tools and I'm very happy to have gotten this on the FAOTD. As a decent guitar player it is nice to easily navigate their tab selection and have the tools such as different chord positions and things like that. I high
__label__1 This game sucks. I much prefer Guitar Hero. I could not get the songs to play or figure out how to play along on my phone. Guitar Hero is much easier to use in my opinion. Open to suggestions though.
__label__1 This is the best free app of the day I've seen in some time. However, of the multitude of free app I have received, this is the first one that asked me for payment information. Is this really free? I don't want to give payment information.
__label__1 I really find this to be usefull! And it's free...Thanks Amazon. Works great on my Samsung Galaxy 10.1! I love the library of songs too.
__label__1 All the tabs work great. Searches came back with what I was looking for too. Nice metronome. Tuning good. No force closures. I'm ready to work on my skills.Thank you.
__label__1 Way to go Amazon! You've restored my faith in you. This app is great. Was actually thinking of buying this just the other day. It's like you read my mind.
__label__0 this would not download on my machine.  I tried.  I would love to be able to play this game.  Millie
__label__0 This game bored me pretty quickly.  I deleted within 30 minutes.  Not recommended for someone who likes words games that move along quickly.
__label__1 I am addicted to this game.  I really like word games and tried this as an experiment.  Now I can't put it down.  It's challenging, it works your mind and just maybe it will keep me from getting senile.
__label__1 To all the negative reviews; there's a bigger picture to solving these puzzles effectively! Sure, some of the words are so outrageous that you wouldn't even see them on a Scrabble board but this puzzle 2 dimensions to solving. First of all, it keeps thin
__label__1 good apps for all ages.It works even no internet connection. Great because you will get many idea about countries.
__label__1 Hey, I am actually learning things! I like this quite a bit, since as we age we sometimes forget things we learned in school.  Also, this world is constantly changing, so it's good to keep up!
__label__1 Lots of practical information that has allready improved my use of the Kindle.
__label__1 I travel a lot. Just needed a good general reference. This suits me just fine. Gives me the big picture at a glance
__label__1 I haven't found any other games like this that are as good, and I've been searching high and low! Good story, easy controls, lots of levels. I wish I could find something else on Amazon our Android that are comparable!!
__label__1 Love the Delicious game series &amp; this translated well from pc to mobile app! Runs well - Droid X. Easy to maneuver, great time management game! Some graphics are a little odd (speech bubbles) but it is worth it for $2.99 and snap it up for free with 
__label__0 it could be better but thats just opionion also u should get it b/c everyone has there own taste nd opinion
__label__1 I got this as a free download, but is worth the cost. Cute, fun, and can be challenging on the hard level.  I recommend it
__label__0 Tried this game free on Amazon, and it force closed after day 8. Glad I didn't buy it first! I have an HTC Inspire.
__label__1 This is a fantastic game. Intuitive, challenging, addictive, and cute.  My only requests would be: improved shop interface, ability to go to waypoints not just destinations, and a way to avoid accidentally clicking the wrong thing (I would love to play t
__label__1 Although I have yet to play it, a few kids have and declared it fit for playing.  The graphics seem ok - but the story seems to really reel them in.  No complaints - I will have to try it sooner or later.
__label__1 delicious Emily is the best game on my kindle, it is super fun and also has no glitches! I totally reccomend this game
__label__1 Such a fun game, flawless beautiful artwork, kudos to the designers. Such fun, too. The storyline was cute. This is why people buy smartphones.
__label__0 Constant lockups and such caused me to drop this after short use attempts for a week or so. I do not hate the program, just found it quirky and unuseable.
__label__1 Love this game. It reminds me of Diner Dash with a little plot and variety. I got it when it was the free game of the day, but worth paying for. I finished the game and went back to get other stuff I missed the first time around and I didn&apos;t have an
__label__1 Love the Emily games!  If you play this one on a phone with a bigger screen, it won't fill the screen
__label__1 I installed this game during its one-day run as the free-app-of-the-day.  I didn't actually expect to get much from it other than a possible game to add to the distractions for my kid.  It was sort of hard to anticipate what to make of it from the screen
__label__1 Love this game! Lots of fun and never gets monotonous. Did run into a small issue when I finished the last level-the last day kept replaying. that was on medium. Now I&apos;m going to try hard. Love that there is a difficulty setting too!
__label__1 I was so sad that the game ended. it kept me occupied and curious from beginning to end. I wish there were more games like this one. too cute!!!
__label__1 This game is entertaining and easy to get the hang of.  It is mostly fast-paced with a little bit of strategy.  After playing through a few levels I felt like the frantic pace sharpened my alertness for whatever I was doing next in real life.  You will p
__label__1 I love this game. Beautiful graphics, plays beautifully on Sprint Samsung Epic. No glitches what's ever. Wish all games tan this smoothly.
__label__1 I love the cafe game on facebook and this reminds me of it.. I haven't had any problems on my Thunderbolt
__label__0 I initially entered my device to look for games and this came up and I purchased.  But when I tried to download it says that it is not compatible.  I wasted my money!!  I am rating my purchase experience, because I was unable to play the game. Thanks a l
__label__0 the screen flickers between the game and another screen that shows green  dots  with  a black  background two  times  a second. annoying and absolutely  unplayable.
__label__1 This has been a very entertaining game for me.  I usually have to play each level at least twice.  The first time to see how the new items work so that i can plan my time to get the best score.  I sometimes miss the mouse and have to play again to catch 
__label__1 Totally addicting. Hope there is a sequel :) Easy, repetitive. I like those kinds of games sometimes. Cute storyline too. No bugs that I noticed, I always appreciate that.
__label__1 I think three bucks might be on the pricier side of a game like this, but I did find myself entertained and wanting to play more the more I messed around on this game. I like the achievements and how you can purchase upgrade to make your customers happy 
__label__0 Do you like chick flicks and shopping for shoes? Well then, this game may be for you!  Do you hate one star reviews and cal everyone with opinions that differ from yours an idiot?  Well maybe you live in a communist state where you arent allowed to have 
__label__1 Easy to pick up and play.  Fairly simple to master.  My only criticism is that I wish there were more levels.
__label__1 grest game well worth $2.99 just which it wad longer and wish more Emily games where available for the fire.
__label__1 The plot in this game is laidback and interesting.  Especially for a time management game.  Not too easy and not too stressful, I found this game a delight to play.  At times I didn't want to put it down.  It ran perfectly on my HTC Incredible.
__label__1 Good, addicting game. It's a little cheesy, but is a good way to waste time. Has quite a few levels that build on each other, so it takes a while to beat. No problems on HTC Inspire 4G
__label__1 I can play this for a long time in one sitting. Its always fun, clean and polished. Runs smooth, and changes it up from your regular  diner games. Definitely recommend this game.
__label__1 High quality, addicting game that plays very much like Flo's Diner. The game adds more depth to the gameplay through specific order items, with some that need to be crafted. You need to be quick to handle orders from customers that dine in, get it to-go,
__label__0 I'm so disappointed.  The game is way too small to play on my kindle.  I want my 199 coins refunded to me!
__label__1 totally fun, good for some mindless entertainment. got through it all within 10 days.  wasn't so difficult that I wanted to give up, but wasn't so easy that I got bored.
__label__1 This is a fun time management game, but I wish there were more levels. The achievements were fun to strive for.
__label__1 I'm a guy who would not typically be attracted to the visuals in this sort of game.  Once I got started, however, the game became very addictive and I found a very therapeutic and exciting.  I really appreciate the different levels and scenarios added to
__label__1 ive never played diner dash...but ive seen pictures and this looked similar. i dont know if it is....but its really fun and pretty long for a cheap game. it has awards and good replay value. great game overall.
__label__1 A little disclaimer before I start:For all you whack jobs who will claim me to be, I am not, nor have I ever been the developer of this or any game/app/etc. Just because you don't like or haven't tried this game, that doesn't mean nobody else can like it
__label__0 There are a, couple of problems with this game one is that the hit boxes for the game are not very accurate. I also had the same problem with the game freezing at level 8 so I would pass on this game. Does not work on evo 3d
__label__1 Review and Rating Update 05/14/14: Dev has now updated graphics so can now be played on HD tablets! It still works fine on smaller screen smartphones too.-----I wish I had read the reviews first, but it's true - it's a tiny display on the bottom left cor
__label__1 I've loved the Delicious series on the PC platform for years and I was so excited to see it available on Android. The gameplay transfers really well to the touch screen platform.
__label__1 Simple to learn game and challenging in a good way. Was great for commuting on train.\nWish there were more levels.\n
__label__1 This was a great game, but it was too short for me. Or I was just too addicted to put it down for long.
__label__1 it's the best game I ever played it keeps me going on wanting to play. some of the game.we to me are to expensive but I would buy them cause it a great game.
__label__1 I couldn't stop playing.  Lots of levels and challenges.  Very creative.  I enjoyed the little stories mixed in with the game.  Thank you
__label__1 fun game. worth it for free. would rate 4 stars but giving 5 to try and help balance the stupid people who shouldn't be allowed to rate apps.
__label__1 The game is cute reminds me of diner dash but more colorful.  Sad what happens to Francois though...  Lol overall fun game.
__label__1 I thought this was a fun game. I couldn't put it down. This is one of the few games I finished. I hope they come out with more levels.
__label__1 I wasn't expecting much when I read the description, but I'm glad I was wrong! This game turned out to be pretty fun! The story was decent, the controls good, and it keeps you hooked with minor differences as you progress through the levels.
__label__0 Dumb game. This game is more like giving yourself chores. Pass on this game. If you want extra chores I can give you some of mine.
__label__1 This game is addictive... So much fun! Well designed application. The user interface is easy to use. Straight forward game play.
__label__1 I wasn't sure how I was going to feel about this game...  I love it...  I beat it quick and hope more of these come to android.
__label__1 I got this while it was free. I really enjoyed the game. One of the few on my phone that I've completed plus I'm considering going back to work on the levels I didn't get max score.
__label__1 Being a fan of the game since the first Delicious, this one has always been my favorite of all six of them. Since it is free for the time being, go grab it while it's still hot. :)
__label__1 Ok, at first I'm thinking, ok, another cookbook app (maybe like iCookbook?) as I have never heard of this series of game (yet it appears to be extremely popular to those in the know)but boy, was I wrong.Disclaimer: I got this as Amazon's free app of the 
__label__1 I downloaded this for my Epic 4G.  I played through the first 2 levels and so far it is a lot of fun.  I've always been a fan of high score games so this seems like a good one because there is always an opportunity to faster to get higher tips.  Anyway, 
__label__1 I loved this game.  Challenging and addictive game that I would recommend to anyone.  Hope that there will be more games like this one.  Thank you.
__label__0 I'm a big fan of the delicious emily games so when I saw this on the amazon market I was thrilled. I would happily pay 1.99 for this game.  Problem is, on the kindle fire hd, the restaurant only takes up the bottom left of the screen.  The rest of the sc
__label__1 This game has pretty good graphics, several levels and lots of different tasks to accomplish. After getting through the whole game, it was fun to go back and try to get higher scores and collect all the "fireworks". Similar to Diner Dash or Cake Mania bu
__label__0 I was gonna try this cuz it's free but why would it need access to phone calls? Does not make sense to me.
__label__1 Great fast-paced game with a cute little story. Enjoyed the variety each restaurant had. Also includes unlockables, trophies and a few hidden objects.
__label__1 This game is better than your average time management game. There are several different themes for each main level such as a diner, farm, candy shop and more. Each of the main levels has different foods and methods of preparing the items. Each sub-level 
__label__1 I have played both Emily games and love them. They are a lot like dash games. The scenarios keep changing, the story lines are cute, and best of all, no in app purchases. I wish there were more.
__label__1 Great app, uses your GPS to track you and hosts it on their website. Then you can send the link to friends or share the link on fb/twitter/email and they can track you. Very accurate and detailed tracking, accurate within a foot and detailed in that it s
__label__1 Used this on our vacation while traveling with family.  It worked great!  Comforting to be able to track and know where the others are at all times.  No getting lost with this type of communication
__label__0 I uninstalled it a few minutes after trying it.  I'm sure it will be useful for someone else but not me. Sorry.
__label__0 Have this app on iphone and use it almost daily.  Love it.  Desolated it fails to load on my 8.9.  Please fix fail-to-load problem.  One star only because it fails to load - it really is a five-star app.Thank you.
__label__1 I follow my son's progress on his 3 1/2 hour trip to and from here. It is good to have.
__label__1 My wife and I used to always use Latitude to see where each other were.  Especially useful when we commute and we would like to know where the other is and how far away they are.  This has been the best option I have been able to find ever since Google c
__label__0 This calendar/memo app is a piece of junk...Not even worth it...After downloading I realized that this app doesn't keep my appointments, meetings, etc... organize well...Doesn't show current date either when not in full use of using this app...
__label__1 You should so get this calender. You can write your reminders, and even you can put little tiny colored  sticky pieces of paper on the side. And you can mark them off!!! I give this 5 stars!!!
__label__1 Really good and interesting app. When you click on the date you want, at the bottom it open kind of a notebook/reminder that let you read what's planned.
__label__0 Wasn't what I was looking for in a calendar. I didn't easily find my way around in this app. Deleted and just went with another app.
__label__1 finally just a basic calendar that doesn't require going 5 levels deep just to see a date or jot down your day.
__label__1 Good way to keep up with appointments, due dates and things of that nature.  I really enjoy having this on my Kindle Fire.
__label__0 I could never write on the days that I needed reminded of appointments.  I did not like it. I thought I would be able to write on the days in calendar.
__label__1 I tried other calendar apps and this one is the best for me. Hope you have good handwriting, but love the fact i can make my own note for the day and not a stale typed note!
__label__1 You can put notes on everyday, you can colorcode your appointments, meeting, school orany activities.  You can type an entire list and save it.Wonderful, could use more color tabs and a sectionto keep memos not attached to a date. But other thanthat it i
__label__1 I am so glad that I got this.  I was very pleased with it.  I use it for everything!  I wish all the apps like this were this awesome!  you'll be very happy with it.
__label__0 hard to believe a calendar can change its mind at a whim. this one does. sometimes the days/dates are accurate, sometimes they are not. i recently went to make an appointment, looked at my app and knew right away something was wrong as oct 25, 2012 is no
__label__1 Note pad is great to keep things listed that you must do. And just to jot down things at the spur of a moment.
__label__1 I absolutely love this calander I would totally recommend it to all my friends which I have. It is so easy to use!!!! Also another calendar app I love almost as much as this one is the Jorte calander. it has great features like a task list and color coat
__label__1 After searching all the calendar apps for my kindle, this was the only one that fit my needs. It has a color coding part too! I love this calendar app, and if you are looking for the best, here it is. And the best part is..  IT'S FREE!!! Whoever heard of
__label__0 It's not what I was looking for. I want something easy. I don't have time for something so difficult and takes time to learn
__label__1 the font is just the right size!it is just what i was looking for.and it was free !
__label__1 Great calander easy to use.  I use it to keep up with doctor appt's, hair appt's, etc.  I find it to be perfect for me.
__label__1 I needed a simple calendar to help track reminders and this one does the trick. It is easy to use and works great.
__label__1 Love having the different ones so I can have all I need in one place and not have to run around with pen and paper.
__label__1 Haven't used it completely yet, have it on my KINDLE FIRE will see soon.  Like to be able to mail or send messages regarding events
__label__0 This would not work on my Kindle Fire HDX. I deleted it. Wish I could find one that works for me.
__label__0 I didn't really use it other than opening it up because of the ads, which I don't mind.  The problem was the ads are oriental NOT English.  Considering my native language is English and I am American I found this insulting so I uninstalled the app and fo
__label__1 I love this app just at first it was a little confusing. but you pick up what everything does after that. ITS GREAT
__label__1 When it comes to planning, I'm there. This app is perfect because you can add multiple memos to one day. I keep track of my work hours, family events, church events, everything, through this app. It is simple to use. There aren't a bunch of buttons to le
__label__1 I like the calendar as it shows me the whole calendar of each month and also let's me see just the dates I have applied a message calendar. Still learning, but it is easy for me to learn.
__label__1 Haven't used it much but seems great! Love my Kindle fire 1 thinking bout the HD But this works so well
__label__1 I use this with my Notebooks Pro they go hand and hand. as I sit in meetings I have this up to mark any other meeting I may have and also put in my Notebooks Pro.
__label__1 I love this notebook, I looked at many others and didn't like them as much.I just wanted a simple calendar. Not a work calendar.
__label__1 it's not hard to do and you can write alot for each day..enjoy being able to have different color tabs for doctors visits, B-DAY, special events..
__label__0 It was not like the description. It was not what I was looking for and was hard to use. I deleted it.
__label__1 Another app that is simple and just what you need, not a bunch of junk on there that you will never use. Thank you George;
__label__1 got this to use on my kindle and it does a fine job.  easy to read and see what is coming, can sync with calendars so dont miss things
__label__0 I was looking for a simple calendar to use on my Kindle Fire for everyday type of reminders.  I downloaded this program but could not install because I received a message that the file was corrupt.
__label__1 This is a good way to keep track of appointments and miscellaneous information right at your fingertips - recommend for anyone who has a busy schedule - or even not!!
__label__0 I have a heart condition and it is super important for me to keep notes of my blood pressure, weight, heart rate, and sodium intake for each day.  I WAS in love with this app until it deletes almost a month of my notes, and there is no way to get them ba
__label__0 I got this app because I needed a day planner. but I cant put reminders on other days. I can only put notes on today. DONT GET! REALLY NEEDS AN UPDATE!
__label__0 not for me it did not have the features hat I wanted, but maybe for some people it woul be great
__label__0 I could not get into this.  After set up. 'done', it would only tell me to go to cosi.com.  It goggles back and forth between that and a page for a family photo (which I don't have).  It's uninstalled.
__label__0 I downloaded this calendar to my Kindle Fire.  You can add notes and appointments to the calendar by touching the applicable date on the calendar.  To go to the next month, slide your finger across the screen.  However, there is no way to type the date a
__label__1 I have used a "paper" organizer for years and this one has done a great job of replacing my "paper one". Takes just a little bit of setup when you first start...but you quickly get a feel for what it can do.  I am using it combined with the EANovate app.
__label__1 I've uploaded a few calendar apps, this is the only keeper. It's basic and I- do not need to sync.  Only one day and I'm already happy.And it was free today so people should stop whining when it cost them nothing!!!!
__label__0 This app doesn't work. There is no way to type and add notes for a particular day. At least it's free.
__label__1 I love this app. I am in college and this helps me keep track what's due and what classes I have that day.
__label__1 I actually love this app! Don't waste your money on other apps when this one is perfectly fine you can check when everything is and even go ahead and back many many many years
__label__0 The app worked for a few weeks on my Kindle Fire but now while it's on the loading screen it just crashes (or as Kindle likes to put it just stops). It's kind of upsetting since it works on on my Galaxy 2 but not on my Fire.
__label__1 Tried other lyric apps, they were terrible, could never s find the song I was looking for. This app is great, fast, and right on the money! A++
__label__0 This app really frustrated me! I searched &quot;Payphone&quot; by Maroon 5 and you will never guess what the freaking app told me! It said no match found! so much for 4 stars! Throw that out the window! id give it 0 if I could!
__label__1 Runs on droid2 &amp; Xoom full screen w/ great graphics. I turned off d-pad and just used direct touch which worked better for me.
__label__0 This game was going pretty well. It was a cute puzzle with pigs. The controls respond a little slow, but other than that it was fun. THEN all of a sudden while playing I recieve a phone call and the game breaks.I tried to close the game but it won't work
__label__1 One of my very favorite phone games.  The puzzles are just difficult enough (so far)... colors are bright, love the &quot;story.&quot;  DROIDX w\/gingerbread.
__label__1 enjoyable way to spend some time, this is not dumbed down, instead you need to apply logic to come up with creative solutions. great way to destress and take a break.
__label__1 I was lucky enough to get this for free, but even if you weren't, you should definitely pick this up. Its probably the best puzzler I've played in a while. Runs great, looks great, and keeps you entertained!For more of my game/app reviews and the full re
__label__1 Very fun game that reminds me if spider pig spider pig nobody can do what spider pig does. It's an entertaining game that doesn't bore in the first 5 minutes. Recommend it.:)
__label__1 This is a very fun game. I uninstalled but only because I beat it, after MANY middle of the night baby feeding/game sessions.
__label__1 This app works fine on my Samsung Intercept (Virgin Mobile) which is kind of a low end phone. Its a pretty large distribution at 15MB but it mostly moves to SD  leaving just 900KB of internal memory.
__label__1 I'm giving this app 5 stars to offset the idiots only giving it 1 star! I would give it 4 stars. It's a fun time waster with decent graphics and very good play. Why do people come to amazon if they don't wanna sign up for an account?  I have over 30 apps
__label__1 well its good to know there's only a few people who rate this game with one star all these days I feel angry because the low reviews. come on people. It's free
__label__1 We are playing this on Kindle Fires.I have liked previous incarnations of this game on various platforms. My wife hates this type of game. Guess who's many levels ahead?If you haven't played this type of puzzle game before, give it a try. Not only is it 
__label__1 great, entertaining puzzle game.  so far im about half way through.  low points, sometimes the on screen dpad doesnt do exactly what youre directing it to do, and some of the 3D graphics are tricky to visualize during the course of the game.  otherwise, 
__label__0 this is the first game I wanted to finish perfectly on android. Great puzzles and unique abilities and I was hooked for over a week.
__label__1 I purchased this through Amazon a while ago (and here it is free.. ..ugh!). My only consolation is that HandyGames actually deserves my money on this one. Great game with great graphics. It's as charming as it is fun and it looks great on my Asus Transfo
__label__1 A cute, polished, well done puzzle game. Sticks to the theme very well. Worth the 99&cent; cost for sure; even better free :)
__label__1 I almost did not download this app when Amazon had it as the 'Free App of the Day' because of the negative reviews at the time. But I did anyway. I am VERY glad that I did, I have not seen any merit to the negative reviews.Pros: Good graphics, great game
__label__1 I love this game! It is fun and very well made. It runs smoothly on my EVO4G. Great gameplay, completely worth it!Great developers, great games, keep up the great work!
__label__1 It may look like a kids' game, but it's not.  Like all games, the early levels are simple.  The challenge and logic needed increases as the characters are added.  The game field becomes more complex and you have to use the right pig with their special ab
__label__1 This is a fun little brain game that makes you think to find the solutions to little puzzles you have to navigate.  Learning it is pretty easy as each pig is introduced to you one at a time so you can learn them before moving onto the next.  The levels s
__label__1 reminds me of 'Adventures of LoLo'.  Fun and different game. kinda funny too. graphics are good. runs ok on droid x
__label__1 This game has been fantastic! I downloaded it for me, but my kids love it too. They would play it for hours if I'd let them. The graphics are very nice and smooth, and the characters are cute. I would absolutely recommend this to just about anyone lookin
__label__1 this is a puzzle game with a cute theme. you use four pigs, each with their own simple abilities, to solve the puzzle. similar to games where you move the right rocks or flip the right switches to move to the next level. the game is fun and addicting. Am
__label__1 Amazon doesn't charge for the free apps. But they do require you to have an amazon account (also free). I've ordered several free apps of the day. I complete the transaction and get a receipt with a zero balance. Stop dissin' amazon!Game is fun and cute.
__label__1 I've noticed this game before on the Android Market and just looked past it, but after playing for a few minutes I was loving it!Awesome graphical style, a little kiddie, a little not.  The challenge is perfect for the type of game.  Its really easy to m
__label__1 downloaded and installed this on my nook color and it works great is fun and the graphics are amazing. the best part is that it is free!
__label__1 This is truly a good game. I've had the free version for quite some time, so I was extremely happy to get the paid version for free today!I'll admit, this is not the game I choose to play most of the time, but that's not cuz it isn't good...it just isn't
__label__0 HTC Desire running 2.2 Froyo. Application crashes after the developer screen time and again. Looked like a solid puzzle game. I'll have to live vicariously through others on this app.
__label__1 blah blah blah blah blah  great game , very fun, like it alot, blah blah blah blah blah blah blah  great game , very fun, like it alot, blah blah blah blah blah blah blah  great game , very fun, like it alot, blah blah
__label__1 I got this app as one of the free apps of the day.  It's a fun game that is pretty challenging.  It's definitely a great way to pass some time.
__label__1 I have spent many hours playing (replaying) Aporkalypse and enjoy it immensely.  Just noticed how many levels you actually get and its a decent amount considering if you play go enjoy, half 'n hour can be spent on one level just to get the maximum coins.
__label__1 Fun puzzle/maze game! Good graphics (Angry Birds style) and runs smoothly.  I'll probably be hooked on this one for the next week or so (depends on how long it takes to finish all the levels).  It was easy to learn (tutorial in game), and has a thorough 
__label__1 This game is a lot of fun. The graphics are great, gameplay is enjoyable, and it's cheap. Try this game you won't regret it. The characters are amusing.
__label__1 very fun game. reminds me of walkabout and bobby carrot. i like the pig characters and their different abilities. if you like puzzles this is for you.
__label__1 cute old style game easy to play.works well on htc thunderbolt.  not really my kind of game but worth the download.
__label__1 This game is a lot of fun. Great time killer that makes you use your brain. Cute storyline. Worth a dollar!
__label__1 if you can't download the app then how can you give it any review at all? you can't one star an app just because you are too scared to create an account. if you ever got anything from Amazon.com you probably have an account and guess what, they kept your
__label__1 Totally fun mindless game to kill the boredom as I wait for the bus after work. Doesn't even drain my phones battery that fast
__label__1 cool game. entertaining. not the most challenging, but it is fun to play. blah blah blah blah blah blah blah
__label__1 Ever since upgrading from Windows 3.1, I've hoped for an update of the classic puzzle game Chips Challenge. But until today, I had never found one.The story is like many others... Navigate a character(s) through puzzle levels with tricks, gadgets and ene
__label__1 hi again. im back. this is definately a keeper. go ahead and download this. works beautifully on samsung epic. easy control. addictive game. storyline game. to know what this game is..  imagine wii pacman with 8bit nintendo zelda and add goofy. all toget
__label__1 I don't play many video games, let alone one on my phone, but when I saw this as the free app of the day I downloaded it and have been playing it ever since.  Admittedly it can be frustrating at times, but the cool part is that it truly makes you think a
__label__1 This app is awesome! The puzzles are challenging and fun and the pigs are so cute! Works great on my lg optimus v
__label__1 Much more than I expected! Hooked! Graphics, maze, puzzle, concept make this worth it. Droid X. Get it while it is free or you will want to purchase later.
__label__1 So worth the dl. Fun quick puzzle game. Got the song stuck in my head now.Stupid 20 word minimum.
__label__1 Great free game just played for 45 minutes and it was fun and intuitive. Great design 4.5 star in android market.
__label__0 If your a kid under the age of ten you may enjoy it other than that its not even a decent game to waste time with.
__label__1 The first few levels are easy but the later levels are surprisingly challenging, especially if you want to collect all the coins (which you'll need to do to play all the bonus levels).
__label__1 Very fun game and very well made, beautiful graphics and awesome sounds. some levels are very challenging. And for $0.99 it cannot be beat!Some guy gave it a perfect review and called it very addicting and gave it 1 star. O_o
__label__0 I have never used a calendar app like this. Either I am using it wrong or it id useless. Where is the User guide?
__label__1 this app is awsome u put down the thing or date and the time and 5 minutes before that time is tells you what you put down
__label__0 why would you need a note calender....? can't read what day of the week it is when you turn on your kindle fire or phone, seriously pointless..... 1 star for faotd
__label__1 Does what it says it will do. Of course it's somewhat a redundancy in that you could just go straight to your calendar, but this is a pretty good concept. Ok, MEMO to the newbie(s), the FAOTD is usually posted at MIDNIGHT West Coast time, which means 3am
__label__0 First, the description implies that it syncs with &quot;[my] Android device's calendar.&quot; It doesn't. It is a stand-alone calendar and that makes it worse than the stock calendar.Second, if this calendar syncs with nothing at all, WHY DOES IT NEED FU
__label__0 I started using it and found it simple but somewhat useful. Then I realized it didn't sync with my other calendars. UNINSTALL! Thank goodness there is a note feature in my other calendars so it isn't like I'm losing functionality.
__label__1 All I require is a good, independent note style calendar and this suits me perfectly.  It's simple and easy to use.  I have plenty of room to add notes for a given day and can even color code them to keep work and personal stuff separate.  The app works 
__label__0 so I have Colornote Notepad Notes, always a free app, on my Kindle Fire and I love it. it is also a calendar with color sorting like this one. but this one tells me in the notifications what is on my calendar for that day. I have my son's school, scouts,
__label__0 you cant put in a note until the day before....the pictures show nothing on how to do it..... what are the colored streaks for..... JUST DONT BOTHER WITH IT!!!!!!!!!!!
__label__1 My Kindle goes everywhere with me and I find it's a convenient way to get reminded of an appointment when I have my nose buried in a book.  It's an easy to use application too.
__label__0 No way to set up repeatkng events = takes way too long to input for a schedule. Only way to change months is to tap the last day of the month and then use the next day button to get to the first of the next month = have fun putting in events a year from 
__label__0 looks old should be called free crapper of the day..they should be ashamed charging 1.50 for this outdated crap..seriously who picks out these free apps????
__label__1 The app itself is ok, there's nothing really wrong with it, but it's functionality is something that I would use google services for on a mobile device that hasn't integrated it's functionality into the OS.
__label__1 This is almost perfect for me.  I would like to see the US holidays.  It's a very simple, uncomplicated calendar for those of us who don't have abundant meetings or appointments everyday.  It is a competent app, it does what it says.  As far as those com
__label__1 Thanks a lot. I downloaded this thing last night and without a widget or reminder, I forgot all about writing my review today. It's 2:00 and I'm just getting this up. Any idea of the trouble this has caused?!?!
__label__0 Fail! Do not get. I can see why they made this free! I lost 5 minuets of my life with this app I'll NEVER get back!
__label__0 Terrible app. It is difficult to navigate, has only symbols for buttons, but the symbols don't immediately make me go &quot;oh, I know what that is&quot;. I pressed a random button and in broken English it said &quot;you want to do move previous day?&quo
__label__0 Calendar just missing a lot of features that are pretty basic nowadays. Others have already listed them so I won't do that here. I frankly see no point in this program even if it was free all the time. A good application should be able to leverage the te
__label__1 I have been looking for a non-cloud, simple, efficient calendar since I got my tablet!  Thank you.  So far I have no recommendations, it is exactly what I was looking for.  I just wanted to get my rating counted.
__label__1 Well some people don't know that you can set alarms and you can mark dates with different colors, example, you have a work speech on April 1st u can mark it with blue and lets say its a 1 hour earlier then ur usallly at work so u can set the worm for let
__label__1 I really Like this app because you could draw in all different sizes and Colors. I also enjoy how you could share with email but I love to share on neon draw.com the best. great app
__label__1 I love this app it rocks.  if there were more drawing apps I would buy them so I am Addison Minich that is 11 and I love this app
__label__1 This is another 'safe-for-children' app.  The drawings can be saved, and there are some tools available (probably more in the upgraded version).
__label__1 This app just randomly came on my kindle fire so I played it... and I luv it!!! Good app 4 all ages. Rofl (rolling on floor laughing.) :D
__label__1 it is so cool I can name this app 4 ways awsome,cool,sweet,supperfragalistickexpealadoshouse and I whant you to try and name it but not the ones I did
__label__1 You need to get this game!!!If you like drawing then you would love this game.The day I got it I played it for 1 hour!!!!
__label__1 great toy even for big kids (adults)..fun to just doodle...have had a a real fun time drawing this and that
__label__0 did not like, but would be great for children.  not exactly what i was expecting.children would like this it is good for some adults, but i did not care for it.
__label__1 I installed this app cause it was free. I didn't think that my whole family would enjoy playing with it (me included :-) It is alot of fun to move your finger around and watch the rainbow of colors swirl all over the screen. Just jiggle it to clear it aw
__label__0 I am sorry to make this review but I can barely shake it cause nothing happens and when I press the options menu all that comes out is clear share and save even though the clear one helps I still cant do it!!!
__label__1 this app looked ok when I first saw it but not all that great. I saw it was free (witch is wat I was looking for) so I got to try it out. it was great its fun entertaining interesting and slightly hard to make the circles. it is a colorful app and it is 
__label__1 Better than doodlebuddy more glowing colors effects. I just love this app! I use this for notes and when I'm bored
__label__1 Another cute draw program that works on Kindle Fire. The color is beautiful. The app is fun and easy to use. I like this very much.
__label__1 It is an excellent way for me to keep track of all my repairs, fill-ups, etc. I keep it with me at all times
__label__0 This app is very limited.  Lets you enter info on only one vehicle only, and preset maintenance schedules are not changeable.  Ads also show up in the middle of the screen.
__label__0 This looks like a really good app, but to only allow me to keep track of 1 automobile to me is really not worth it...I would like to keep track of at least 2 automobiles...Just my opinion
__label__1 This is EXACTLY what I was looking for! I tried the few others that are free. This is the only one to give me a way to track maintenance on my car, schedule intervals, reminders, etc etc. I am thoroughly impressed with this app.
__label__1 This little program really helps keep records in order.  I was amazed at the many areas it covers.  It give small graphs for us freaks who like to keep complete records of our vehicles.
__label__0 yes, the description lies less than the title, but both mislead. the only reviewers giving high stars are the few developers and their friends. everyone else is giving them a one star.
__label__0 This app falsely advertises itself as a &quot;coin scanner &quot;. It does NOT scan coins at all! Very disappointed and immediately uninstalling from my phone.
__label__1 Perhaps a pre-requisite for owning a smart phone should be being literate. This is a great app that does exactly what it says it will do. It even demonstrates what it does in a photo. If you thought you could scan any given penny and trace that singular 
__label__1 Please reads descriptions before downloading and reviewing.This app scans the coin slab.  Aka the thing you can put the coin in.  Lists the rating, coin, etc for traders and collectors or pawnshops.No where does it say that it scans currency in the descr
__label__0 So a coin scanner, it sounds great.  Endless numismatic joy, a futuristic tool for seeking out new life, or a tool to make my own money with.  Turns out this app is none of these things.  My first thought was to use it on my rare coin collection, but it 
__label__0 dev is an obvious coin collector nerd. learn to name your apps and try to understand that people do not appreciate being misled
__label__0 Title is misleading, and it's definitely done intentionally. I don't understand how some idiots think that people who download this expecting to scan a coin are morons. Ever heard of Google Goggles? Image recognition? The technology exists where scanning
__label__0 the application would be great in a barcoded environment but my old coins are not barcoded. it would have been nice if the developer would have provided a better description but that didnt happen. uninstalling.
__label__0 I could not get this app to work at all. I tried it numerous times, and no prevail. Uninstalled very quickly.
__label__0 put that extra word in between &quot;coin&quot; and &quot;scan&quot;.  not hard at all to do.  its an intentional misdirection brought to you by the new world of order.
__label__1 dont badly rate apps because you are too ignorant to realize titles of apps arent so litteral. smart phones are nice but do you really think they can scan (photograph) a coin that can be 200 years old and from the thousands of different kinds of them? us
__label__1 Runs nicely on both aKindle Fireand anHTC EVO 4G phone.While it works well on both platforms, it really shines (no pun intended) when used on a telephone.When traveling, this app is at its most useful. Use the Evo's kickstand, and it becomes a familiar, 
__label__1 I love this app its time works wonderfully well. I love the whole thing every ting about this app is great.
__label__1 This app is a very useful night time bedside clock for use in those hotels that do not have a bedside clock.  The brightness is very easy to change and the alarm function is also very easy to set.  I appreciate the ability in the alarmclock in that it ca
__label__1 This app is the only thing I found that makes my old Samsung Galaxy Prevail worth keeping around. Leave the phone plugged in and run this app. Have your screen always on while charging and you have a $100 +/- alarm clock that you can use custom mp3's on 
__label__1 Night Clock is an excellent app.I have installed it onto my KindleFireand use it almost all of the time.I use the Landscape view because it can be seen accross the room with no problem.I frequently change the display's color just forthe heck-of-it.I reco

__label__1 olive it it is awesome u should get it beascause it rock you get it I love it you will love it imitate amazing get it please I created this app
__label__1 I love this clock. Others have said some things about the alarm, but I don't use it for that. I love that I can change the color of the clock and that I can just tap the screen to dim it. I use another alarm clock app to wake up by and it works perfectly
__label__1 I can see this as being a handy app to have. Camping or just "in the dark"? This could be your salvation. Has it's own alarm setup system, change colors and 24-hr clock along with numerous other options. Simple, but nice app to have.
__label__1 The night clock is a great addition to my Kindle Fire. It allows me to have a travel clock and a clock I can use for small meetings so all can see the time. You know how we all hate meetings that run past the allocated time.  Very cool.
__label__1 This Is A Great App. I was looking for a basic clock that I could use at night. I do not want to have to spend money on a clock. I have the great alarm  app, so this fits right in with that. It is a nice low light so it does not bother me at all and I us
__label__1 I love this app, the clock is perfect for my room.  I no longer need an alarm clock.  The night clock also works as an alarm, which is awesome.
__label__0 I opened the app and tried to set an alarm on my fire, but It wouldn't let me. it said that my device was incompatible with the alarm clock. uninstalling
__label__0 Well, it's a clock.  The features aren't that easy to use and the clock is way too bright to actually put on the nightstand, but it does tell time.
__label__1 I wanted a full screen clock that I could use on my kindle fire and this app fit the bill.
__label__1 I use this app when I'm traveling because Hotels never seems to have a nightstand clock that has a working backlight.  This app does the trick.  It has a day and night mode to the brightness so that at night you won't be annoyed by the backlight.
__label__1 It's a big, bright, bold and easy to read clock that I can see from across the room even without my glasses.
__label__1 this is just what I was looking.for.  simple and to the point night clock. options to change colors and landscape mode. looking for a night clock, look no further.
__label__1 I needed a clock I can see in the dark without disturbing my sleep and this is the perfect solution for any room lacking a clock.
__label__1 I use this clock every night on the dim mode.  The dim mode is the best part of the clock.  I also love that you can change the font on the clock.
__label__1 I already had a Kindle that wasn't really doing much sitting there on the shelf and I needed a clock but I didn't want to buy one and this app came through and really delivered a great clock app for my Kindle. Now if I could just get rid of that little o
__label__1 This Night Clock app is wonderful.  I downloaded it onto my Kindle Fire and it just works.  I place it on my nightstand and it's like a regular clock.  In landscape mode, the font fills the screen, so it's extra large.  Touch the screen and it goes into 
__label__1 The Night Clock helped wake up in the morning even in Spring.It would go off right at the time I set it at.The best part is it goes off after the time I used it.
__label__1 It's Big, it's nice to look at and you can not miss it unless you are blind. I have a kindle HDX 8.9 and I set it upright and it stays on and looks great on my desk. I would recommend it to anyone. Same goes for my Kindle HDX!
__label__1 This is a great app.  For someone vishally impaired like me it is nice and large.  App easy to load and use.
__label__1 Love it. Travel with it. Perfect bedside clock I can see without my glasses on, with it set upright in a good case. It dims with a touch and is just the right amount of light to find the bathroom without stubbing my toes.I use with the Xtreem alarm clock

__label__1 Simple no fuss night clock with big digits. Great to use also  when travelling. Was looking for something like this.
__label__0 The background screen doesn't black out completely so that no matter how dim you make the numbers the black background area still stays bright. If you are looking for a clock that can get very dark or dim to where you can almost not see it - this is not 
__label__1 I have my Kindle hanging over the window in my dorm room and I have this clock app displaying on it all of the time. It's really nice and convenient.
__label__1 This app is great for seeing traffic on the road before driving.  I usually check before getting into the car to have an idea of what I'm going to be looking at drive wise.  Great app!
__label__1 INRIX has come in so handy when dealing with traffic. I use this App any time I'm in an area where I'm unfamiliar with the highways and local roads and come upon traffic back-ups. Thank you, INRIX!
__label__1 Works as advertised. Cool new features, and pretty accurate data. Really helps while driving. some of the new reporting features are confusing. can't remove them!
__label__1 I have this on my iPod for free, ablnd I love it so much. It really helps relieve stress. Get it! It rocks.
__label__1 Seriously...it worked!! I'm not familiar with this type of hypnosis...in fact I never believed I could be &#34;hypnotized&#34; but this isn't like something you see on t.v.. First, it has a beautiful scene with clouds flying past,a blue sky, and sun that
__label__1 I practice meditation on a daily basis and by far this is the best one I have found to fall asleep with. It is awesome.
__label__1 These are a bit more expensive than some of them out there, but it quality sound, lovely relaxing videos and it is pretty simple to use.I own three of these DM apps and they are all very good quality.
__label__1 I love this app and it's my most frequently used.It's not only helpful if I'm having trouble getting to sleep, but I utilize it and the relaxation app (by the same company) even when I'm already tired.  Both really help me relax and let go of all the ten
__label__1 Was looking for an NPR app for my Kindle Fire. This fits the bill nicely &amp; works great. Recommended &amp; the price is right.
__label__1 This works really well with the Kindle Fire. The streaming content is wonderful for those who like classical, folk, and NPR. Perfect to listen to while reading or playing games.
__label__1 One of the hardest things I had to do when I left NEOhio was to leave WKSU behind. I joined three other stations in places where I lived and they were good.  None came close to WKSU.  And there was nothing like Jim Blum.  Then came Folk Alley.com.  Heave
__label__1 This station is a delight to which to listen.  NPR at its best, along with wonderful classical music.  The combination of news and music is difficult to find on the airwaves today.
__label__1 This app is a charm.  It is easy to access, intuitive to use, and enjoyable in that there are options other than simply streaming the current live broadcast.  I like the options and the sound is good.  I anticipate using this app quite a bit.
__label__0 it is frezzes sometimes  on my Android tablet so i have to wait 4 the last card to turn over
__label__1 i like this app. its fun and can be accomplished by all ages! its great! i deff reccommend this app!
__label__1 I love this game for keeping my 5 and 7 year old entertained. We also like to play it together. It could use a few more levels because hard isn't all that hard but overall. it is a great game. Love the colorful characters
__label__1 I think that this game was perfect for kids all kids would want to play this. review by Mac and angel
__label__1 This app is really cute. My granddaughter is three and loves playing.  The creatures wiggle when she gets them all and she just giggles.  And yes..grandma likes playing too!
__label__1 This one will keep the little ones busy tote quite a while (especially if you play too) .  Creatures are cute and the game helps build attention span.
__label__1 Furry Creatures Match'em game is FREE and sooooooooo cute.  Although the game is easy to play it does make you think and helps with memory.  Easy is easy, but it does get harder at medium level.  THE END OF THE GAME IS SO CUTE WHEN THE FURRY CREATURES AL
__label__1 kids love it! great learning tool to improve memory...and interactive to keep them entertained. we have a great time with it.
__label__1 My little boy loves this and so do I. Its a great way to keep him entertained and help improve memory and perception skills.
__label__1 I downloaded this game thinking it was like the Chuzzle game where you math 3 in a row. I got a pleasant surprise! It's a very cute game!
__label__1 i would definitely and certanly advise you to get this if you have a child and/or have a sibling. this was very hard to rate this cuz my lil bro was begging to play!!!!!
__label__1 Was simple to install. I haven't had any problems with it and it is unobtrusive. No viruses or other malware yet, so I guess it's doing what it's supposed to do.
__label__1 I had searched for an app to use on my Kindle Fire and this one appears to work very well.  I had looked at a few others and some of them I was unable to download and others had negative reviews.  I did not find that with this one.  It seems to be doing 
__label__1 This was recommmended by a family member.  It seems to do a good job.  It scans new apps I download and lets me know if it is safe or not.  I notice it does scan on it's own or I can scan when I choose.
__label__1 FINALLY THIS IS THE SECURITY APP THAT I NEEDED! WORKS INCREDIBLY WELL! I AM SO SECURE IT TELLS ME WHEN A VIRUS IS DETECTED! But if I see one sight of trouble it's GONE.
__label__1 I downloaded this on my Fire last month and its been great.  I feel comfortable that its protecting my device.  It has a constant presence (always On in the background) and you can scan manually, too.  It doesn't consume resources or make the Fire perfor
__label__0 Even though security is hardly an issue on tablets, it is always better to be safe, rather than sorry. However, no matter how ironic this might sound, this security application poses possibly more danger than a foreign application.  Why?  Because it dete
__label__1 I think this is a very effective app, i used lots before, and is easy to use and whats IMPORTANT it DOES what it SAYS will do, nice interfase so its easy to use.A MUST
__label__1 I purchased this to protect my new Kindle Fire and I am satisfied with the level of protection that it has afforded me.
__label__1 It is so cool and it does an amazing job of protecting my kindle!you should totally get this awesome app
__label__1 Haven't had any malware or viruis. Must be doing its job. Runs very nicely in the background and doesn't use up system resources. You don't even know its there. A little slow on a complete scan.(about 5 minutes) I like what I see so far.
__label__1 Cool little anti virus app, and I assure you all that protecting your Android devices from malacious apps is very important. There are malware apps out there, and you must be protected. I once downloaded an app from the internet on my Kindle Fire, and it
__label__1 Glad to have found this type of app for my needs - works well on Fire!  Am very pleased with it!
__label__1 this app is so cute and funny! it made my friend laugh so hard she peed herself.if you asked my opinion I would highly reccomend downloading this app.

__label__1 cats! if you don't want to look at silly pictures of cats don't download this. I love this app when I'm bored, just like the website without the annoying ads.
__label__1 This "Random LOLcat" app displays funny captioned pictures of cute (usually) cats and other critters. Those familiar with the "icanhascheezburger" site will know exactly what type of pictures these are. This is a great time waster as a single tap to the 
__label__1 The animals, captions, and pictures in this app are adorable! Its just I can has cheeseburger.com but on an app, so you don't have to go all the way to the website to get your daily cute, and funny pets.
__label__1 i absolulty love looking at funny/adorable cat pictures and if you do too then get this app because it is amazeballs
__label__1 This app is so fun! I love the cats, but you can choose other categories too. Many of the photos are fun without the captions, and the captions make me lol!
__label__1 that I am crying. I found myself hitting the &quot;save&quot; button on so many pictures to share with people later! Totally hilarious!
__label__1 Now this app is worth the upload. Kitties do the craziest things and my kitty, FAUST, is no exception. Go for this app!
__label__1 This app is absolutely wonderful! I spend a lot of time waiting...doctors appointments, sports practices, etc. and this is a great way to pass the time and laugh while doing it!

__label__1 Who doesn't love LOL Cats?!? (Don't answer that). *I* love LOL Cats! This is a great app for when you just need a little smile. Tap through the Cheezeburger kitteh memes, and enjoy.
__label__1 My two year old loves this game!  He plays it for minutes on end a few times each day.  I am confident he will learn letter recognition using this entertaining game.
__label__1 This is a super duper fun app and your kids will love it and want to play it all the time!
__label__1 My son loves to play this!  He enjoys the sound effects and all the movements of the animals.  He pretends to be all the animals!
__label__1 The moving images and music on this app really draw my attention and the attention of my 3yr old. This is a basic intro to letters.
__label__1 This was recommended by my girlfriend who had it on her computer. My two-year old loves this app and it keeps her busy for long periods of time.
__label__1 my 3 year old loves this.  its simple and identifies what letter he touches in a fun way...he even dances with it!
__label__1 I wasn't sure if this app would keep my toddler engaged or not, but I'm pleasantly surprised how much time she spends looking at all the different animations. I downloaded a lot of different alphabet learning apps and this is the one she likes the most. 
__label__0 No good at all. Felt like an early 90's video game or Atari lol. But we gave it a shot .
__label__1 Next to the African animals matching game this game is also loved by the crew at my in home day care.  Even the older kiddos have fun with it.
__label__1 Great for keeping my 2.5 year old occupied in church so I do not spend my time in the nursery... Love this game
__label__1 This application has way more capability and functionality than the free version.  Do not pay any attention to those who gave it a one.  They are either ignorant or they are mis-representing the facts (complaining about selling price being a rip-off is u
__label__1 Unfortunately the cost of this application is beyond the means of those on fixed incomes.  The limited versions are all we can afford.
__label__0 Why would someone charge for an app when the church provides one with more resources and nearly the same functionality for free. Don't purchase this. This is a copied version of a free app that someone is trying to make money off of. Shameful ...
__label__1 It is easy to use and I like having the other manuals and references.  The marking system works very well,  It is just like having my books with me but not as bulky.
__label__1 I own this one and the app of the same name from Standard Works, LLC. I would steer everyone towards this app. First of all, if you want incredible customer service (I have had to deal with both) then trust me when I say that LDSScriptures.com wins hands
__label__1 I wanted an app that allowed for easy reading and studying of the LDS Scriptures.  This app provides that and much more.  Study is so much easier with the notes and highlight functions.  Would definitely recommend to anyone~
__label__1 Love these Scriptures., Easy to use and like the highlight words and will takeyou to another place in the Scriptues about the word that is highlight.
__label__1 I love everything about it. It has more items than I thought it had. I can mark what I want to. It worked on my device when others would not. Downloaded in a short time with no problems. I would get this App again if I need to.
__label__0 Get the official one made by the Church.  It has a LOT more than this one and it's FREE.  Highlighting...indexing...cross referencing...the whole works.  Get more content for free with the app published by the Church.
__label__1 I have been using the old app and find this app to be a huge improvement. I love this one with the separate books, the headers and footnotes, and the music notes added to the hymn book. I am reading the Old Testament as well as the Book of Mormon in my r

__label__1 I think this is better than the APPs you have to pay for. There are so many things that come on this app.
__label__1 I bought this for my father to use when he goes to discussion groups and to church. He is able to switch between books and verses quickly and finds it very helpful.  Having one object (his Kindle) instead of several books to juggle is great, since they s

__label__1 I got a Kindle Fire for Christmas so I could carry &amp; study my scriptures in a more compact &amp; convenient and lighter way.  I downloaded a free version, it was good and had all the books.  Then I found this app, read reviews, was able to get it for

__label__1 This scripture program with the golden plates cost me $9.99. Yet when I saw it later, it was $14.99.  Did I miss out on something?  So far it is flexible and easy to use.  I can go from book to book easily and quickly.  The hymnal is great as are the mis
__label__1 I don't think I am that much different from others when I tell you I like to mark things up with notes, highlights, colors and other things. I was a little hesitant to spend the money on this because there are free apps and some even allow some marking. 
__label__1 This app contains an assortment of solitaire card games. Application has performed flawlessly and graphics are good on Galaxy S3. Numerous small touches, such as ability to recall move, restart game, etc. really add to the experience. Highly recommended.
__label__0 The Google app store shows a full version, with all 24 games, as well as a &quot;demo&quot; version with just 10 games. What they are releasing here for the FAOTD, only has 10 games. If their description on Amazon had properly listed that it only has 10 
__label__1 this is a solid, small app. customizable, it can be as pretty as you want it to be. game play is smooth, sounds are unobtrusive yet realistic. this app is a keeper.
__label__1 Very nice app, looks great, cards are easy to read, yet to find any bugs or issues. Great fun. Definitely worth getting. EVO 4G LTE.
__label__1 I got this game while it was the FAOTD, and I've played it a little bit.  It is well constructed, and the distinct lack of permissions is nice.  The game does explain the rules in the help menu, but it takes a couple of clicks to find.  The auto-play isn
__label__1 Cards are a very good game for anyone to play.  Since one does not have to pickup and shuffle, the games are much easier and faster to play.  Lot of variety of solitaire and the app was free.
__label__1 Great solitaire app! I am not a huge solitaire player myself, partially because every game I've downloaded on my phone has either been horrible or had annoying ads that took up too much space. I am impressed with the number of different solitaire games a
__label__1 This is easily my favorite solitaire app. The game is fun, challenging and winnable, great combination. Highly recommended time waster.
__label__1 Many thanks to the developers and Amazon for an excellent app.  Works flawlessly, and no permissions.  If you want solitaire for your mobile, look no further.  There are many variations to pass the time; I am looking forward to trying them.
__label__0 so little time, so little game to play compared to all the other solitaire options out there keep looking  good luck
__label__1 I still like Ace Solitaire 2 better, but this one is nothing to sneeze at. :) For a game with so many different versions, it's amazing that the app is under 2mb. I'm sure they could have added some bells and whistles, but didn't. Kudos!Btw, an 'exit' but

__label__1 This game keeps me occupied during those times when I have to wait,........I'm not very patient so it makes the time go by faster.
__label__1 It sure is frustrating -- like playing golf. When you think you have it licked; it bites you in the butt.
__label__1 There are several type of games to choose from. I had no idea there were so many ways to play solitaire. You can also change the front/back of the cards, change the color/pattern of the background, as well as other gameplay features. I would like to see 
__label__1 Finally, a FAOTD which doesn't contains spyware nor wants you to keep paying for regular game play. On top of that, the games are varied, the UI is crisp, and the whole thing just works!
__label__1 I have a hard time beating the Alaska version of this game. I have played hundreds of them and have won a few but at least I have won!!!
__label__1 Nice game with plenty of options, don't understand what the one-star ratings are all aboutAppreciate the effort put into it, highly recommended for any solitaire fan
__label__1 good game with lots of options. May not have EVERY solitaire version out there - but how many do people need? ( see other reviews). Get this while it is free. worth a buck or two if you like solitaire.
__label__1 I have looked at just about all the solitaire games, not to mince any words, BUT this one is the best. Enough about it, get it you`'ll enjoy it. I know I do...
__label__1 Now THIS is how you create a 5 star app!!  No internet, no data mining, no social networking inclusions, no IAP, no CRAP!  And the dev working on changes for us to include one tap moves and no more move alerts, etc., just goes to show he's a genuinely ni

__label__1 it is what it is point blank. it says its solitaire and that my friend is what u will be playing when you open this app. its a different form of it tho. at least for me. I must say that it is fun and I just got it less than a hour ago and have played it 
__label__1 if you like solitaire games you will like this app.  lots of variations and help.  I got it free but it's worth the 1.99 price.  I would recommend.
__label__1 I've tried other Solitaire apps but this one is THE BEST with great features and selectable options.  You can customize to suite your taste and Graphics are crystal clear.  Well designed app has all bases covered nicely.  The only thing I would change is
__label__1 We all grew up on solitaire. But over time many of us became bored with it. This gives you variations on the game and can be both fun and challenging.
__label__1 So many card games in one, I found this to be very entertaining and has helped me fill in the gaps of several HOURS of boredom. If you like Solitaire games then I highly recommend this one, even at two dollars. You will get hours of enjoyment out of this
__label__1 I use it a lot, mostly for spider solitaire, and it works very nicely, even has a help button! I would recommend it.
__label__1 With a great interface, nice graphics, a ton of variations, and no skeezy permissions, this is all you could want in a solitare app.It'd be nice if you could flag or downvote idiotic fake reviews like you can in the Play store so that they didn't drag do
__label__1 I love Yukon and this app does it well. I now have no need for the other solitaire apps. Good job!

__label__1 We've tried many solitaire apps and between the ads, permissions and just plain ol' poor programming, none have measured up.  Except this one.  Love the layout, being able to customize the deck and all the games.  Yukon can sure be frustrating and challe
__label__1 Yukon Gold Solitaire will be replacing the other solitaire game I have been using. This one has less variations but it has all the ones I actually play. It looks better than the other one too. It has some very nice card backs and faces as well as playing
__label__0 the streak counter does not work for the tripeaks game, please fix so I can give this game a better review!
__label__1 This is exactly the solitaire game I was looking for. Glad I purchased it. Looks realistic and there are tons of options! Great solitaire!
__label__1 I just downloaded this app about a week ago, so I have not been playing it for too long, but so far it is great. There are many choices as to which style of solitaire you want to play, they work well and instructions for each style are included. Easy to 
__label__1 Love this solitaire set!  Easy to use and perfect for you if you like solitaire card games.  When they perform an upgrade, they provide a detailed description of the changes and enhancements.  Great game!
__label__1 And it's only for Android!! I love this app!! I play it on both my phone and my tablet. It's quiet, it's fun to play and there are 30+ card games to play in this app. I play Yukon the most, but I can play Klondike, Alaska, Forty Thieves, Freecell, Golf, 
__label__1 Works well on my Galaxy Nexus.  Works well on my Kindle Fire.  I'm sure it'll work fine on my Nexus 7 due to arrive later today.  Looks great and plays decent.  It works well on both my phone and tablet.Thank you for this app.  This title deserves 5 star
__label__0 Went from a 5 star to a 1 star. I have had this game for a long time and always enjoyed it. Recent update has ruined visual aspect. Corners of screen are darker, hints are too large, menus are ugly and harder to read. I won't be playing it anymore. I hop
__label__1 Pros:-Lightweight app, runs on most anything and scales with resolution nicely.-Many game types.-No hidden gotchas, IAPs, ads, or permissions.Cons:- You can go on some pretty long losing steaks!
__label__1 Although this is free today, it has a nice interface, lots of options, and solitaire varieties. If you are looking for something flashy with bells and whistles going off, then find a casino.
__label__0 It's solitaire so you might be asking yourself "how the ding song heck a ma doodle bell can you add IAPs to this?"  Well it would be nice if there was a donation feature. I'd like to give the developer a bit more as my way of saying thanks for making suc
__label__1 I downloaded this a few days ago and it has become a favorite already. I never thought I would get addicted to solitare. lol
__label__0 I've got to say, I thought to myself 'how bad can someone mess up a solitaire game anyway?'  Then I downloaded this and found out. I guess I got spoiled playing 250+Solitaire Collection, which if I remember correctly, was free. It also has graphics that 
__label__1 Excellent app with smooth operation and graphics. Numerous versions of solitaire, all are very well done. On top of all of this there are non invasive per ossions and no in app purchases. I recommend highly.
__label__1 Very nice game. The hints are nice and so are the detailed instructions for the games. Great as a free app of the day.
__label__1 This is awesome! No IAP, no strange permissions, and works great. Finally, amazon is giving us what we've been asking for.Btw, is anyone else tired of &quot;Pete Commando&quot; saying that he wants IAP? It's getting really annoying.
__label__1 Great job guys! I was a little shocked to see no permissions! It thought my phone glitched, our was looking in the wrong place... This game is clean, tons of options, well conceived.Such solid production this game is well worth $1.99! Now if all the othe
__label__1 So many games...so little time!  I didn't even know there were so many different types of solitaire.This game uses very little battery power.  But it's so addicting!  You can play for hours and not waste your battery.If you like solitaire... this is the

__label__0 My dad always told me that if I played with myself I'd go blind. Is that true? I'd like to give this a try, but am afraid of losing my eyesight! Thanks!
__label__1 This is my favorite game to play and relax with.  I play it all the time.  Thanks for providing it.
__label__1 If you love Solitaire, then, you'll not get bored playing this. Plus, with the touchscreen, it is easy to play. The only thing I would like to see different is the leader board (it only shows the high score not the date).
__label__1 Nicely done no crazy permissions lovely graphics keep up the great work......solitaire by definition is a single player game unless you are playing double solitaire so its a good time killer while sitting in the doctors office
__label__1 If you love solitaire, I think you'll love this program. It's simple, flexible, oodles of games, and most importantly it **requires no special permissions.*  I've used this for years. It's my go to game on phone and tablet. I wish he made others apps as 
__label__1 A very well written solitaire game with lots of options, pleasant graphics, no permissions that are intrusive and most importantly... no stupid in app purchases! What more could you want? This is just a great great application.
__label__1 I like clean running, and basic types of games. This is truely one of them. Lots of playing options, but still a good basic game.
__label__1 I've tried others, but keep coming back to this one.  It's tablet friendly and a good basic game of solitaire.
__label__1 Can't get enough of this game. Play often enough, and raising my win percentage.Keep up the good work, Thanks.
__label__1 Really solid solitaire game. In the few weeks since I first downloaded the game the dev has already updated it with some nice improvements, like automatically letting you know when there are no more available moved. The only thing I'd add is an animation
__label__1 This is one of the best Solitaire apps I have found. Easy to navigate, some decent options. I had a Sol game once though that let me go through the 1 card Vegas three times. I wish they would offer that option, whether it's 'real Vegas' or not.
__label__1 no IAP, back button isn't disabled, and no ads from what I can see. interface seems decent enough. thanks devs
__label__1 This app has a beautiful interface, is very well maintained with regular updates, and is enjoyable to play. I can't recall a single time when the app hasn't worked flawlessly on my Kindle Fire or my Droid Razor in nearly two years. Yukon Solitaire is def
__label__0 This game has no multiplayer mode. Why can't I team up with a few friends to do co-op to beat the hard levels, please update... Btw, Yukon gold is a potato, not a card game.
__label__1 Wonderful app.  Has many great games in it.  Well worth downloading. Nice Color and great card backgrounds. This app replaced two of my other apps.
__label__0 really dumb - can't actuall color anything - will only let you use &#34;Halloween&#34; colors - here we go again with needing extra words - no wonder no one wants to review apps
__label__1 uuuummmmmmm..... duh! you have to hit &quot;lines on&quot; to stay in tho lines (even i knew that) and I'm 11 so it is possible to stay in the lines!
__label__1 A great way to keep up on what is really happening in Ireland as well as the US. Stay well informed on what is happening around you.
__label__0 This newspaper should sort things out as this simply is not good enough.  This is a poor advert for the paper and for Ireland.THIS DOES NOT WORKAttempted usage on kindle fire HD 7 inchI would actually prefer to give no star at all.Ppl
__label__1 I needed an FTP interface to copy files from a web site periodically.I like using a "file explorer" interface that lets me easily browse the directory tree and select the files required.The product provided exactly what I wanted.... select a folder on lo
__label__1 This program works great for transferring files from server to my tablets.  I have never had a problem and have it loaded on 3 tablets.  Highly recommended for ease of use and reliable transfer of files.
__label__1 While I normally use scp to do one off transfers on a system, sftp via this little app is great for the Archos 43 that I have.  It handles keys, saved passwords, or prompted passwords.  After a brief look, I got the Pro version.Oh, and kudos for the fore
__label__1 Excellent app.  Just what I needed, I was running low on space and needed to move some movies from my Kindle to my Seagate Home network drive.  This did the job quickly.
__label__1 I've used this app a number of times since installing it.  It's easy to use, and doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure it out.  I definitely recommend it.
__label__1 I was connected to my web folder within 3 minutes of downloading this app. Having my own web storage, I was hoping something like this existed.
__label__1 This is a great FTP client for the Kindle fire and packed with features. It is awesome and quite good.
__label__1 I like this app. It is easy to use and helpful for keeping track of my headaches. I may have to get the full version eventually, just to get better information about my headaches but this is fine for now especially for a free app.
__label__0 This game is not so good please that's a bottom line so loud bad just do not get this stupid GAME.  I. HATE THIS. GAME DO NOT GET IT.
__label__1 I love this app. I bought it on Android Market for $2, and think it's a great price for that and a steal for $1. It's a useful alarm clock, and works well for me because instead of hitting snooze I drive the police car. The graphics and sounds in the app
__label__0 This doesn't have a alarm it's just sirens and a wimpy game. do not buy. The top reviews are totally faked out. I got this because sirens are loud and alarming. Instead I got a police car game with a clock. No alarms just a siren you have to activate man
__label__0 do not purchase.  I. purchased this app. tgen downloaded it. it keeps crashing.  won't even open.  don't waste your money. I DID NOT GET A REFUND. WAY TO GO AMAZON.
__label__0 this game might be worth it if it was free but it is not. if you wany a cool alarm clock than it is great. If you wanted to drive a police car like me than keep looking. The car is impossible to control and the whole road is straight. Again do not waste 
__label__0 Didn't work at all for me.  Didn't even show anything at all in my state when I looked under &#34;K&#34;
__label__0 trying to give us free wifi?? wtf we know how to get wifi by only clicking or tapping, and NOT CLICKING OR TAPPING ON THE BUY BUTTON THEN INSTALLING IT. PLUS U SAY THIS IS FREE? U HAVE TO PAY A DOLLAR 50 CENTS FOR IT PLUS WE ALREADY HAVE WIFI SO WTF -_- 
__label__0 Oh my gosh, a app that looks for wi-fi!!! Oh, wait a second,  can I just go to my settings and do that? Well, they just tried to steal $1.50 from me. Man, that was close.
__label__1 Nice to have wi-fi on my kindle when we travel and ect. It fits into  my world. I  love it.
__label__1 Omg I like love this app! It like gives free wifi for 1.50. Oh I almost forgot its like not wifi. It's like just a list of places with wifi. which is like weird becauce my cell already has wifi and u like have to have wifi to get this app. ... huh what u
__label__0 Do not like. Period no good app. Do not recommend. It doesn't have the information you need.don't get it.  Bad app
__label__0 i did not buy this app,but all it is is a waist of time and money.litsen go to settings on your android device, then go to wireless.there you go get Free wifi
__label__0 Free wifi?!!!! Only $1.50! Is it me, or is this a little strange? Let me find all the free wifi hotspots for a fee of $1.50. Good luck with this app =)
__label__0 this app is a joke. don't get it. read the description before downloading. horrible, bad, garbage. do not download. do not download.
__label__0 first it says free wifi but you have to pay to get a list of wifi places!I hope they relize that people look at things that say free and get mad when they are $1.50
__label__0 From the description, it sounds to me LIKE YOU NEED WI-FI TO GET THE FRICKEN LIST OF WI-FIS!!  Read the DESCRIPTION!!
__label__0 wait cant I just go to the settings to find wifi they almost had me pay 1:50 gee this app really is crap
__label__1 I just wanted to point out the title is Free Wifi when it costs $1.50. So its technically not &quot;free&quot; wifi.
__label__1 This app helped me tremendously,while out and a bout I'm able to get WiFi when and where I need it.
__label__0 Extremely limited and of no use to the person who is seeking a WI-FI station in most states. Does not live up to how it was advertised
__label__1 I love this and all of the other Nubee games, they're addictive and they help to pass time ,I just wish they would bring the games to Kindle!
__label__1 This game is like two games in one.  A slot game plus the coin dozer game.  Alot of fun. Just love it.
__label__1 This is a simple game and I can't stay away from it.  You drop coins hoping to put other coins over the edge.  How simple is that?Try this, you might feel the same way I do.
__label__0 Game was no fun and did not enjoy playing it so  much that I completely deleted it from my computer and KindleFire HD.
__label__1 i really like this coin game. lots of things to collecti and making the slot spin is pretty addicting. i haven&apos;t had to buy any tokens, the free ones last me quite a long time.
__label__1 I am addicted to this game on my phone, but I would LOVE to have it on my Kindle... WHY is it not on Kindle yet??? :(
__label__0 Locked up on first level, could not play anymore. This game was not worth my time.  Would not recommend to anyone.
__label__1 You can enjoy the thrill of slots and a coin game at the same time.  The graphics are exciting and it offers lots of other little items, such as different colored coins, books, and extra coins for your game from a slots win.It is simple to play and would
__label__1 We love this app! We recently got new phones and this was one of the first apps we installed! My hubby and I are in a constant compitition to see who can get the higher level! However its hard to make any headway when my 3 year old is always dropping all
__label__1 this is just like coin dozer but with a twist it is a slot also . get a coin in one of 3 slots and it spins to give you a prize . i like this one better thin coin dozer
__label__1 This is a great tool to have I usually use my phone but it doesn't have everything I'm needing to use when calculating items. I recommend this to everyone.
__label__0 I hate this app. This not a good Calculator. Do not ever get this app. Waste of money and space. For some reason always puts decimals in there all the time. Stupid APP!!!!
__label__1 I do not use this app, all that often but I have found it to be effective and thought it works very well.
__label__1 This is something that everyone should have because everyone needs a calculator sometimes. I use this calculator at least once a week. When I was doing my charity fundraiser, I was very glad to have this app so easy to access.
__label__1 This app was free for one day and I downloaded it. It's a great basic calculator. I'm not sure if there are advanced functions or not, but it works for what I've used it for, and works well. I haven't had any problems or issues with it, and I like it. Th
__label__1 I love it, it is so easy to use and so many added options. I will tell my friends about this app.
__label__1 I had seen ads for these electronic Bibles,but this Christmas when my wife gave mea Kindle Fire HD, one off the first downloadable was this. Immediately I searched for favorite verses, highlighted and went over several times.I was awed by the reading too
__label__1 The NKJV Bible has been faithfully and fabulously done with all the care and finesse it deserves - I now use this version as a parrallel and it has everything I look for..., and more.
__label__1 Enjoy this version of the Bible.  Very easy to navigate from Book to Book and Verse to Verse. Cost was worth it.
__label__1 The NKJV Bible is easy to understand and speaks to me with a clear message.  It is a good source of information to help people have a more clear meaning to the classic KJV.
__label__1 I've only had app a few days but so far I'm enjoying it.  Lots of info and easy to use
__label__1 NKJV Bible is easy to manipulate. I adore the fact that I can make notes and highlight. This allows me to reread my Sunday School lesson or sermon that was presented.Tracie
__label__1 This is an excellent tool for my Bible study. I use it many days during the week. It is easy to use & responds quickly.
__label__1 I love the way I can have two versions open at the same time, side by side, and easily compare versions.  I like the way I have all my Bible versions, my study Bible, and devotionals all at my fingertips.  No need to switch between apps.
__label__1 I love this bible and I also got the Message Bible.  Wi-Fi is not needed and these two bibles work well side by side in Church.  Highly recommended.
__label__1 The app has many features which I also use when I do a comparable study out of my personal Bible study including being able to highlight verses and take side notes. I recommend this app for Bible students of all stages of their growth in the knowledge of
__label__1 I use this the majority of the. Time.  It is so easy ....I love it. It works as an audio book too.
__label__1 Great app for reading, taking notes on verses, sharing favorite verses, making comments on shares.I especially like the ease of parallel versions, comparing verses and highlighting.And it is very simple to use, while having so many functions.Extremely fr
__label__1 I downloaded this as one of my first items. Love the easy access and it was very easy to read and navigate through. I would recommend this to anyone who wants an easy to read Bible.
__label__1 I love this version of the Bible and I also love the way that it will move or go down the page as you read, which also may be changed to go faster or slower as you read!
__label__0 I use my Kindle for my daily Bible reading time, not for Bible study.  I have a KJV and this NKJV and I like to switch between them and compare wording, etc.  On the KJV app you go to where you want to start reading and reading is continuous, that is you
__label__1 This Tecarta Company has produced a wonderful Bible Program that this app and many other Bible Versions can be installed. This NKJV is what I use to preach from and if you choose some of the other Bible Version Apps - you can quickly move from one to the
__label__1 I think this is an excellent Bible. Easy to locate books, chapters, and verses. Good reference Bible. Easy to read.
__label__1 I really like this bible version for my kindle hd.  I find it a bit easier to use than the YouVersion bible. With this bible, your not required to go online, you can read it anyplace. And to make it a parallel bible, you do have to choose another bible o
__label__1 I have looked at lots of Bible apps but had not found one like this where I can highlight only one word or I can make a note that will attach to the very spot I made the note.  Lots of other goodies.  The only down side is that every translation costs mo
__label__1 i love this app bcuz its easy to navigate, highlight, and take notes. the best part is the parallel feature. plus its works on all my devices. i cant say enough good things about it!
__label__1 Truly decent Bible app.  There is a slight learning curve as to how to access various Bible books but once that is figured out, then it is a wonderful tool on one's Kindle and certainly less cumbersome to carry around than an actual book.  These &#34;pag
__label__1 I have this on my Kindle Fire and it works so awesome! It's so easy to navigate. There's night/day settings, audio settings and also where you can take notes and highlight verses etc. I have just started using this app but love it already!
__label__1 For those people who want to read the Bible and understand what you are reading this is the Bible to get. Don't listen to those people clergy et.all that say &#34;If the King James was good enough for Paul it is good enough for me&#34;. They don't know w

__label__1 This is a very easy to use and browse and is usable offline. Highly recommend. Will use as goto NKJV.
__label__1 I have been using this app (Bible) since November of 2013 on my kindle fire HD. This app is wonderful, I'm still new to tablets but I can find everything I need, you can highlight in different colors,it has good navigation to each book or verses. This is
__label__1 This is a fabulous app.  So easy and quick to search, you can bookmark and highlight passages, change font and size as well as have it speak.  Super nimble, pages turn quickly and easily.
__label__1 I have used many different bibles in digital format and this is by far the best. There are lots of options available to make your study of God's word easier.
__label__1 Love it, glad to have another choice for reading the word.So nice to be able to take it with you, to appointments, on a trip, wonderful
__label__1 Use this at home and also take it to church - it is &#34;quicker to turn the pages&#34; as the Pastor speaks thenhaving to turn paper pages.
__label__1 after my Bible fell apart,  it dawned on me to use my Kindle Fire instead of searching for another. this app was highly recommended and I must say,  I love it!! very easy to use and I particularly like the margin notes that readily available. I also like

__label__1 Great Bible App and easy to navigate through. Has alot of features that are useful for Bible study.  Easy to locate individual verses.
__label__1 It is a great tool when you are in Church or anywhere. It has helped me to keep up with the service and in Bible Studies. and the audio help me pronounce words that I didn't know before. I love it!!!!!
__label__1 Love this item. Easy to use. I would buy this item again. Wifee has it on her I-pad. She love it also.
__label__0 Definitely seems like a spam app to me. Just shows the logo; no loading progress or anything else. Download size is way too small to include any music anyway.
__label__1 A fun game if you like music trivia. what more can be said download it play it if you don't like erase it (got to love free games)
__label__1 love it !!!!!  alot of different type of songs  by knowed artists, good sound would reccomend it to everyone, easy to use.
__label__0 Not sure if it is a user error or an app error.  I tried downloading to my kindle and to my computer.  I got nothing.  Oh well.
__label__1 I've been hoping this app would be offered as app of the day. I have this app on my ipad and my kids and I love it. It is harder to use on the smaller phone screen vs. the ipad, but my kids won't care. Thank you Amazon and Darren Murtha Design for offeri
__label__1 its very cute I'm a tern and I love it but so does my ten year old sister its fun and lets kids of all ages get creative and use their imagination has lots of neat tools and you can save to your gallery and on the app I recommend this app to others
__label__1 It's just a fabulous app.  Great for any quick finger drawing you need to do and great for kids too.  Any less than positive reviewers want some full blown tablet form of something like Adobe Photoshop for $1.99/free.  Bottom line is that for the price i
__label__1 Excellent FAOTD and would be worth the $2 if I had a young child or was fond of doodling. Thanks Murtha!
__label__1 I just downloaded this app and my kids think its amazing. It's all the art fun without the mess! Highly recommend it!
__label__1 My 3 year old boy LOVES this app.  Great for waiting in a doctors office.  It holds his attentionfor a good amount of time
__label__1 I've had several of these type of apps for my LG Optimus phone and this one is by far the easiest to use! Its easy to navigate, draw &amp; save without any directions! Thanks Amazon for an amazing FAOD!!!
__label__1 My give year old and up love this app! The possibilities are endless with all the backgrounds, stickers and colors. I will say resizing the stickers is harder for me as it's very precise. I would love to see more girlie stickers and an android sticker, b
__label__1 Works great on Tmobile G2 even with its small  screen. This app must be amazing on the larger screen of a tablet.  This is a great creativity application,  very intuitive, easy to use, great graphics and worth every penny.
__label__1 this app is great for when ur going somewhere and u want to draw or scribble.....also it has every Color in every type of ustencil
__label__0 don't expect this crap to be worthy for an older artist. no brush sizing? no Color picking? hell, no freaking zooming in/out? no thanks, get out of here. waste of money
__label__1 My family loves this drawing app! Its built for ages 0-infinity. ;-) It has everything you need for a child and adult to doodle to their heart's content.
__label__1 My twins who are 4 absolutely love this app.  My son loves the stickers and my daughter loves the paint.  I love that they are also using this as a way to practice writing.
__label__1 Versatile app allows both children and adults to indulge their creative urges without needing a tutorial or a lot of innate talent.
__label__1 This is by far the best drawing app I have tried.  Everything is great: the interface, the graphics, the selection of tools (markers, pensils, stamps, stickers, and more).I am using it on my Toshiba Thrive and I am very happy with this app.  Definitely r
__label__1 I was skeptical about this app, expecting it to be either weak or difficult to use. This app was both very intuitive and provided a multitude of methods to draw/paint/stamp/etc.  I love it!
__label__1 very nice app! my 1 year old loves doodling on the phone. this is awesome! love the color, type varieties and stickers? nice~
__label__1 free app of the day - amazing features. worth even to pay for. gotta try it on my tablet sometime.
__label__1 Out of all of the drawing apps we have tried out, this is by FAR the best.  It is very user friendly and my kids love it!  I love the &quot;drawer&quot; that holds paint brushes, colored pencils, stamps, stickers etc. in a wide range of colors.  I've con
__label__1 Very good game. Lots of expensive stuff In here that is FREE! I love this get it it has stickers, paint brushes, completed pencils, and much more.  :)
__label__1 I am an artist and paint with acrylics.  This program is very clever and a lot of fun.  It has a very nice assortment of media and it's uploadable.
__label__1 I thought it was a simple drawing app but in fact, it gives you different options that makes the strokes realistic. &#60;3
__label__1 Thank u. Amazon.Exactly what I was looking for,  A simple Drawing Pad that has all the tools my son likes to draw with. Hassle free. I love it.
__label__1 Enjoy this app as an adult and Sure it would be loved by kids.Would recommend it for all ages.
__label__1 so fun. i love it, I have a kindle fire and its a nice artistic way to show your talent.
__label__1 The only thing missing is the ability to add your own photos. It has stickers, markers, paint... Definitely the best drawing app for any phone! Did I mention the only thing it wants to read is the data it writes to your phone! LOVE IT!!!!
__label__1 Wonderful app with a wide variety of tools to keep little kids busy. There are tons of colors of markers, paint, colored pencils, stamps, backgrounds and stickers. Easy to use.
__label__1 This app deserves loyalty by it's fans! I love this app so much! Feature rich and stickers, backgrounds and erasers! Amazing!
__label__1 this app is really fun. it has lots of color choices and different writing stuff. the backgrounds are also really cool. Love it!!!!!!!
__label__0 Extremely difficult to control, cannot get a fine line-cannot erase.  Probably great for toddlers or very young child.  Too frustrating for a 7 yr. old.
__label__1 Truly enjoy the Drawing Pad.  I can't draw a lick, but it's fun to play with.  You can draw, play word games or even paint, there is a lot to do with this.  I love it.

__label__1 You can share your art work on Facebook and even print out for the fridge. I love this for my son when we are sitting at a restaurant waiting for our food. Great for all ages!
__label__1 i got this app the first day i got my kindle fire last christmas. it is amazing! i love the cool options like color pencil, crayon, and paint! worth the money
__label__1 Well thought out and excellent use of touchscreen device. Great selection of drawing utensils as well as great selection of paper/backgrounds.
__label__1 We have downloaded several drawing apps, but this is the one we use the most!  Gives so many options on color and style of stroke, def recommended!
__label__1 My girls love this. They get very creative. Now I just have to manage the fighting over whose turn it is.
__label__1 This app is perfect pretty much in every way! I love the tools menu with pictures of the art tools. My kids aren't going to want to give my phone back. This is a fully-realized app. App devs take notice, use and learn.
__label__1 Trust me when I say I know what lousy customer service is and what good customer service is. I had this app on my stock Nook Color. This developer was incredibly responsive to my situation and now I am enjoying Drawing Pad on my Nook Color running CM7.As

__label__1 I downloaded this app for my grandchildren but discovered that I love it for myself. I can't wait for them to try it.

__label__1 works very well on my kindle fire! It's cute &amp; fun. Easy to use as well. I always check out the free ap of the day and was excited to try this one. So glad I did! Can't wait to test it out on my students tomorrow!
__label__0 Bought for 6yr old daughther and you cannot use it on a kindle fire. So we bought something we can't use. Our mistake I guess should have read it a little more closely. So beware read all details before you buy.
__label__1 Each & evertime I open this up I am entertained and inspired. Really a terrific deal for it's modest price ! Highly reccomended.
__label__1 my 4 year old loves to draw using colored pencils, markers, crayons  and add stickers, and stamps. This app has it all except the fridge magnet to hang my Galaxy Tab onto it with :DApple is well known for kids apps being very well done and I agree but th
__label__1 This game is a lot of fun.  My six yr old loves playing it.  She has so much fun playing this game.
__label__1 I have the sketchbook pro app and this one is easier and more enjoyable and intuitive to use. Sure, it probably has less features, but when I compare the ease of use the other one doesn't come close. This is well worth buying even at more than the asking
__label__1 This one is a cool app for messing around with drawing or similar items.  Can spend some time messing with it.
__label__0 THIS DOESN'T WORK DON'T WASTE TWO FRICKEN DOLLARS LIKE ME I GOT THE APP AND ALL IT SAYS IS SUCKER!! YOU JUST WASTED TWO DOLLARS!! ITS SO ANNOYING!! DO NOT BUYYYY THISSSSSS
__label__1 this app is really fun. every age can play it and be creative on it. it is totally worth $1.99 and I love using this app. what's different about this app then most drawing apps is, u can choose to draw in paint, colored pencil, or Crayon. u can also have
__label__1 I am an Artist.  Drawing sketches on sheets of paper was getting too much.  I like the Drawing Pad because all I have to do is erase my sketch if I'm not happy with it.  Then start over or erase a portion I did not like.  It did take me time to get used 
__label__1 This is one of the best art apps I have tried.  With choices for type of drawing/painting tools, different background, colors, etc...there are many unique ways to create high quality designs that you can save, publish or send to friends.  Simple enough f
__label__1 This is a FANTASTIC ARTIST Dream. This App. is what every Artist should have downloaded on their own Devices. I as well, would recommend that  this app. be used by parents to help their children learn about art and colours. We all have an artistic side o
__label__1 It amazes me how well it really works on a tablet. I wasn't expecting Photoshop, that's not why I got a tablet. But for quick fun finger painting type of artwork, it's just amazing.
__label__1 I love all the choices you have as far as tools to draw with, graphics to choose from, and backgrounds to choose from.  You can save your drawings as well as share them.  You can even print them out if you want.  Lot of possibilities with this app!  My 8
__label__1 this app is fun to use, for kids and also for adults. it gives a real feeling and has a lot of options and is easy to use. great to get it free but also is worth the normal price.
__label__1 This app has saved me at dr appts, on trips, and just around the house on a rainy day or just wanting to doodle. My 3yr old loved using this app to show us how he writes his name & ABC's. He enjoys coloring shapes & playing with the sticker pages. He rea
__label__1 No lag and smooth controls. Great for 7 dollars. You should get it by all means! More coming later for this app.
__label__1 I really love this app - colorful, easy to use, save, doodle - whatever your heart desires.  I didn't know I needed an email app to send my drawings and when I contacted customer service they replied within minutes, super helpful and friendly!  Love it, 
__label__1 this app might be expensive but its fun.its the best drawing app ive seen on the kindle so I think u should buy it.
__label__1 I really like this drawing app. It is very easy to use. It is fun to use and great for when you are bored and just want to play around.
__label__1 I have read some of the comments and I am not happy. So what if it does not have a bigger and smaller line size and I'm over seven years old and it does run on the Kindle Fire. GEEZ PeopleI love Drawing Pad =)
__label__1 well this app is the best.  i love it.  It has a lot of colers and marcers,crans,pait,and colered penciles. Amazing app love it.  you shoukd get it.  also you can save your your pics into a booklet that u can print.  i lobe this app tortaly love it. :-)
__label__1 importing photos would be a big plus, but this is a great app for drawing or painting. Stickers are a nice added feature.
__label__1 This is a great app. I like to draw on it. I think there are a lot of fun ways to make your drawing better. Highly recommend app and I don't understand why people gave this a 1 star rating. If 10 stars, I would give a 10/10.
__label__1 I recomend this app to everyone!! I love it!! So many color choices and ways to draw. Love the stickers and stamps! This is worth two dollars!!
__label__1 keeps my kid busy for hours on end. Need to get some shopping done give this to your kid while in the cart will keep them busy so you can get your stuff done.
__label__1 This was a great app and I recommend it for anyone who likes to doodle and who has kids. My daughter who is almost 3 enjoys drawing and using the stencils and other media available for drawing and coloring.
__label__1 This is an awesome app! I have several drawing apps on my Kindle, but I really like this one because of all the different options they give you for brushes and markers, stamps/stickers and backgrounds. Very fun!
__label__0 Don't download, it screws up your phone. It doesn't download properly on Droid3 and then the download update stays on the screen until you uninstall the amazon appstore app completely and reinstall it.
__label__1 So worth $2.00 you can draw anything so fun!!! It even has stamps so so so so many colors to choose from there is no other coloring app to get this is the best I'm telling you!!! Get it believe me!!!
__label__1 Its great for all ages and great for kindle fires!!!! Don't fall for all the other dumb drawing apps, this is the very best and u will LOVE IT!!!!
__label__1 Love this app!  Great for writing with a stylus /finger and illustrating.  It has pencils in all colors, markers, crayons, paint etc.  many colors and types of papers to use.......has ruled tablet type paper which k-1 grade writers need for sentence and 
__label__1 For one if you delete an app it automatically removes the icon for you unlike stock folders which you have to do manually. I repeatedly download and delete apps so this was a pleasant surprise bonus for me. The fact that you can make the folders look any
__label__1 A good program for organizing your apps in to folders. The folders icons can have any of a large stock of images. I like that this program asks me if I want to put a new application into a folder after I have installed one. Only complaint is that it take
__label__1 It's rare to find something that is both beautiful and practical. This app meets both. If your launcher doesn't support folders by default (long-press on home screen to see if it does), this is your solution.
__label__1 Love this app had it for about a year now would never do without it!HTC Thunderbolt withGo launcher
__label__0 there's no sense in getting this unless you actually think making a folder with the built in folder option is too hard. why people actually pay for apps that do something your phone already does in the first place is beyond me
__label__0 Way too hard to figure out how to use.  No help or documenation.  About to uninstall..glad I didn't pay for this c**p
__label__1 Simply an outstanding folder based shortcut manager for your android phone. Think of it as an easier to use version of Folder Organizer featured here a few weeks ago.This program allows you to have customizable shortcuts appear on your home screen. Insta
__label__1 Great app for grouping icons to save screen space. Great app...using it on all devices. The included icons makes each grouping easily identifiable.
__label__1 I would definitely pay for this fantastic app! I can now put my games in one folder, most used apps in another, news links in another, and put the folders all on one screen. One screen! That leaves me 6 screens to do whatever I want. I made 4 folders for
__label__0 i began having a lot of problems after downloading this app recently on its free offerring on the daily free app feature of amazons app server application. as soon as i uninstalled it i was able to open amazon apps again without it force closing and have
__label__1 This app is great!  i skeptically downloaded this FOR FREE after reading mixed reviews.  i&quot;m so glad i did!  my home page iS very organized now.  and i can easily get to and find my apps.  You wont regret this download.  Thanks Amazon for giving it 
__label__1 I generally have two folders on my home screen. One for games and the other for fitness.  I found this app good enough to replace stock folders.
__label__1 Absolutely the BEST app organizer I have ever used. This is a must have for every Android user. Now I can finally clean up my home screen and access my all my apps without scrolling through the app cache for those apps I can't fit on my home screen, or d
__label__1 Finally something good from Amazon free app of the day. Love the easy set up for folders. Better than the one before.
__label__0 like others, I too am wondering why this app wants to access my browser history and contacts. other file organizers do not.
__label__0 While it does do a cool thing, that is organize apps, you can already do that. from the home screen, select menu, then personalize, then folder. Voila. Why take up more precious memory with something you already have?
__label__1 Slick interface, very useful if you have a lot of apps. Easy to use. Get it today for free. Def worth a try.
__label__1 GREAT APP.  My 7 screens were full and now I'm down to 1 screen.  I set up categories and moved all my apps into those categories, making it so much more easier to find my apps.  Set up is a little slow process....but well worth it.  THANKS!
__label__1 awesome app. got rid of that stupid stock folder. now I can organize and move loads of apps ... glad I found this. totally worth it.
__label__1 To the people who say that this only offers the same functionality thats already built into Aos are either idiots or didn't bother actually using the app.  1.  It allows you to customize the folder icon to anything you want.  2.  It allows you to put the
__label__1 I have been using this for years and, after the initial setup and once you understand how to use it, it's great.  Installing an app automatically asks you what folder to put it in and uninstalling automatically removes the app from its folder (if you cho
__label__1 This app works beautifully on Sprint Samsung Epic. Love all the customizations to folders you can do. The icons you can choose from are many and what a smart idea to clear home screens of all those apps. Thank you for an intelligent, great working app. F
__label__1 This application allows me to group all of my apps into logical folders and keep everything accessible from my home screen.No more searching for the app I want!  I am using folders for: Driving, Work, Games, Utilities, Health, Quick Dial, Kid Games, Reli
__label__0 As this is a application organizer what business does it have reading my contact data?  I decided to not install so I can't comment on the app itself.
__label__1 I love this app. Does everything I would want a folder app to do, including prompts to add any freshly installed app to an existing folder. Sortable, editable, custom looks, badges for number of apps per folder. Above and beyond what stock Android offers
__label__1 This app is easily, by far and away, the best folder manager app I have ever used on Android. It blows the built in folder manager out of the water. They're not even in the same league.Using this app has completely changed the way I use my phone and orga
__label__1 Not a simple app. That is what makes it a gem. I use it for keeping track of over a hundred apps. Constantly using out. I would like to be able to add my own folder icons or have more provided.
__label__0 The good: I like the clean white interface that pops out of the widgets.  The bad: Everything else. way too many steps to add things to folders. The icons? They're ridiculously small. Can barely see the little pictures on some of them. The variety of ico
__label__1 I do not know about anybody else but this is exactly what I have been looking for. The old filesystem was boring in this at least gives a little bit of life to your desktop
__label__0 So disappointed with the app, was expecting so much more customizations, not worth it when the phone can do it for free, such a waste of space and resources on my phone
__label__1 The Widget breakout on the is both a clean and profeasional look to the menu. I have tried three other organizers and they pale in comparison to the app.
__label__1 Much better and less buggy than the Folder Organizer App they gave away free a month or so ago.  The included icons are beautiful, and the widgets are great and clean.  Very well done app.  Almost feels like a new phone.  Epic 4G
__label__1 Not a lot of stock folder options can rival this. Even custom launcher folder options have a hard time rivaling this. Would recommend this to anyone who is into using folders.
__label__1 Works very well on EVO4G. Great dynamic folders option. Found adding and creating folders very easy. Newly installed apps very easy to place in previously created folders.
__label__1 Organizes apps.  For us Type A personalities, it's right up our alley.  Using gallery pics or images downloaded from internet,  one can customize desktop uniquely.
__label__0 I have bought folder organizer few months back.. so comparing with it.. GUI is comparatively good.. but  this app is slow to open folder.. Also one HUGE function missing is to keep folder open after you access some app from it.. e.g. if I have stored new
__label__1 I really liked this app. I've downloaded others prior and found them to be not as user friendly. this was definitely worth the download!
__label__1 with a variety of icons and the fact that you can add so many apps into each, name every icon, then choose layout whether it is scroll view window horizontal and light or dark when you tap icon, it is truly one of my top three favorite apps. They have up
__label__1 enjoying it so far, I love the ability to make my folders look so beautiful. Not to mention create the ones with the little preview next to it.
__label__1 I prefer this over Smart Shortcuts actually. The folders are much cleaner looking and there's several options as to how the shortcuts show up. Only problem I can see is that there isn't enough icons.
__label__1 while there is a bit of a learning curve to this, it is a must have. Unlike the stock folders created by Droid, if you use this, all icons stay in place if the phone is restarted. totally worth the money. Love it!
__label__1 Great app. Simplistic and easy to use. You can have personalized icons for the folder. Different ways for the look when you open the folder. I love this.
__label__1 I have been looking for a good application organizer and this is it.  I tried 3 others but they were not intuitive enough.  this includes customizations that the others don't.  I especially love being able to customize the actual icon on your screen.  gr
__label__1 But the work flow isn't as efficient.Also, I wish it auto-notified like Folder Organizer so that I can put apps in their correct places right after install.Still 5/5 stars for very smooth scrolling performance!  I have 83 app shortcuts in 1 folder and it
__label__1 Great for grouping , news version ads more folder styles, I already had people at the office drooling over it..only thing I don't like its the message on start up about illegal downloads every single time.
__label__0 Your android system already provides the same ability of creating application shortcut folders. This application is completely unneeded. It's a really annoying trend I've seen in Android app stores not just in amazon.
__label__0 the icons are to generic for me. sticking with the stock folders app for now. I may try some of the other apps mentioned by other reviewers.
__label__1 This blows the stock app out of the water! Easy to use, is fast, and pretty much flawless. 2 things make it stand out:1. It puts recently downloaded apps at the top, making it easy add them to a folder.2. It highlights the apps that are already in a fold
__label__1 Devices:  Acer Iconia A500 Tablet and Samsung Epic Touch (SGII)It is very useful for the phone because of the screen realestate.  But I also use it on the tablet to organize my applications into categories.  Before I installed Application Folder Pro - I 
__label__1 This is a must have. I was holding out on a folder app because I was too picky, but this is just what I was looking for. Very customizable and looks great with my phone setup. Droid X
__label__1 Me parecio una excelente aplicacion muy interesante.... facil de usar... excelente apariencia.....NO produce FORCE TO CLOSE.... corre muy bien en mi DROID X
__label__1 initially it took a little while to understand and explore this app. Now I have neat folders with choice of icons and views which makes accessing all my apps so much easier. I like both the shortcut and widget options to access the created folders but pr
__label__1 This app is absolutely a must have if you have a lot of apps! Not only does it allow you to organize your apps into folders,  but prompts you to assign a newly installed app into an existing folder, and removes the entry upon uninstalling.The only downsi
__label__0 This is close to unusable. Similar apps let you create folders by dragging one icon onto another. This thing makes you go through a complicated process I still don't understand. Life is too short to figure out how to use bad software
__label__1 i checked the android market and they only have the free version on there, and its a more recent build, so why is this one an earlier build and it costs money?on the bright side, this is one sweet app, do yourself a favor and download while free, you wil
__label__0 I love this app, and have used it for years. Pro version. After phone reset, I noticed this version didn't have Folder Editor, etc. I found the Lite version in the Play Store, and run both to get Pro features like backup, various folder styles, etc I'm u
__label__1 I had downloaded many folder management Apps but each one was lacking in functionality or looked bad.  This app gives many display options and has cleaned up my display.  I love it!Only bad thing is lack of documentation, but after a few minutes I figure
__label__1 Had now for four hours and its the best. Has allowed me to free up so much space and organize the folders so easily. Love this app.
__label__1 This app is awesome, it's a neat way to store files without covering the entire screen. You can file your most used apps into categories of folders and have maybe 1-3 widgets on your home screen with your favorite apps in them. I made 4 folders 1.Message
__label__0 Couldn't get it to work. Didn't have time to waste trying to figure it out when there are better alternatives out there.
__label__1 i especially love how i can use my own pictures as customer folder pics. I use a neat app called &quot;Pic Finder&quot; which utilizes google images to find whatever i want. i save the thumbnail, and voila, instant folder pic for Application Folder Pro.M
__label__1 love the game but need help desperately getting through level ten can anyone help me I cant control the sliding to go were I want to I want to keep playing but I can not get past this ice level...  help please...
__label__1 Kids and I love it! Good game, it occupies my five year old when needed. But all around fun to play with and without the kids! :)
__label__1 i like games that r puzzles but pigs thats amazing B) My favorite puzzle game. im going to call this piggy puzzles
__label__1 One of my favorite game's I've been playing for month's on the free one now all of a sudden it won't load ...can you tell me why?  Katre
__label__1 if you want a good challenge for your brain you should totally get this game. loved it. the pigs help you solve the puzzles which get harder and harder as you make it past each level.
__label__1 bludvlgrl.  Stumbled on this game while browsing.  As others have said it is a fun problem solving game. Can be frustrating when some of the elevations aren't apparent andyou trap yourself.  I quickly learner to save my game at several intervals througho
__label__1 It is fun and silly. I can play it and let my 3 year old granddaughter play a little to make her happy. so good for alot of age groups. the story line is cute!!
__label__0 Graphic very poor, game play is lame. Don't waste your time with this one, there are much better games out there
__label__1 Since I collect pigs, to my delight I discovered this game. I played it almost non stop!  Great game for all ages, even this older woman, heh.  I'll highly recommend this if anyone asks which games apps.  What's  more? This game is FREE!
__label__0 not for me ..not my kind of game...just tried  for something new. stick to what I like and know ok
__label__1 I got this app from the other market a while back.  This is by far a fun game and great app.  It worked flawlessly on my vibrant.  I never had to contact the dev, but I read in the othet market reviews where people did.  Not sure if the dev got back with
__label__1 i like this one because its a lill scarry for my daughter so it opens her up to the horor factor w/out scaring her, & helps her stratigize.
__label__1 This game is just like the video said, full and free. I play this app more than any other app. Definately get it, especially if you like problem solving.
__label__1 Great maze game.  Lots of levels.  New twist and strategies needed for each level.  Silly and fun, sometimes tough.  Love the puzzle.
__label__0 I would have gave a zero rating but I cant so this thin is suckish I'm never playing it again even though its right there once again people don't buy it sucks I hate.you people that made it its harsh but its right
__label__1 this is a great time waster it is fun but it is hard to know what is what but that shouldn't stop u from buying it!!!!
__label__1 I recommend this game because it is challenging, yet fun. It feels like you're in a real restaurant!!! I really love how you actually cook the food. Please get this game for fun for all ages!!!
__label__0 this app isn't really cooking, its putting fake food on stoves. Not worth it.:(The app is just customers asking you what they want, you putting food on a stove, and anannoying voice telling you what to do.
__label__1 I love this game!! You have to think fast and keep ahead of the orders. Even the Easy setting is challenging.
__label__0 i got this app thinking it would be ok, it turned out to be the worst.i deleted it cause it was being dumb and there's this anoying voice that tells u what to cook.DO NOT GET THIS APP!!!!
__label__1 This game is so addicting and time consuming! I absoulutly LOVE this game! My parents own a restaraunt, and they cook the food in the kitchen sometimes too, so now I know how hard it is to cook! Except, it's much harder in real life... But, still, REALLY
__label__1 I L-O-V-E THIS GAME IT'S SO MUCH FUN U HAVE TO GET IT I'D GIVE IT 500 STARS IF I COULED OH AND YOU MEAN PEAPLE BACK OFF
__label__1 happyneis spereds in this app year after year I give a good fourteen to this vary app it is vary fun
__label__0 Such a boring waste of time. I don't think I played it for even 10 minutes before I deleted it.
__label__1 I love it its so fun and addicting and its totally free I recommend it to anyone who buys it
__label__1 When I played it I loved it very much.It's awesome. Napoleon is the team I like.I will. make the. Napoleon's food.
__label__1 I love this game... its nothing flashy just cook what's ordered as the game progresses orders become more complex but u can challenge yourself... pretty cool
__label__0 All you do is tap things... tap the ingredients then wait. then tap the pan and then a ate. SUCKS. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME DOWNLOADING!
__label__0 Entertaining for  a child but didn't hold my attention because they is nothing to it. It is not interesting  enough for a cooking game. No strategy at all.
__label__0 all those people That are saying the app is great are most likely lying to make them look better than every body else. I do not recommend this game to people that want to play a cooking game. I have tried to like this game but is impossible. stand of foo
__label__1 The sounds of it actually cooking makes this game really interesting and fun. If you love cooking or interested in cooking this will be fun to play.
__label__1 I love this time management game.  It is really great.  But I think it is better if you play it with the sound off.
__label__0 this app is not fun at ALL!!!  all u do is tap the food then the stove. and u can NEVER cook it without burning it. u only have literally an1/8 of a second to flip it. the lady's voice gets really annoying and she tells u &quot;hurry up&quot;. this is th
__label__0 i found this game quite boring. it was too simple and wasnt a challenge. i would not recomend this game to any of my friends
__label__0 all i can say is this app freaking ducks I mean it sucked worse than a vacuum! no offence to the people who like it though.
__label__1 I have to admit,this is a pretty good game. I'm not the best at it right now but it is getting better each time I play. I cook much better in real life,though. tee hee hee :)
__label__0 for all those people that say this app sucks they are so right I mean when your at a restrant and your foods late you don't say hurry up you just wants there and wait for food
__label__1 If you are not good at multitasking you probably wont like this game.  I happen to love it.  I okay the hard version for awhile then the med and easy.  I enjoy trying to better my score.  Also I play on a Kindle Fire +it works great.  I have used it a lo
__label__0 Makes annoying noises to humans but not mosquitoes. Simply put, this is not an effective way to combat those peaky mosquitoes.
__label__1 Got the app. Turned it on. And I can hear all frequencys.Cant wait to try this app. Hope it works.
__label__0 the frequency range of phone or tablet speakers is very limited, I don't see how this could work. But just for fun is OK too.
__label__1 We went to watch fireworks outside, and everyone else used the spray stuff except me, I used the app, and I didn't get bit once! most everyone else did. I'm in Texas btw so it works for the mosquitoes here. It's Awesome!
__label__1 This is actually really good. Its a book and you put in your email address and they send you great tips on everything about music. I like it! Its VERY helpful! If you don't like it then just delete it. And you can press something to stop receiving the em
__label__1 Please mind those very negative reveiws this app works fine if you're a very patient person you will love this app
__label__0 this book just tells you take music lessons what a waist. Now I have to put up with the icon. I wish I knew how to get rid of books I do  not like.
__label__0 you cant get the first one to work the others you can so your like &quot; what am I supose to do here.&quot;
__label__1 great app. didn't want to install at first, but it is now. my two year old loves it. it will enyrtain him for 30 min or more!
__label__1 Loved teaching my nephew about new animals while we waited for the doctor.  Kept him entertained for over 30 minutes.  I settled him down with this app after Nana  got frustrated and was at her wits end.
__label__1 This is such a great app to have!! My 2 year old loves it! It is easy to use and a great learning tool for little ones. Great for trying to teach sound association!!
__label__1 My little girl started using this app at about 9mo. and still uses it now at 2 years. She learned soo much and was using new words everyday when she began using it. i am tight on cash so i only get free apps for her but this one was WELL worth the money!
__label__1 I promise it is worth it. My son has loved it from 6 months to now at 20 months. Even my older kids play with it.
__label__1 My four-year-old still plays with this app even now. We got is a year or so ago and it was essentially then, the only app he play with on a regular basis. He loved hearing all the different sounds and associating them with the world around him. He is ver
__label__1 I really liked this app when I first downloaded it as a freebee.  Even the "lite" kept my little guy pretty happy. Bought the full version... that has been worth every penny and then some. The only thing I would have added initially was a voiceover sayin
__label__0 Had the free version, worked great but my daughter kept opening the ads. Bought the paid version and it doesn't open, force closes every time we try it.
__label__1 A favorite of my 2 yr old grandson.  He plays with alot of aps but always starts and finishes with Sound Touch.  It is fun and a great learning tool- no mess, no lost parts, etc!
__label__1 20 month old grandson has been playing this app for about 8 months now! Started with the free app, and Just unlocked the rest. He has learned alot from this app! He loves animals and can growl as well as the cheetah, LOL!
__label__1 My 3 yr old grandson loves this app.  He will sit for hours and play this!  It is just as entertaining as it is educational!  A must for every young child!
__label__1 My 18 month old loves this. She will spend hours touching the pictures and hearing their sounds. Very educational and entertaining for babies.
__label__1 My nineteen month old granddaughter absolutely loves this app and has been using it for the past six months. Here is why we both like it:1. There are six different screens: domestic and farm animals, jungle and ocean animals, birds, different modes of tr
__label__1 Mega Bible Dictionaries by Ian Vink is an excellent book. I like it very much and highly recommend it! It is great!
__label__1 Mega Bible dictionary was very well designed to allow one to navigate easily in ones quest to find meanings. I found it easy to search and pick words that I needed to learn extensive information on. It's a very resourceful app that will assist you in res
__label__0 Has only one version of the promised 24.  Freezes when searching and forces shut down of app.  Tap bars, if that is what they are suppose to be, do not respond.  No way to change settings.  I am totally disappointed and especially perturbed that it canno
__label__1 ANYTHING THAT HAD TO WITH GODS WORD I TRULY THE LORD I'D AND WORTHY TO BE PRAISED THE ONE ONE AND ONLY ROCK.
__label__1 This has also the scriptures in it. It is very informative for a christian or anyone looking for answers about the bible.
__label__0 I am so disappointed in this app!  It advertises many versions of the Bible and you only get 1.  Aside from that, the search feature is worthless.  It merely sits there spinning saying it is searching and then after a time a box will pop up saying it has
__label__1 Mega Bible Encyclopedia by Ian Vink is an excellent book. I like it very much and highly recommend it! It is great!
__label__1 I also know how to read and learn about the Lord to know him is to love him .love him
__label__1 This also has the bible in it. It is a good tool for someone looking for the answers for themselves or someone else.
__label__1 Great resource, sermon help and bible study help.  Everything I need to help as I study people, places and things. Areas of interest are explored and explained.
__label__1 When all I had was a little iPod, they were on it and helped me relax.  Once I got a kindle, I searched them out again.  A great collection of meditations.

__label__1 This app features podcasts that are informative and gives you a wide variety of current and older ones to chose from.  Many of the podcasts are meditation guides and can be used by the average meditation student.  Reasonable priced and high quality.  Rec
__label__1 This is a wonderful app.  And Mary's voice is so sweet and calming.  There are many meditations there, for every reason you might think of, and some very short, some longer.
__label__1 I have to say...I have always had a hard time relaxing and falling asleep because my mind just won't be quiet. But I am usually asleep before any of these meditations are half way through ..
__label__1 The Modern King James Bible and Multiple Histories of the Christian Faith, all in a single app.  Normally, you would need a fairly large bookcase to store the entire library of dozens of volumes describing how Modern day Christinity came about.Such thing
__label__0 This app is something that I am surprised that Amazon has on there web site. It does nothing that it says it will. I wasted my coins when I bought it and I wish I had them back.
__label__1 I hope to live and Lear n about his presence and kindness and glory will learn to love the lord
__label__1 This is a great resource. It containes more documents than I will probably ever be able to get through. But when it comes to the bible I like to have anything that might come up in a conversation.
__label__1 I am amazed by this wonderful Christian Bible Library.  So much to learn in one place.  I am blessed to have this library on my Kindle.
__label__1 I appreciate the opportunity to have this library of resources and references available in such a compact form. It is especially useful when traveling. I'm assuming all of the volumes included are in the Public Domain and could be found individually if I
__label__0 Note: I am not a professional drummer by any stretch of my imagination. But the slow response time and tinny sound turned me off from the beginning.
__label__1 Finally a good drum app I've been looking everywhere for one and if you're someone that like the drums get this don't waste your time on other apps that cost you money just because you think if it's worth money it's better well some times it is but in th
__label__1 I think this is a great drum app. its a little small on the kindle fire, but there's no lag, or at least not on the kindle fire. I'm just dissapointed that I suck at playing drums :-(
__label__1 My kids love this App , I do too and I'm 43 and know nothing about music.. They play it regularly and works and sounds great on their Kindles !!!! Easy to use also....
__label__1 totally fun! everyone can have fun with this! make your own music or play along with a song that is playing on the radio!
__label__0 I don't remember getting this.  Can it be removed from my Kindle - Was there a fee for this product?  I have no interest in drums and really don't want the program
__label__1 This is the best drumming app for kindle fire hd out there. Must get this app. It's my favorite music app
__label__1 This app is really fun!I can rock out loud and play my beats as loud as I want to!My inner drummer was released in a cool way!:)
__label__0 This is lame. The sound of each drum or cymbal is weak. I would rather bang on a big bucket.
__label__1 I got this for my 12 month 2nd cousin's son to play with at a dinner party that he was not happy that he had to attend
__label__0 I'm a drummer and I have never seen that many cymbals on 1 drum set. Also, it you try to hit 2 things at once, the sound either gets delayed or stops for a few seconds.
__label__1 My 13 year old grandson downloaded this to his Kindle Fire, and uses it all the time, he loves it!
__label__1 This is a good drum app that works well and sounds good.I downloaded it as I was looking for an app to practice some drum circle style drumming and there are enough choices of drum kits that I found the sound I was looking for even though this app is not
__label__1 Love it. Totally cool!! Needs &infin;  stars. Also its.....FREAKING FREE :pu should get it. You can also record and name your own songs. Get it now!!
__label__0 DO NOT DOWNLOAD.  Horrible!  I wasted all the time downloading just to see that it didn't work worth a crap!
__label__1 I sosoo play the drums with this you plug in your headphones and boom instant fun. Ringo should get this app
__label__1 This app is awesome!!!! I can't stop using it! I recommend it for everyone, I love it, its the best thing ever!:-)
__label__0 Disappointing. I downloded a pic on my kindle fire,  but it didn't even work. If you have a kindle fire, this app is useless..........
__label__0 when u try to change the color of the eyes in pictures it lookes terrible... all it is is a freicken colored circle over the place u marked.. eyes will never look like the picture that u see next to the name.. yaeh the picture is off the cover of a book 
__label__1 this stuff works I love it I have took some extraordinary photos with this app very efficient so good! hahahh
__label__1 This was an interesting app, there was nothing wrong with it,just not what I thought it was or wanted. Thank you.
__label__0 Don't get it. The circle for your eyes just randomly dissapears and it is really a worthless app... Wont do what I want it to and was uninstalled quickly.
__label__0 Don't waste your time on this app...O.m.g. it is sooo o.m.g. there are no words to describe this LAME app. I thought it would be cool, but it is the complete opposite. You don't really change the colour of their eye, it's just an extra ring around the ey
__label__0 I downloaded this but it dosen't work good AT ALL!!!!!! I was a waste of my time.I could give you 1million bad reviews of this so called ''good app''but just done't install!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !
__label__1 for the free simple version its what i expected. it works fine for changing eye color. i had no problems with the app or it working on my kindle fire. i think its cool thnx ethan
__label__1 it is cool I don't use it on people I use on animals. it looks cool but weird! thank you animals!
__label__1 This app is really fun. You can change the pupils of other people's eyes and it looks real. Plus, it's free! I recommend. this app because my little sister LOVES it!!
__label__0 soo fake and stupid! I mean, its not even funny how fake and cheesy this app is! awful! awful! AWFUL! do NOT get this!
__label__0 I tried to select a picture and I got to my pictures and tapped one but it would just take me back to the main screen. I was very disappointed in it. :(
__label__1 This app is so cool! I have really, really dark brown eyes, and who knew that with a tap of my finger, I could make my eyes my favorite shade of green? If you want to highlight your eyecolor, add some intensity, and attract some &quot;Wow!&quot;s, this a
__label__0 this app sucks. Eyes look SUPER fake. Don't waste your time. I mean it looks like when you take a Crayon and try to color over another color. its a mess.
__label__0 its a scam!!! it looks so fake not even bright enough to look dramatic in red.!!!!!!!!!! worst app ever. its so bad.the good reviews are fake!!!!!!!
__label__1 I found this app a berry cool app for people that love art and making things colorful. I love art myself and found it verry apeeling.
__label__1 I really like this app I can play it all day it is one of my favorit game I think you shood get this app it is todoly worth it
__label__0 It's stupid, it doesn't even color your eye's.you take a picture of your eye's and then you put these circle things on them, you choose what color you want your eye's to look like and then the little circles just change color.it doesn't even look real.
__label__1 get it. it is awesome. works great on kindle fire. it is free.so just get it. yeah yup GET IT!
__label__0 Just get a drawing app.  You're going to spend so much time editing their "layover" so that it doesn't just look like someone scribbled on your photo that you'd be just as far ahead editing via drawing app.
__label__1 they showed up in math skills are outside your friend no its fine bet on this site are the rope and how she isn't doing in math skills and the search engine optimization and the yahoo dot the USA and how to find the hunger strike a purple heart of work a
__label__0 It worked but then again it didn't.when I tried it , I didn't see the difference even though my eyes are dark brown and I wanted them to change to blue.
__label__0 This looks so fake. Not any good at all. At least I did the free app first. Friend has another tablit with an app that changes eyes looks real and it was free. Not offered yet on kindle :(
__label__0 there is no camera on the kindle fire. I wanted to make my eyes rainbow but I couldn't.this app sucks!!!!!!
__label__0 I don't know its Linda hard to use it its so impossible!! come on make it easier so ppl can actually like it
__label__0 its realy hard to use on smaller pics. I would not recommend you download this app. it was a waste of time to download
__label__0 If I could give this a zero I would because it is so fake looking. Oh and if you think about buying the pro version it is a waste of time and money. They should not use fake pics to get you to buy it. Thank God it's free
__label__0 This app is a total ripoff. Even if it is free. It only puts a transparent transparent circle on your eyes. If I could put 0 stars, I would.
__label__1 i was dissappointed with this app as I couldn't find the connerstone lesson study. please work on providing the connerstone,primary,collegiate sabbath school lesson study on this app. otherwise excellent job on the app.PS- you might want to refine the th
__label__1 Thank you for offering the Quarterly in digital form. Now I have the bible, quarterly and all of EGW books to take to church and anywhere I am, can't ask for more. Free!
__label__1 I love my quarterly.  I can have it handy any time any where with my Kendal or my andorid.  Keeps me up to date on my studies. Thanks so much for making it available for the Kendal.
__label__1 Now I can do it often and easily.  It is just so convenient to be caught waiting somewhere and just pull out my phone and catch up.  No more wasted time standing in lines...use it to read and stay connected.
__label__1 If you don't want to carry your Sabbath School Quarterly with you to church and already have a Bible app on your Kindle, then this is the program for you. Works very nicely.
__label__1 This program is awesome. The only improvements I can think of would be to correct whatever problem there is with the companion Bible program and make the teachers guide available as an option.
__label__1 I have this in Kindle and also on my android phone. This is a great app that  every SDA should have.
__label__1 The electronic quarterlyis very helpful to study God's word when you are on the go every day of the week.
__label__1 I really like this app.  At the end of the quarter just uninstall and re install and the next quarter lessons come up.  Great app!!
__label__1 It is just great to be able to have the quarterly on the go. No matter where I am I can study each day's lesson. I just love the accessibility of it.
__label__1 I am so pleased to study my Sabbath School Lesson on KindleFire. I will have the lesson handy nearly always, the Bible verses are right there too! Thank you so much.I got it today because I did not know this quarter was avalible until now.
__label__1 I use this daily and highly recommend it. It will be even better when Goggle make scriptures work on the Kindle.
__label__1 For me is the best way  to study and learn more about theme in the discussion the sabbath  class. I recomend this clases to everybody who has the opportunitiesto have a KindleFire.
__label__1 I love this app! It is absolutely wonderful to have the on both my Kindle & my smartphone. I am disabled and recovering from surgery, so even when I cannot get to Sabbath School I can easily follow along and not worry if I didn't get a quarterly in Sabba
__label__1 Another great product for us to use in order to study God's Word. I like the fact that it updates after each quarter so that I can have the next Quarterly without hunting for it. Thank you!!!!
__label__1 This is an awesome app!  It's wonderful to have my lesson quarterly with me at all times so that I can study when I have a break throughout the day.  I do love it.
__label__1 It's very easy to manage and meet my expectations! I'll be using it very often for my worship and Bible stud
__label__1 Rated high, because it is a daily guide to be used.Am able to read it any time.love it
__label__1 I have been studying my Sabbath School lessons on my Kindle Fire.  This app loaded quickly and works great!  I even get daily reminders at time I chose.  No complaints.  I highly recommend it.
__label__0 it dnt evn look real!! yhu can tell its sssooo supper fake!!!! bt really juss look at it &amp;&amp; ii mean really look at it, evn from huere yhu can tell its soo F A K E*carman*
__label__0 The Sound is not good and it is a very disappointing app. It could be so much better but it is not.
__label__1 CHAINSAWS ROCK I CANT WAIT TO SEE BLOOD HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA THIS IS GONA BE FUN I WILL ACT TO KILL MY SISTER AND SHE WILL BE SCARED I JUST KNOW IT THIS IS AWSOME SO GET THIS!!!!!!!!!!!
__label__0 playing on kindle fire hd and it is great fun but crashes after 4 mins of game play. please fix
__label__1 This game is so fun.  Too bad it has a little glitch.  Deal with it. It is not even a major problem
__label__0 o mean ive sewn a game like this one, and I loved it. but I don't know there is something about this app that isn't as speaking as the last game. hmmmm... manet its that UOU CANT DO BARLEY ANYTHING WITH IT!!! I warn you don't get this app.
__label__0 its definetly a fun app. I would be willing to pay for a version that does not force exit too. I played the Java version, but this is definatly better, except for the force exit.
__label__0 I got this app and it kept lagging. what is the point to lagging? Awful game, it made me want to burn my kindle fire.
__label__0 its a really fun game but on my kindle fire I will click on the app and it just turns off!
__label__0 I have to keep it on small I think it just is that it takes up too much of your memory but actually it is a piece of crap game So just to warn you DO NOT GET THE GAME
__label__0 I love this app as does my son, but it only worked for 20 minutes. we have had it downloaded for weeks but it wont turn on. just goes to black screen and auto exits. please fix this really cool and fun app.....please.
__label__0 It is really really bad I recomend doing nothing than playing this trash:( It is just really bad no fun at ALL
__label__0 this game stinks when you click on it, it brings you right back to were you wereI recommend you don't get it it is just a waste of space
__label__0 this game is boring and won't. stay up on my kindle fire. lame and stupid.after a while it won't. even pull up.
__label__0 I like this app, but I was really upset when it started to have a lag, then, when I try to get back on the app, It doesn't let me back on the app! I got me so mad. This app is ok, but it would really be nice if they fixed the lag and if I could get back 
__label__0 I downloaded this game a while back and it crashed and stopped working so I redownloaded it to see if it would work then and it didn't.
__label__0 this game is really fun use to play it on my Pc but this app dose not work it force exits all the time to the point of it not being playable
__label__0 This is a lonely peace of poop first time it restarted itself second it works fine but then again some jerk turn it off then it won't work
__label__0 Copied from an app called "The Powder Game". Do not get this app! Get the real version instead.(Disclaimer: so far as i know,"The Powder Game" is not available in the Amazon appstore. If you would like the real, actually working version of this app, then
__label__0 Within 5 seconds of playing it, it closes itself. Willing to give it a second try, it closes again within 10 seconds. This app would be great if it didn't crash. Until they remove all the bugs: uninstall.
__label__1 I'm only giving this 5 stars because of the pure awesomeness but really, PLEASE FIX THIS APP! It shuts down every time I turn it on!
__label__0 This is a great app... for the 45 seconds it runs before shutting down.  If the stability issue is ever fixed this will become a must have, but until then it isn't worth downloading.
__label__0 There is a way better version of this with more options Ana  everything  online  called dustbin  it doesn't crash but I guess it's ok
__label__0 i will totally pop your gellies. totally just sayin. reviewing your stuff. gtfo and whatever review and ha review yeah ok bye
__label__0 FUN FOR A SHORT WILENEET TO BE MORE CHANANGING.nEED MORE MEAT IN THE BONE FOR THE GAME (MORE FUN)
__label__1 This is a fun and addictive game. Very challenging. Makes you use your brain. Recommended for all ages 5 to 95 .
__label__1 Inever played this so i don't know what to rate i just wanted to counter the two star with a five star
__label__1 I really like this.  It doesn't't stop and ask for money or tell me I need to wait for more lives! Fun fun fun!!,
__label__0 I'm serious... I download a lota useless apps, but... this one is worse than the worst app in the world, bey. fifb cicvr ric eud ddjdje e such dwid dEric sod d eifhe eididic f ejdjcic. ehfudbr fjfhfhfudhd r r fvfuchr fbfur e r rbfhr. rhfufvr vfhfu f dhcu
__label__1 it suck so stupid waste of ur life and it os so cool i love must buy great game it sucks so good so by now and by chaos my usure name is russ12299
__label__0 What is the point of this app?  I mean really it's useless, just a waste of space on your device.
__label__0 this is sooooo stupid.DO NOT GET THIS APP. VERY STUPID AND A WASTE OF TIME. SAVE URSELFGET A CALCULATOR. it more entertaining. if I could, I wouldn't even rate this a 1 star.
__label__0 ya it can be addicting but if u swing it. it stabs and if u.jab it it makes the swinging sound. DONT GET IT&iexcl;!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
__label__1 With this great simple little app I learned the alphabet over night &amp; then used it to master it completely. I couldn't ask for more at this price, well worth the money.  I wish this developer would create this app with word signs to give those of us 
__label__1 My daughter is learning ASL as am I, she loves this app, I hope to see more app's for ASL study and will certainly purchase them!
__label__1 I have taken ASL and forgotten so much.  Never very fast at reading finger spelling.  This is the perfect tool for practicing.  You can repeat the words, choose slow, medium, fast, choose the word length.  I have improved a little and hope to improve a l
__label__1 It looks as though it's marketed towards children (and even uses a childs hand), but as an adult who doesn't know a lick of sign language, I definitely appreciate this app. From what I can tell it only teaches you letters, so if you already know all your
__label__1 I've been using this app for a short time.  I is so much fun and easy to use and  very helpful in learning ASL.  I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to learn ASL.
__label__1 This is an excellent product to teach small children or even adults who are starting out!I would truly recommend this to all.
__label__1 finger spelling!! great job!!! iam learn how to sign. i dont know that much, but it help me.Great job! thank
__label__0 This was advertised to go w/Word Help to take shots of the gameboards in Words w/Friends and it doesn't work that way.
__label__0 took a bit to understand but when I got the hang of it, it worked okay on my kindle fire ... but ... the 525k Pdf is so pixelated its useless. could not read any type on it. so am taking it out.
__label__1 I love how online on my kindle fire I can turn website into a pdf file for reading offline. then I can open it on my pdf program to read and its saved.
__label__1 Great product when you want to capture a screen shot.  Would love it more if I was able to name the files.
__label__0 This app &#34;reloads&#34; the page as it takes a snapshot. So, if it's a page that requires logging in, then this app takes a snapshot of the log in screen only. This is worthless.
__label__1 This is a very useful app. With it I can load a we page using the kindle browser and then choose to open that we page in this app. Then I can choose to save the whole we page as a PDF. Most useful. I went to a web page I wanted to save and was able to ca
__label__0 I have tried this program on two different tablets. It will not download Bibles. Just will not work on either of my Android 4.XX tabs.
__label__1 I was looking for a easy Bible app that you could access without the Internet. My sister suggested this one. I have liked it since and would suggest to anyone who is looking for one such that is easy and no-access Internet.
__label__1 I use it with my Sabbath School Quarterly everyday and I love how it highlights the text I am reading. It is also great by itself.
__label__1 This Bible app is better than other Bible apps because it is well organized. It is easy to go from one verse or book to another. Highlighting works well and scrolling is smooth. I am very pleased with this app.
__label__1 The title says it all I love this app.I personality think that everyone. should get this app.Also I think that the sabeth app thing was awesome and with this it is even cooler.Thank You!
__label__1 I'm not a religious person but this Bible is exactly what I was looking for whenever a religious debate comes up because you have the NT in Greek as well as the complete Vulgate in Latin and even a Hebrew version, so it is great to look up the original v
__label__1 What a neat app!  I love how it's linked to the quarterly so that lesson study is at my fingertips....thanks.
__label__0 I got this app because it offers the Torah. The app dies every time I try to access the Torah. I must remove it from my device and reinstall if I want to look at any other translation (after trying to view the Torah). I see no point in keeping this app a
__label__1 very fun game and very addicting. it is also very easy so it wont be a challenge even for kids. still i love it.
__label__0 This game is very boring. Not much of a challenge at all. It is very slow, I would not recommend this game at all, very Boring. Maybe for a little kid but did not satisfy me at all.
__label__1 Many other apps I've purchased before would get killed with my, Task Manager, or Task Killer not this one. It's great! I have teen boys and having the ability to let then use my phone to talk and be assured that they don't go into the internet and get in
__label__1 First app for the Kindle that works as advertised. Ive tried others and all they do is screw up how the Kindle works. Easy to understand. Easy to use.
__label__1 I purchased this app to have the feature that once I enter my code I don't have to enter it again unless the screen goes dark. Worth the cost to protect the content on my Kindle Fire.
__label__0 Got the app free through the Appstore. I tried play, but GB app didn't respond to the screen tapping. To be fair, it might be my Polaroid PTab7200.
__label__0 will give a better rating if I am able to run the appI don't know what this app is about but I won't be able to fund out until it has nexus with ics  support.
__label__0 not fun at all. feels unfinished - a work in progress. not enough to it. technically speaking it does work though.
__label__0 The title of this review says it all.  this game won't run on an android 4 device.I'll be happy to re review this after the program had been updated.
__label__1 people need be peaceful and try get free app 20 are more minutes after midnight then it will likely be free cool game thanks developer for a cool game
__label__0 After about 2 minutes of this rather boring game, my Fire locked up, had to restart it, do not want this app near me!
__label__0 this game sucks the controls are poor and the graphics are wat a game would be 1000 years ago don't waste your money
__label__1 I like it. its the rummest game ever to me that's why I rate it 5 stars I love that game
__label__0 For this POS game!  I am ashamed to say that I even tried it!why was some lamer allowed to post this
__label__1 This might be a fun game and might be worth the money however, since it did not work on my galaxy nexus I'm going to fairly assume its rubbish. It shows the developer's title and then stops unexpectedly.
__label__1 enjoyed playing for awhile, cute game that takes a little skill, my grandkids will love it....really worth it for free!!
__label__1 Even though it may need a little work, it is defenetely not a waste of time, especially when it is free. If you like to play reasonable games, this is for you.
__label__0 Won't even open on my Transformer running Ice Cream Sandwich. Just crashes every time I try to open it. Uninstalling for now.
__label__1 And honestly I'm not disappointed. Today's menu featured schnitzel which was extremely delicious! I am still looking forward to sinking my teeth into some flavorful, juicy, chicken in the near future though. This game is weird.
__label__0 As mentioned by another review, it would seem this game is not compatible with Android 4.0.  Please look into fixing this so those of us can play this game.  At that time I will be happy to revise this review.  Thank you.
__label__1 This game has great graphics and great gameplay. Controls work smoothly, and it's very addicting. Thanks to amazon and Myriad for a cool game.
__label__1 Not the best game in the world but Deff not the worst. At 50 cents i would recommend. Runs fine and does as promised.
__label__0 I know that most users have capacitive multi-touch screens, but many devices do not.  Most apps are designed to work on both types of screens, but not this app.
__label__0 It won't work with my Galaxy S 3 Mini. I suspect the phone to be the issue in all honesty.
__label__0 Does not work on Polariod Andriod Tablet. Tried to install four times and followed calibration instructions. May work on Andriod phones.
__label__1 This app works like a charm, for me, on my Fire!  I don't see what the big bbad reviews are for.  You obviously did not bother to actually download the App!  I like it a lot!  It is far better than Easy Money, which I have on my phone...
__label__1 One of several apps not optimized for my phone that seem to work fine. (I get the Faotds anyway so I'll have the apps when I upgrade. Some work, most don't.)As for the app, it has a clean interface, well done categories, a bill reminder, and password pro
__label__0 the naming and icon of this app are rather ironic as the most fitting description of it is: cow pie
__label__0 this app stinks do.not buy the app unless you want to be complclied.this.is just the hard way to do something
__label__0 terrible. couldn't even get it to run once, just kept crashing and restarting my phone.  T-mobile G2 || Cyanogenmod 7.1
__label__1 Really? Okay, I agree, this is a lame faotd, but rate on how it works! Seriously, talk about immature!Okay I did downloaded this but I really made this to counter the lame spammer Superman and the rest of his lame followers.However, I do KNOW for a fact 
__label__0 Moola looks good but has too many permissions that look like they allow theft of sensitive data.  Finance Apps need to be secure utilities, not possible data mining tools for the unwary prey.This is decent enough for a FAotD, but I think I'll stick with

__label__0 who represents a personal finance app with the Icon of a cow!?!? seriously Now I want to drink milk, 1 star for faotd for no entainment, false advertsidment, and making me thirsty!
__label__1 As someone who has trouble remembering how much money is in their account, I find this app to be extremely helpful.Nowhere do I see anything forcing me to surrender any personal info, unless of course a trip to Target counts as sensative personal informa
__label__1 Thank you for trying Moola Personal Finance by Moola Inc.  I love this app and so will you!Be sure to tell your friends and loved ones!
__label__1 I've read reviews about how they think this app is spam or going to steal your stuff etc. After testing this app and checking it out the app is clean.  I have lookout pro on my phone it passes the initial install as well as the privacy security check I h
__label__0 Save your money: hide your children, hide your women; there is a thief on the loose, and he wants your private information AND $4.99
__label__0 how sad is that? I would NEVER get an app that has this many reviews online about data loss. beware! all over the net ppl are saying that this app looses data constantly and responses to complaints have gone unheard. to the developer who left the comment
__label__1 frreeee3eeeeeeeee I sassssssssy joking bye the way I love it because I purchased it for freed so creel the buuuuuuuuurrrrrrrn
__label__0 Can't believe I got woken up by a phone call at the crack of noon, no less on the day after attending a St. Patty's party, from a friend whining to me to review the FAOTD before they download it.  After I had my coffee and a packet of Goody's powder, I b
__label__0 there are too many apps that will not run on the lg optimus that unless we all rate it 1 we will be a forgotten phone and left behind. fellow lg optimus users need to stand up and say work harder on supporting us!
__label__0 seriously? the price went from 5$to 8$!!! if u really need to pay 8$ for a saving money app, you need to go to a bank instead.
__label__0 doesn't work on kindle fire wish it did could have been very helpful very sad..........I have tried others that seem to work but....would love something different
__label__1 Moola, (or as we like to call it- Moomaw.) helped me greatly when planning our St. Patti's Day parade. (We spell Patti with an i for extra detail.) It was the most puce-filled parade our town has ever seen &amp; was full of unicycles of all girths &amp;

__label__0 I am rating this application a 1/5 because it does not even come close to a stable application. I gave the app, one star because it was free. If I would have paid five dollars then it would've been rated a negative ten out of five. Have a better day by N
__label__1 this was the free app of the day a while back.  so glad I downloaded it.  very useful and I use it daily
__label__1 I love this app,its great. now I have something to manage all of my bills. I'm not the best when It comes to remembering my bills are due.
__label__1 I was extrememly excited when I saw the icon for this app. I just knew it was a Chick-fil-A coupon app and am always looking for Chick-fil-A coupons. Unfortunately, upon downloading, I discovered it's just another personal finance app for people with mor
__label__0 who needs a cow to tell them about finances and other crap? and I was so excited that this would be a fun game app called moola until I actually looked at it. I am disappointed in you, amazon. you and moola Inc. suck.
__label__0 this software supports accounts with one currency only and has no exchange rates.  and what can i do if i have an account in the US and one in Europe,  because i work with Europe and many of my expenses are in euro? answer: i can't use it.  uninstalling.
__label__0 UPDATED:I'm not going to list the available features for this app as they are numerous & cover just about everything one should need or want in a financial app, including password protection.Because I don't feel comfortable sharing my personal banking & 
__label__1 The game is beautiful and the gameplay is excellent.  Highly recommended for anyone looking for a popping style game.  The adventure mode is really fun.
__label__1 I didn't anticipate that I would enjoy this game as much as I do.  The quest mode is especially fun.  It has replay value by mixing up the game modes between classic, puzzle, strategy, time, etc.  It also provides different goals for beating a level as a
__label__1 Flawless and addictive. This is the best appstore freebie yet. Some games crash the Atrix thanks to AT&amp;T but not this one.
__label__1 I wasn't sure about this because there wasn't any reviews, but I'm glad I went with it. its fun. a board game meets tetris.
__label__1 First OF game I ever bought.  Happy to have it working on my Samsung Tab.  All the extras are icing on the cake.
__label__1 Definitely worth downloading.  Playing on Droid Incredible and have had no problems.  I have played this on the PSP and I actually prefer it on touchscreen.
__label__0 Does not maximize to full screen on Motorola Xoom.  Nothing happens when I press on menu buttons, so I can't even play the game.  Uninstalled.
__label__1 I've played this on my Thunderbolt for a long time and LOVE it.  Great way to pass 5 or 15 minutes.  Wish it worked on my Xoom, but so glad I have it on my phone.  It's a keeper!
__label__1 At first I thought it was just one more clear the tiles game. The developer cleverly turned spun it into a mission. I found the Quest mode to be close to irresistible. I did finish in a few days but logged way too many hours each day. I recommend this to
__label__1 Have a version of this for my Nintendo DS (Super Collapse 3) and loved it, it's just as fun on my phone (Optimus V).  Its a great time killer. :-)
__label__1 doesnt work on my galaxy tablet... does work great on my htc evo though.... fun, colorful and interactive.  my daughter loves it
__label__1 Can't figure out why I like this game a lot, but even after beating it I still end up playing it...  This coming from someone that doesn't really like timed games...
__label__1 You 1 star reviews with tablets are morons. It clearly says it won't work with tablets. Quit being haters &gt;:(
__label__0 Update: Newest update (April 2013) won't install. It downloads fine, but always comes up with the message: "App not installed."Other than that, it is quite good. Difficulty increases at a reasonable rate. costumes and backstory are kinda silly, but the g
__label__1 i finished the game and believe me it is a fun game. it took me a month to finish this game. it is a really easy game to play. PLEASE MAKE MORE AND MAKE THEM FREE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
__label__1 Ever since I first played Collapse on the computer I knew it would be the perfect puzzle game for touch screen gaming.  This was an obvious buy for me when I first got my Kindle Fire last year and so far I've really enjoyed it.Touch three or more of the 
__label__1 This game is beautiful and flawless as far as gameplay goes. Love it so far, especially the story mode. This game coincides with the Facebook and pc versions.
__label__0 This always has errors and dosent work very well. I dont know why but I have taken the app down from my computer. I will be removing it from my kindle as well.
__label__0 I understand it wasn't tablet friendly over a year ago, it should have been fixed by now. Especially with the tools provided to devs
__label__1 I am glad I don't have a tablet because then I would have missed out on this fun game.  This app was better than some of the computer versions I have seen.
__label__1 I read the dev's comments that this doesn't work on most tablets. So will moronic Xoom owners please stop scoring it with 1 star complaining that it doesn't work? That is very unfair on the developer.  I downloaded on my Evo, and consider it is an excell
__label__1 love the game, the storyline and graphics are also great. music too, i think its worth the cost. also good to get for free today :)
__label__1 I thought this would be Tetris-y, but thought I'd try it anyway. I am glad I did! There are lots of variations &amp; levels. It can be either relaxing or a challenge, depending on what you're in the mood for. Love it!  DROID X.
__label__1 Test device: Samsung EpicWow, where to start?  Ok, Collapse took your typical bubble/brick breaker game and went to town on it. Multiple game modes, special blocks, excellent graphics, well chosen sounds effects and background music, and controls that ar
__label__1 Very responisive and never lags, many game developers should take note from this guy/gal. Starts up quickly, fly by menus, and game is responsive.
__label__1 Great fun if you need something to do in order to clear your mind, relieve stress. Sat and played through several rounds, addictive.
__label__1 This is so much fun. I was hooked after the first game, and had to get it for all of my devices.
__label__1 So I picked this up when it was free and was done with the game 24 hours later. I could NOT put it down. Great game and fun as hell.
__label__1 Works fine on my Flytouch 3 Android 2.2 tablet. Give it a try. A great twist in a few old games. Well, I made the 25 words.
__label__1 This is a great game! Provides lots if entertainment and well worth the price, if you happen to miss the free app day.
__label__1 Great fun. This game is challenging and addictive. Quest was a little short though but taught you all of the modes of play. A buck is a great deal.
__label__1 When I got the collapse blast I thought I had died and gone to heaven.  About 2 days later I discovered the original Collapse and immediately purchased that too.  Now I can play either one any time the mood strikes me
__label__1 Worked well on my Pandigital Novel, Pandigital Planet and Samsung Tab 2.  I did not have any issues.  Very fun on all three.
__label__0 What the hell happened!!!! This game was great.  My wife would spend hours with this game and she does not even want to touch my g2x.  mmmm come to think of it, maybe this is the best thing since sliced bread since I like my phone so much.  Anyways, hope
__label__1 Very well made game. Devs did a great job on this one. I did not recieve the permissions some others have noted.
__label__1 I used to play this game on the computer, now I play it on my tablet. It is very addictive! I love it, and it keeps my senior brain alert!
__label__1 Cute fun game, works great on droidx. Ignore poor reviews this app requires far less permissions than 99% of the apps I've downloaded before. Plus it's fun!
__label__1 The free app of the day has been hit or miss lately but this one is a hit. Very entertaining and worth the buy if you miss it as a free app.
__label__1 june 10, 2011 update really screwed the game. viewable game screen is now 1/3 the size, menues are very choppy , graphics are worse. this game used to be very snappy and fun, now it is slow and tiny screen is killing my eyes and fingersEDIT6-14-11They fi
__label__0 i realy honestly hate it. the game itself blows monkey anus. plus u have to go on facebook. i dont have a facebook. serously i am not  even 7 freaking years old yet
__label__1 Takes advantage of a touch screen with simple but addictive game play.  I love playing this game and it was free
__label__1 I beat the game and enjoyed every minute of it. I would recommend this app to anyone looking to kill sometime on a trip.
__label__1 I like a good game that can work the ol' noggin, and this is a nice strategy game just for doing that.  It is challenging but it doesn't quickly turn into the same level over and over again (read: Tetris) but adds new different ways of playing (from clas
__label__1 This is a fun little game. It works great, is entertaining, and looks good.  I think this app is worth the cost.
__label__1 Love this game, play it all the time!! Even after I beat the game I start over cuz its always different puzzles
__label__1 Running the stock Android 2.2 from Viewsonic on my g tablet and this game works great. At first I thought this game was way too easy but it gets challenging after a while.
__label__1 amazing game to play, totally addicting. Can play the story mode or the quick game mode. Get this game! simple yet challenging, towards the last few levels it gets really hard
__label__1 this game. presents challenges and makes you work towards a goal. fun game to pass the time! plus it was free :)
__label__1 Quick game is fun for multipke generations. i loved the test drive online. may end up purchasing the PC game.
__label__1 I tried this game because it is free today. I'm glad I did. It's very fun and also challenging. I'm playing on my Vibrant and the graphics are clean and there is no lag at all.
__label__1 I thought I wouldn't like this game but it is well polished has a good sound track and very addictive game play. And I beat quest mode with all gold stars!!!
__label__0 On Xoom the buttons are in the wrong place and can't be clicked. On Nexus One the top quarter of the screen is empty. Sounds nice though.
__label__1 This is a great little time killer. It's a simple &quot;click on groups of 3 or more of the same color&quot; game, but with some little extras that make it funner than just the same old thing. You earn coins to buy power-ups, costumes for your character,
__label__0 I have this installed and working on my Nexus 7 and when I try to install the update it claims the game is not installed. So how did I install it and continue to use it but can't update it because it's not installed??????? Just doesn't make any sense.
__label__1 This has everything I enjoy in a game for the Kindle Fire - increasingly difficult as you move through the "quest", a variety of different puzzles including "panic attack."  Each step through the journey requires you to eliminate blocks of three or more 
__label__1 I also fell in love with this game on my sister's kindle. I needed to get it for myself. I am addicted. It one of those games that hooks you and you can't let go. Also one that frustrates you and gets your blood boiling.
__label__0 it is stuck at downloading. will not advance. should be a way to stop it and retry. have even restarted my tablet and nothing.
__label__1 Great game, glad I got it. Wish the levels where harder, the puzzles were difficult at time . Random words to make twenty words for review
__label__1 this is a very fun and addicting game. i love the quest mode. i couldnt put it down!! definitely download!!
__label__1 just beat the game today after playing it pretty casually since I downloaded it. really fun, challenging, and beautifully designed. great app.really hoping we get an update with more levels. it was a pretty quick game, but definitely worth getting.
__label__1 No problems installing.  Smooth gameplay - no lag or crashing. Disregard low ratings by tablet owners that didn't bother to read that this isn't for tablets.AMAZON - please setup a system that lets us vote down and/or hide spam or other useless or irrele
__label__1 Just as most every other review says: on my g2 this game runs flawlessly. Nice touch that it asks about sound on launch. The quest challenge adds a nice depth to the game that introduces variants on the classic game. High production value, good execution
__label__1 fun cute well made entertaining puzzle game with a quest mode and bosses.  just right for me. runs perfect on my mytouch4g
__label__1 I downloaded this game as the free app of the day, and got addicted to it within the first 10 minutes of playing it. It's like a more fun version of Tetris. The Quest mode isn't too long - just a few hours - but the single player is still a ton of fun an
__label__1 Very nice app. Especially in comparison to yesterdays crap shack. This one is awesome. Very addicting. I love it.............
__label__0 the map screen is now over sized and playing screen is to small. 1 star until fixed,  uninstalled - droid x gingerbread.
__label__1 This game is more than just your average bubble popping game or removing 3 or more alike pieces. It has fun challenging levels that keep getting harder as you go. I love the little trail that you can follow and the interactions you get along the way. dri
__label__0 This is yet another app that's version is far behind the same game, for the same price, on the Android Market. I believe the most recent version is supposed to be 1.7.1. Amazon needs to do something about the frequency of this problem.
__label__1 I have always been a fan of Collapse, and this really rocks to be able to play it right from my phone.  Love it!
__label__1 i love playing this.  my kids love it....so addicting.  its like a better than webkins cash cow.  cute app.  could be made harder though.
__label__1 I don't buy a lot of Apps. I have played this game on the computer and loved it, so when i saw it for Kindle I was thrilled.  A very fun and addictive game that has many modes. It works great on my Kindle Fire.
__label__1 I don't buy a lot of Apps. I have played this game on the computer and loved it years ago. it is great to have it as an app on my kindle fire. I can spend hours playing, When watching TV I play during the comericials.
__label__1 I love this game. So addictive and even when you finish the quest mode it is still fun to play.
__label__0 Unplayable after the latest update. Main menu had changed, graphics are missing, and play area has shrunk to an unplayable size. Hope this is fixed or will have to uninstall.
__label__1 this was my very favorite game and would still be but after playing the whole thing, i think, your board is just there. there is no congratulations you finished it all or do this or you missed this. kindle fire.
__label__1 Bubble buster is a great kissing cousin to this game.I'm using a my touch 4g, and I like pretty much everything about this game. Amazon have it away as a freebie, but I'd happy halt to pay 1.00 for it. They're some cool discoveries along the way. I finis
__label__1 i thought it would be no fun on a small screen,,, wow was i wrong !! i work with handi capper people and they get tickled when we play it !! God bless !!
__label__1 adds a fun little storyline to the old arcade and pc collapse game. still offers the timed and puzzle aspects but within a gradually unlocking walkthrough with collapse bosses that have different special abilities.  also has cute customizable outfits for
__label__1 This game is great. The quest is fun. I defeated the alien!!! That was the best and well though out level.The only negative thing is the icon doesn't have transparency.
__label__1 great games to keep your mind active and keep up to the pace of the fast acting puzzles. Lots of fun
__label__1 This is a great spin to the tetris / jewel genre. I've played many hours, and so have my young kids. The story line isn't that great, but difficulty goes up gradually and consistently, keeping this challenging for a long time
__label__0 update locked continuous! read on for other problems! don't know what the deal is but will change rating and review when fixed!
__label__0 why does a game need to read my identity? can't it just give me a game without knowing who I am? uninstalled. each app with such unjustified permission should be reviewed one star.
__label__1 Great gameplay, graphics, and story. Plenty of levels, each with unique challenges. A shining example of what a mobile game should provide. I don't get to say this enough: Well done!
__label__1 I got this thinking I was going to get a Columns clone, but I was wrong. This is far from your average bubble popper game. It starts off kinda slow, but when it picks up, its like no other popper game. I just had to tear myself away from it to make this 
__label__1 A game for those boring moments in life.  My favorite is quest mode.  I actually had this game on my last phone and liked it so much I downloaded it on my new one.
__label__1 I have a xoom.  Read all reviews.  Installed game anyway.  Am I stupid? I think not! Collapse works anyway.  I get a kick out of some of the people that are out there that complain so much about a little app.  I love the opportunity that Amazon gives peo
__label__1 downloaded for my 4 yr old, but i'm just as addicted as she is. highly recommended. its like bejeweled meets tetris in a weird way.
__label__0 It was teribble hated it. wasn't cool or anything.not cool.wow it was a dissapointment.wish I never installed.really really bad uninstalled
__label__0 Well first of all I found this thinking it was just a app that lets you listen to music, but, NOPE! You hear like 5 seconds of it and then it just stops if you don't want to be annoyed, then DON'T GET THIS APP!!
__label__0 For some reason, I couldn't listen to the whole song. The app would just play a minute or two of the songs! I'm just glad that I didn't waste any money on this.
__label__1 This is a wonderful app for global charts!  It isn't for listening to full length songs.  I am so happy I downloaded this app for my Kindle Fire HD!
__label__1 I always use this app for the cheapest hotel rates when I travel to see my husband who serves in the Marine Corps. It's quick, easy, and gives lots of different hotels in the area you want while comparing everything from price to which hotels have free b
__label__1 I like using this app because it makes it easy to search for hotels in one place. My husband and I like to randomly take a weekend away and this is a fast way for us to do so.
__label__1 I use this software for all my hotel stays. Sometimes I don't even have plans or a need to stay at a hotel, but I will goof around and see how cheaply I can get a room at a high rated hotel and I get such a good rate that I take little minnie vacations.
__label__1 I use this app all the time when i travel. Its really simple and user friendly and I have found many good, last minute deals while i was on trips
__label__0 Jame go back to star trek, you have a much brighter future in the stars. Why would I even down load an app like this. I never travel!
__label__1 It does save you money on travel ,like name your price on cars and hotels .Works  just like the web site,less ads
__label__1 This is a 'love it or hate it' kind of extreme mind-bender puzzle game and I suspect that not everybody is going to love it because these puzzles become VERY hard once you get past the first 3-4 screens. So, make sure you don't throw your precious phone 
__label__1 Great concept, and great execution. Plenty interesting and replayable but I still can't wait for shift 2. More, More, More...
__label__1 This game feels like Portal but 007 agent. An awesome original game that plays perfectly on my Moto Droid 3. However, if you are standing too close to a ledge trying to run/jump at the same time, jump will not engage resulting in an OOPS I Died. Takes a 
__label__1 plays great on asus transformer and droid x. fun puzzle game thats just challenging enough. love the music too. def worth paying for.
__label__0 Keeps force closing on my Motorola Atrix when I press play. Looks like it could be a fun game if I could actually play it.
__label__1 I absolutely love this game!  Just the right amount and combination of challenge and fun. Controls just take some getting used to. Incredibly engaging game - download now!Dev - please, please add more levels!
__label__1 I'm really enjoying this. I love puzzle games  and this one brings a whole new slant! Great fun. Droid X.
__label__0 I have a Droid 2, which I guess is what they call a multi-touch device? Sure doesn't seem like it to me because I died 50 times in Tutorial level 2 just trying to jump over the first gap in the game. Major design flaw, and I'm not the first to mention it
__label__1 Don't listen to the negative comments. This is byfar one of my favorite FAOTD thus far. Very unique concept, easy, responsive controls and tons of fun! Grab this one while it's still free.
__label__1 HTC Evo 4GThis is a quality game all the way. I love these avant-garde type puzzle/platformers and this one is no exception.
__label__1 Brilliant concept! it's a very fun time waster. I like that it gives that spy vs spy feel to it. Sometimes it glitches like for example when he falls it blinks and he's already at the bottom. Needs to run a little smoother. Also the jump button doesn't m
__label__1 Excellent game!! Challenging, fun and very well done. I really wish people would stop giving 1 star to games because it doesn't work on YOUR phone. Maybe YOUR phone just sucks.
__label__1 When Game Informer mag says a game is good, you should listen. I read a review on this game yesterday in the magazine, came to buy it today, and  BAM! Free app of the day! I have played about 2 hours and it amazing. Really fun, fresh approach. I would ha
__label__0 I love the flash version of Shift, so I was very dissapointed that it wouldnt even launch. Bummer. Samsung galaxy s vibrant.
__label__1 This puzzle game kept me busy for 1 1/2 hours. Very addictive. More than worth $2. Hopefully they will update with more levels.
__label__1 This game has supurb mind bending and lateral thinking puzzles. It is like the classic Prince of Persia games (yes, I just dated myself) were ported to Android with a super puzzle twist. Wel worth the money to get this game!!
__label__1 I have a 1.5 year old rooted X and it runs great.. Plus it's fun! If you have FC issues, blame your provider for putting bloatware on your phone, get a better phone or root it. Why pay for reduced capabilities? Thanks Dev, fun game, and thanks Amazon
__label__0 I played this on the PC and thoroughly enjoyed it. So when I saw it on the andoird I was excited.....but it force closes on the Droid X2 when first opened. =(
__label__1 This is a very fun game. just started playing it and really enjoy it. controls are excellent and easy to use with accurate and precise character movement.  Shift concept makes game even more challenging and interesting! Great app!!
__label__1 So its not the developers fault that amazon does not properly filter what games will work on your phone like the google market place, I've played this game on the PC and it deserves 5 stars. So for those that have a photon sorry but there are tegra games
__label__1 I found this game to be really good and well worth the time. The controls take a little getting used too, but don't take too long. Feels fine after practicing a bit. Graphics are simple and are perfect for the game. Just the same it should be. Developer 
__label__1 It'll probably take you a dozen or so stages to look at a board and really &quot;get it&quot;... but when you do it feels pretty natural. The game is a little short (I wanted more levels) , but has decent replay value... competing against the clock in a 
__label__0 when the force close issues are resolved this app will get a fair rating. it deserves 1 star from people if they can't get it running
__label__1 I LOVE this game. If you enjoy portal you'll love this game they are kinda similar. The fun of a platformer with the challenge of a puzzle. Oh and just so the trolls know I'm not the dev, im just a satisfied user.
__label__1 This is a great take on a performer game and one the best FAOTD games I've tried.  Very minimalist graphics - you fun your little guy across the platforms, with a button you can press to flip everything upside down, so you're high when you used to be low
__label__1 Shift Platformer Game by Handmark, Inc. is a super-exciting puzzle game!  I downloaded this game and was amazed at how addicting it is.I'm going to check out other games by Handmark, Inc as well.Download Shift Platformer Game today, and be sure to tell y
__label__1 Selecting options or play results in a force close. This was one of my favorite flash games, I look forward to playing it.
__label__1 great game! a little confusing at first but you catch right on. and to the person who waited &quot;months and months for this game to be FAOTD&quot; Why didn't you just spend the $1.99 and buy it?
__label__1 this game works great on my epic 4g 2.2its a bummer that so many people are having problems with the game because its actually prety cool and different (i thought it was gonna be another run and jump game, but i was wrong...sorta). its free today so why 
__label__0 Loved this game when it was browser-based. However, since there is no multi-touch support, it is impossible to run and jump at the same time. This makes the game 100% unplayable. Absolutely pointless to have ported it to Android since you can't play it w
__label__1 I have this on the kindle fire. I had no problems with it. this is one of the most creative games I've played and I love it. perfect for for the stratagist. I highly reccomend it.
__label__0 Why does this game need to know my location and to access the network through my phone? I thought the description says no ads. If there's no ads, then these permissions are not necessary. But yet they're still there.Buyer beware!
__label__1 Interesting game. The makers really thought outside the box in creating this one. I just wish it was bit easier on the eyes with higher resolution.
__label__0 Sloppy coding. Will not run on NI Adam tablet. Force close every time after opening screen. Tried several times after rebooting. No dice.
__label__1 Dinc2Controls work perfectly fine for me running stock rom. A clever game that I know I will play often. I would pay for this game hands down.
__label__1 great new idea loved it first time i played half huor whent by be bofore i knew it very fun a little challageing all around great
__label__1 This game is an awesome platform.  Works great on swagged OG EVO. I would recommend this to anyone who likes puzzle games
__label__0 The app immediately closes when I hit play. Tried the app 3-4 times, with the same result on the Tmobile G2x.
__label__1 interesting game, but over way too quick and very easy.  I would like to see more levels and an increased level of difficulty.  you should be able to get stuck and unable to complete a level if you make a wrong choice.  the puzzles need to be challenging
__label__1 I love this game, it has very innovative controls. after you get used to the controls you are good to go. the graphics are simple but they get the job done. the music goes well with the game, I don't know why the negative reviews. HTC sensation
__label__1 great game with smooth graphics, nice permissions, cool death animation, and small footprint.  great for my plane ride home today
__label__0 It always amuses me how some people put the blame on an app force closing on the PHONE.  If an app doesnt work on a major brand of a late model phone like the Droid x2, it is not the fault of the phone.  It disgusts me to see so many FAOTD apps have forc
__label__1 This game seemed kinda odd at first...After getting used to the Shift experience this game became 10x better well Worth the download!
__label__1 It is pretty simple with (again) simplistic graphics. Probably why it runs so solidly! Despite the "low" graphics I found this to be a lot of fun and challenging. I like challenging games that get me thinking. If you do to, pick this one up without hesit
__label__1 me being a dev I would never put an app on amazing ...this is a great app and people still hate on it. why do people hate here and not in the android market. this is so bull
__label__1 Great game, very fun, one star reviews deceptively lower this from five to four stars. It is in fact a five star game!
__label__1 awesome on motorola bionic! i was going to say controls were confusing, but after my 7-yr old explained it to me .... It was fun. simple graphics but challenging game play. well done.
__label__0 There is absolutely no reason to need to know where I am located in an ad-free game.  So like all the other privacy invading games, I will continue to 1-star them.Someone, please reply to this and give me one single GOOD reason for this dev to &quot;need
__label__0 The application will not open past the main menu, as several others have said. it sounds interesting but I cannot play it and therefore it does not deserve a good rating yet. G2x cm7
__label__1 good game. got it when it was faotd. so many 1 star reviews....don't pay any attention to them. this game works perfect in my Droid incredible with froyo.
__label__0 the game played well on my tablet...but my Droid 2 not so much. couldn't do the basic things in the game like jump. it was like the touch spot to jump was in a different spot than the graphic. that's if for my review,  couldn't play because of that.
__label__1 so awesome! sucks so many people are unable to run it, but it works great on my vortex. screw Flanders.
__label__1 this game is my go-to time killer.  the people who are obsessed with multi-touch are stupid.  There are four buttons: left arrow, right arrow, and two shift buttons flanking the top of the screen.  you jump by holding down the arrow of the direction you 
__label__0 Anytime I launch this application it force closes after selecting an option in the main menu. I am using a T-Mobile G2x
__label__0 Do not do not do not install this.  Reads phone identity for no good reason and i hot spam texts next day
__label__1 works great on Samsung Epic Touch. have to use your brain a bit. It's good to have a great phone. :-D
__label__1 Seems almost everyone complaining about fc has a motorola. Pathetic to criticise the app for a less than great phone. invest in a different phone. Great game.
__label__1 A nice original take on a platform game!  Begins easy,  ramps up difficulty pretty quickly and presents a formidable challenge that keeps you hooked and coming back to solve each level.  Definitely a thinking mans game here,  great job devs and thanks am
__label__1 A nice game to kill some time. it works perfectly and smoothly. Why some rate one star makes no sense. This is a simple game but even the simplest things are too complicated for some.
__label__1 Awesome!  Just an force closure bananza!  My little crappie phone just can't handle this wonderful force closing game. Wish more games would FC like this one!  Definitely a 5 star FCer.
__label__0 The controls for this game seem off on the eve. It's very hard just to navigate your character on the screen I would pass this on even for free
__label__1 The shift concept is a clever idea and adds interest and challenge in visualizing a plan to navigate each puzzle.
__label__1 Fun game. Works fine on a droid x - perhaps the whiners and low raters should get some hardware/software that is post 2009. I did notice most low reviews were not rating the actual game but technical issues instead.Could use more levels though.
__label__1 I thought the shift concept was creative, however; the action for the though screen controls seems to have the same sensitivity issue that most of these games do. Maybe that's supposed to be part of the challenge...IDK.  Anyway, worth it as the free app 
__label__1 cool premise and makes you think a little bit. the controls are good for mobile. worth a go for a bit.
__label__1 Works perfectly on rooted Droid X. Fun game, worth the download. Extra words Extra words Extra words Extra words Extra words
__label__1 I don't have a lot patience for games, but this one is pretty clever. I don't think I have ever played anything like it before. works great on evo 3d.
__label__1 I originally got shift lite from the android market and finished it up real quick. I'm glad it was the FAOTD today. it is definitely a fun puzzle game worth getting even of you don't know if you will be playing it immediately.there's not much else to say
__label__0 how sad this fc on my archos gen 8. was really looking forward to this as i love playing it on game sites
__label__1 works fine on my DROIDX, no crates with any buttons. the game is fun and unique. if you think Motorola sucks, go rate them low somewhere. this game is definitely worth the download.
__label__1 I have been waiting months and months for this game to come up as the FAOTD.  I played the lite version of this and fell in love with it.It's a very polished and well executed game.  The graphics are simple while still being stylish.  The gameplay concep
__label__1 This is a very unique game and I appreciate the fact that the developers offered it free today. Thank you very much.
__label__1 samsung Nexus S... a very challenging and unique puzzle game, very glad I picked it up despite the up and down reviews.Takes a bit of time to get the timing down on the multi touch controls but very smooth and simple graphics and really like the concept 
__label__0 As title says, doesn't work on my atrix. Too bad. I heard this was a good game. I'll review again if they fix.
__label__0 Jump function simply doesn't work on my G2.  Well, you CAN jump, just not in a controlled or practical way.  Can't even pass the second screen.
__label__1 love the game.. played it on addictingames a couple years ago and loved it. I have an impression 10 tablet and it ran perfectly. my only complaint is its kind or short, I wish it had some more challenging levels. maybe they will make a shift two.
__label__1 It takes bit to get a handle on the controls, but it's a pretty good game once you do. 20
__label__1 I love this game. It's lots of fun, simple design, controls work well, good animation. Would definitely recommend to friends.Only thing I don't like is the moving spikes. I feel like they make some levels nearly impossible. Personally I just like to take
__label__0 Game opens then force closes as soon as you hit play. Does not work on Motorola ATRIX. Good thing they tested before releasing.
__label__1 This is just what I've been looking for. A challenging puzzle game that's not like every other &quot;unblock me&quot; type of game. It's totally addictive and this is one game I will actually keep and play. Finally! The music does get a little old after 
__label__1 ... u'll like this too. they're not the same but it's clever like portal. very inventive, but I did finish it in one sitting. it would be great if more levels became available in the future (please!).
__label__0 just installed and it immediately force closes every time. no matter what option I choose from the main screen, still force close
__label__1 HA! Get a life whiners!  Worked perfect on my Moto Droid!Old Guys Rule!!!Fun game, I can see puttering with it when I'm on my &quot;two-minute&quot; break!  ;-)Moto Droid, S.S. 5.6, 1G-lv kernelhahahaha X2 hahaha Take that!
__label__1 Devices - Works great on Samsung Epic Touch (SGII) and Acer A500 TabletControls - Multi touch support on both devices work great.  Yes - it takes a little getting used to for the jump.  Yes I sometimes think it should have jumped and didn't.  But - once 
__label__1 I think this game could be my new favorite. It makes you think, is challenging and kinda funny at the same time
__label__1 ignoring them is best. This is a great original game. 5 stars anything less and people are being too picky, have cheap phones, or are trolls.But I digress, Amazon has let the review system go to poo.This is the direction Android games need to go. More cr
__label__1 really fun puzzle game, no problem with the controls at all. the jump and run being the same button is not an issue. definitely download and give it a shot.
__label__1 Really like the minimalist design and the nod or throw back to some of the old spy movies. You can get lost and engrossed in the task at hand, as the game is a nice mental challenge. If you're a puzzler, its definitely worthy of a place amongst your Brai
__label__1 Works great and lots of fun. I've always enjoyed the shift games and glad to get it free. Thanks Amazon
__label__1 EVO 3D... works fantastically! Pretty fun game. I find it easy to jump I guess some people are complaining just to complain.
__label__1 I played through a few screens and so far the game and controls respond well on my Moto Droid. It's different than most puzzle games that I've seen, so kudos for that. This seems like a good time passer so far and I will be keeping it on my phone for a b
__label__0 This game force closes on my Motorolla Atrix everytime after I hit the start button. Will reevalute after bugs are squashed.
__label__0 Crashes when I click play. Dev apparently didn't test enough. Disappointed. AT&amp;T Atrix 4g fully updated running android 2.3. Don't waste your time
__label__1 game is incredible! works perfect on hacksung fascinate cm7. moto users should buy a new *good* device. moto is crap and always has been
__label__0 Same problem as other Droid X2 users. Forces closes before it even starts. What a complete waste of memory space!
__label__1 With some of the FAOTD lately, I was afraid to try this one with no reviews, bit I thought, what the hell? This is a great puzzle game. My only complaint is not having a dedicated jump button.
__label__0 force close every time i press play. looks like a game i would enjoy. oh well. at least it was faod.
__label__1 sure the controls arent the greatest but it is still super fun to play. i like how they kept the levels true to the original game. thanks amazon for making this free today!
__label__1 First off, you have to know the controls. You can jump by touching the top right, but it appears people here don't know you can double jump by tapping a second time. Punching the appropriate debris is also important in this game, as there are jumps impos
__label__0 Do not install on LG Optimus. Made my phones memory full after it errored on installation. Had to use my comp to get it off.
__label__0 Seems to be a fun and simple game.  At least the first thirty seconds.  By then it will surely have crashed.
__label__0 The goal of a review is to communicate to potential buyers what they can expect from the product. Since Amazon's Appstore doesn't have a means of filtering based on phone compatibility like some other stores, it is up to those of us who have had a bad ex
__label__0 My specs: Samsung Gravity SMART (runs Froyo, low-midrange).While the protagonist must run, the game itself does not. It fails out of the gate when trying to install, with no indication at all what the problem is. The only "requirement" listed is Android 
__label__1 Dear Amazon, please remove all reviews wherein the reviewer complains about an app when their trash phone is to blame. Did they complain when they couldn't get Half-Life to run on their Commodore 64? Likely, yes.
__label__1 Fun, simple game. Good to pick up and kill a few minutes, don't expect some epic adventure. I downloaded this for ps3 a few months ago, because it was like $1. My three year old likes it too.
__label__0 okay. I'm glad that either you grumpy off-setters either have the newest phones or you can get one. for us in the real world who have a contract and have the same phone until it's out, we do have the right to rate it as we please.I love my Optimus S...th
__label__1 Game is fun but needs some better controls added like pausing and going back to the menu. Instead it automatically restarts every time you die. Didn't take off a star because I liked the game enough anyway. Hopefully those improvements come!
__label__0 It wont install on Lg so I can't rate it properly. I'm just hoping I save someone else the trouble.
__label__0 game freezes. graphics are bad. not a very good game. has a lot of problems. needs fixed. word word word word
__label__0 just like many other run and jump games out there this game is no better then ones u can get free already. graphics are Ahh nothing great.Force closes...and controls suck they don't work!!!I my self find the game boring after a minute and being that ever
__label__1 While I Must Run! uses the hit game Canabalt's formula of run and jump, it adds sliding and punching into the equation as well. I Must Run! is a great game with cool environments and great gameplay.
__label__0 The game looks like a good game. This app. does not install on the L.G  phone. Tried it twi ce and still would not install.
__label__1 Graphically this game looks horrible but for what it is, it is fun. Simple easy to play and had some replay value.
__label__0 That's true, the Optimus V can't run fast scrolling games like &quot;Yoo Ninja&quot; and &quot;Ninja Rush.&quot; Oh wait, it CAN. In fact, it runs nearly everything from &quot;Angry Birds&quot; to &quot;Netflix&quot; if one has Android 2.3 installed. I g
__label__0 Does not install in the LG Optimus.  One star because no where does it say that it will not work on my crappy phone or list phone requirements.  The game sounds like it would suck anyways.
__label__0 This may be an excellent game but unless the author makes an effort to cover most popular devices it will not receive the best reviews. Try again!
__label__0 Not much fun since it locks up on the HTC Thunderbolt after a few rounds. Very little difference from that running ninja game. No storyline.
__label__1 for starters it doesn't ask your permission to access 10 things on your phone like other games, just 1 permission request to install.The game is very simple, jump when needed, punch when needed, and slide when needed to get to the end of the game a save 
__label__0 this game is a blatant ripoff of of a free flash game. the art has been changed, but the creator of this app is soulless for charging for a game that someone far more creative already made.
__label__1 This is a super fun game and its addicting. And it is a lot of fun on your kindle fire. Just because other people don't like it doesnt mean you wont like it.
__label__0 not worth the money there is no point and is a waist of device space I bated this app stupid
__label__0 I have to say never waste your money on this game!!!! Dont just dont buy this ever.Promise me you wont waste money on this.
__label__0 I hate this app it is totally gross and when I deleted it the first time it installed itself again!!!! I deleted it several times w/o even re-installing it. This is a terrible app and I am very irritated.
__label__1 Alright everyone, hasn't anyone told you that if you don't have anything nice to say, don't say nothing at all? Well, you should take that advice and stop writing harsh reviews! I get how you are helping people out but you don't have to be mean! This is 
__label__0 when will people learn . they need to listen to their customers.  I totally agree with 1 and 2 it even looks gross.  who finds fun not pain in popping zits. if you do your not right
__label__1 My daughter love to play this game of pimple popper. When I look at her to playing and I said ewww!! LOL
__label__0 A pimple popping game? Can you spell GROSS? This app sounds like it's made for insecure teens with acne. Does this app sound intreaging to you? I hope not.Let me tell you something. THE APP DOESN'T WORK. I've installed it and uninstalled it and reinstall
__label__0 wow. pop pimples its fun! not. I mean go pop your own pimples c'mon people how could you ever think this is fun? it is majorly gross to!! who wants to sit there and pop pimples on a stupid game??? sigh
__label__0 I buy it, I thought it would be great, but it isin 't. Im sitting here trying to pop a pimple and im thinking :  THEGAMESUCKSIWANTMYMONEYBACK!!!!! I mean don't  buy it it's a waste of money and a waste of time. WORTHLESS!
__label__1 first off I'm guessing this game is like the seasons one,  so if it is ( which I really think so)  then it is AAAAWWWWSSSSOOOOMMMMEEEE!!!!
__label__0 I haven't even bought this game and I'm grossed out I mean look at the pictures there is pus coming out of a pimple!  How can people play that game?
__label__1 Maybe it's the nurse in me , but I love this . Anything that has to do with the removing of or cleaning around ,reminds me of nursing days.We didn't pop pimples , but ,got to break a boil on a patient for a Dr. Never  forget that .
__label__1 I've had it for a few months and have cashed out about $15 in Amazon giftcards. It's not complicated, you can download apps, sign up for spam and trials, watch videos, make phone calls and more for credit. Very simple and they do pay, it's great!
__label__0 I didn't like this app. It seems like you have to pay for all the offers to get anything back.
__label__1 Great app lets me get amazing gift cards! If you want 0.25&cent; here's my invite code: CM2065859 Your welcome get the app!
__label__0 The app will not let me sign in despite already having an account. It just loads and returns me to the Sign Up/Sign In page.
__label__0 Most of the things that it makes you do cost money. So basically, you are going to spend around ten dollars for 50 cents. Does that sound very fair to you? Not Me!
__label__1 I really enjoyed playing this game. at times for several hours. if you are feeling like playing roulette than its time to play this one.
__label__1 Brings back memories of playing in the casino's. This is a fun game that I'm sure will give me hours of enjoyment! Don't forget to log-in everyday so your &#34;Bankroll&#34; will continue to increase. It gets bigger and bigger every day you log in and pl
__label__0 It was a complete time waster. Didn't play like I wanted and it was complete crap. I deleted it immediately. It was really boring.
__label__1 I really like this game.  It is easy to play and I only wish I could download it on Facebook and my android cell phone.
__label__0 Screens look fun. Attempting to install on Optimus V causes forced reboot. Will revisit and review when issue is resolved.
__label__0 will not install on lg optimus v.  crashes phone &amp; causes reboot.  as usual, amazon appstore won&apos;t let you delete
__label__1 Runs fine on HTC Incredible.  Unique game, you tap the screen to send your character into orbit around various planets while avoiding enemies and obstacles.  Is it me, or do Optimus V phones have a lot of problems? Glad I didn&apos;t get that phone.
__label__0 Reboots the phone during installation. Would like to know how to get rid of the install app since it doesnt work. - phone: LG Optimus V.
__label__1 love this game, though it does lock up sometimes when loading between screens.... and now I need seven more words
__label__1 I never had a problem with freezing but the app did have bad ads, especially for kids. They fixed that and the game runs great and is a lot of fun! The bunny does turn silver when he has a hat on though. Thanks guys!
__label__1 fun game that has provided solid entertainment.  not sure what errors others are having - runs smooth on HTC incredible.  I definitely recommend it.
__label__1 I got this app on the android market months ago. wonderful game, fun and addictive. no prob with freezing. wish they had a paid version to remove ads. one of the best games on android.
__label__0 Freezes at the end of every level. For the person that said you can&apos;t rate it if you haven&apos;t played it. If it freezes the it sucks. Fix the bug and ill change my rating.
__label__0 Same problem others are having with LG Optimus, no matter the letter designation. Tried to install, hard reboots phone. So disapointed! Please fix!!
__label__1 this is a AWESOME app. its really fun and entertaining. its also very time consuming. GET THIS APP!!!!!!!HE HEHEHEHEHEHEHE hehehehehehe
__label__1 This is a really fun game. It does freeze up once in a while, but the price is right. It has adds but they keep them out of the way.If they iron out the bugs this could be up there with angry birds. Good job.
__label__1 The gameplay is good, it leans a bit toward the easy side though. Generally can 3 star after only a few atempts. Where this game shines is in it&apos;s spectacular production quality. The graphics are nice, without pushing the hardware too much. I dont t
__label__1 To begin with, probably 99% of the low ratings are due to non-compatibility. I think there should be another way to mark phones not compatible other than giving it a 1 star rating. That just does not properly show how good an app/game actually is. Now on
__label__0 I was really looking forward to trying out this application however when I tried to install it it just restarted my phone every time that&apos;s really too bad lg optimus v
__label__1 I downloaded this on our Vegan-tab G-Tab and my 4 (almost 5) year old loves it. He&apos;s been playing it over and over again. Plus, it&apos;s free.
__label__1 best game. better than ANGRY BIRDS. ANGRY BIRDS!!!! I love that people created the game listen to me no one else!!
__label__1 Bright graphics, quick loading, and actually requires some intelligence to play the higher levels. We need lots more like this one...
__label__0 This app makes my phone crash every time I try to install it. It looks like a game I&apos;d like, so I&apos;m pretty disappointed.
__label__1 Just like a few others the game reboots my phone during install.  It&apos;s too bad because this looks like the best rabbit space sim I would&apos;ve ever played.
__label__1 Entertaining little game. Very reminiscent of Super Mario Galaxy, which is a good thing. Fun, somewhat challenging. Has run on my Htc Thunderbolt with no problems. Highly recommended.
__label__1 runs smooth on my samsung captivate. no freezing or rebooting like others are complaining about. this is a fun game with nice smooth graphics.
__label__0 every time I tried to install my phone would shut down. It never did install. I don't get it. Not good
__label__1 this game is awesome! I&apos;ve played through a lot of the levels. they get pretty challenging. haven&apos;t had any crashing or downloading problems on my Droid or Thunderbolt.
__label__1 I HAVE HAD DOCTORS AND ALL KIND OF EDUCATED PEOPLE TRY THEIR LUCK ON THE SAMPLE TEST AND THIS SEEMS HARD FOR NEARLY EVERYONE. IT DOES MAKE ONE STOP AND THINK TO REASON OUT IF YOU CAN THE ANSWER. I LIKE THAT IT DOES GIVE THE REASON AND EXPLAINS THE ANSWER
__label__0 This game wouldn't download.  O believe I tried twice and gave up.  I would like to try again on the future to at least Der what it was like
__label__1 Great Game, can be very changelling, but just what I wanted.  If you love a challenge, this is the game for you.
__label__1 There are so many ways to improve your mind with this device. Topics are: analogy, blood relationships, classification, coding/decoding, direction sense, logical reasoning, mathematical operations, number/ranking/sequence, series, statements/conclusions/
__label__1 You better be prepared when you play this &#34;game&#34;.  It is EXTREMELY challenging and very intense.  Intriguing questions in every area of knowledge.  You have to exercise ALL of your brain power to figure some of the questions!!  A real mental work
__label__1 This is a fantastic app to retrain ur brain....occasionally hangs up but I'm yet to find an app that doesn't...nothing to get annoyed about. Really great exercises for the brain!
__label__0 Damn thing went to my cloud when I was reviewing it and then just started d/l. Took 107 of my coins. I deleted it !! Did not want it to begin with. Beware of this with this app.
__label__1 So much to this app. So many questions and sections. It just keeps going and going. Love the challange of it!
__label__0 Too complicated for me. Was hoping to find something more relaxing and easier to do. Will have to try more of crosswords type. Will keep looking.
__label__0 thought that it was for the kindledidnt payattentionfirst app I got when I first bought the kindlesure its a good game just not for the kindle
__label__1 I don't know how many total games are within the game, but 3 generations of us love to play them, trying to get the best score!  Only problem, grandkids have the higher scores I'll never be able to match.  Very good for membory challenges, hand-eye coord
__label__1 Fantastic test.  Always wanted to know my IQ.  I was surprised as to how high it was. You will like it.
__label__0 I think this was made by a kid so good job. If this was made by a adult you need help. Minus it is a another tower defense game it just horrible graphics it looks like junk. The dev needs to refund 10 mins of my life back.
__label__1 It's a fun easy to understand game. Simple to play especially for anyone who hasn't played tower defence type games before. I've played lots and this is in my top 5.
__label__1 This game works well on tmobile g2.  This game is not as well polished as other tower defense games but the swamp concept is great,  plus the objective is a little different than other TD games.  You only need to pass a certain number of waves in order t
__label__1 I've been playing the lite version for a few weeks now and this game is lots of fun. Easy enough to leant and play, challenging enough to not get boring fast. Evo 4G
__label__1 I play alot of tower defense games, and this isn't remotely as bad as some are making it sound. Yes there are bugs but all &amp;  all fairly entertaining.
__label__0 I don't even have to play the game to notice the blatant display of cleavage in the sample images.  I personally find that very tacky.  I noticed the fun cartoon monster and just about downloaded this app.  I'm glad I took the time to notice what was goi
__label__1 ... cleavage? Like their kids aren't going to see that at Walmart or your local supermarket! Anyway, yes, another tower defense game but, I freaking LOVE the music! LOL! Gives you that down home on the farm feeling, and that's from someone born and raise
__label__0 only works for about 20 seconds and then freezes. you can wait 10 minutes and it'll unfreeze for another 10 seconds, or you can let ot crash your phone.don't pay for it... don't even install it for free
__label__0 I love tower defense games, even crappy ones. This one won't install on my phone, however, so it gets one star. On LG Optimus S, and I made sure I have enough memory available before downloading.
__label__0 The graphics lackluster, the cost of weaponry is unbalanced. The levels are very very basic. There are alt of tower defense games out there which is a great thing. But this particular game brings nothing special to the genre. Go for tower defense hd or p
__label__1 people are dumb.  complaining about cleavage? that's just bad parenting. don't let your child ever leave a room if you don't want him seeing that.  good game its free can't complain
__label__1 I'm addicted!!! This game is a lot of fun and easy to play. It's not always easy to win though! I need SDAA! Lol
__label__1 I didn't like the game, but still going to give it 5 stars because it IS another TD game. good graphics, music, meh, but overall, enjoyable. All you 1 star haters out there, don't rate it poorly just because you don't like the game. uninstall it,  and ST
__label__0 First off there is no tutorial. There are also balance problems with the enemies. Finally, when I exit the game it doesn't save my progress, so I have to start over.This game was not ready for release.
__label__1 This is the first android game that didn't bore me after 5 minutes.The music is silly but added to the game.I love the undocumented tower powerups. It makes the game interesting.  It actually encouraged me to use creative placement strategies instead of 
__label__1 Great game with a light Ui. It is a bit tacky at times but fun. Not a whole lot of out of the box thinking. Still very enjoyable. And for the mother arguing about the cleavage debacle, try taking your kids to the mall without seeing some girl with a fake
__label__0 REALLY?  CAN ANYONE BE ORIGINAL ANYMORE?  HOW MANY OF THESE STUPID GAMES WILL THERE BE?  PLUS THIS ONE SUCKS. This has to be one of the worse.
__label__0 No tutorial, no explanation of which units do what. Game crashed on my G2x before I could finish the first level.No story to go with the game. Very unbalanced when it comes to the attackers hit points vs tower strength.Save your dollar and find a differe
__label__1 This is a tower defense game with some interesting variations.  First is the theme; your units are some sort of rednecks with different attacks, and the enemies are swamp creatures.  There are several levels, which have a path for the enemies (they come 
__label__1 this is the first time I play a defense kind of game, I really enjoyed it. keep the free app coming amazon!
__label__0 Pretty sure Ive seen this EXACT game before but with Aliens or other stupid craps. Bad graphics, poorly made, not fun. Hurray for free.
__label__0 Seriously, how many more tower defense games are people going to make?  Nothing impressive, special, or worthwhile of this one.
__label__1 Tower defense is such a broad category that it has its own genres. Vector for the purists. Single tower. Turn based. Battle. Open field. Long path. Short path. Military. Cartoonic.This is cartoonic and short path. Its also just plain silly. it falls in t
__label__1 This is an absolutely solid tower defense type game that doesn't take itself too seriously, which makes it so much fun to play. All you need to know is in the 'family' info and everything else is self-explanatory; if you need more - i.e., a full-fledged 
__label__1 I remember when this released on Xbox Live Indy Games for a dollar some months ago. I actually considered spending a dollar on it at the time, but now it looks like I don't have to! The game is simple and moderately entertaining, something you can easily
__label__0 Whooooo. . . . another tower defense game for mobile phones. It's not like there aren't already a thousand tower defense games out there already. It's not even worth a quarter. Your dollar would be better spent on the dollar menu at McDonald's, the dolla
__label__0 It won't even install on my phone. Something about the package. Total bullcrap. This should be taken off the market.
__label__1 rating this 5 stars to counter act the same idiots that put 1 star reviews for every faotd. if you want an unbiased review go check the android app store. most of the reviews over there are 5 star, so pay no attention to the stupid babies that rate ever 
__label__1 I love this game so much that I play it EVERYDAY!!!! It is fun fun fun! There is nothing else that I love more.
__label__1 I want this game but you cant buy on the kindle fire.. it sorta sad. if they made this for the fire id love it! thanks
__label__1 only wish is that it would let you set sequences of colors for the marbles given as the ammo. Some orders might be impossible though but downloading a sequence to help make it easier could be a big help. The sequences for levels could be rated too as eas
__label__1 I totally love this specially since its free. I made a giant flower one time played it for 10 minutes straight AWESOME!!!!!!!
__label__0 I found this app, I thought would be.cool but I guessed wrong.. this app said it does not work on kindle fire, but it worked but it was sooooooo confusing! I hate bubble baster and this is just worse!
__label__1 It is the one game I play for relaxation and it is easy for the grand kids to play without much trouble.
__label__1 i have bubble buster and i guess everyone has bought it because the levels are way diffrent than they used to be.i'm not saying i dont like it i was just warning the people who have bubble buster that their levels look diffrent. i love bubble buster leve
__label__1 this game is one of my faves! it keeps me entertained and other people too! really like to relax and play when I have time!
__label__0 I first looked at it.then I played the normal version,and it looked totally different then when I first got it!then I buy this one,and try it out,and don't watch the freaking tutorial,and HOW DO YOU SAVE THE CREATION OR JUST PLAY WITH IT!!!!!!!!Someone p
__label__1 You can make anything you want to, even vases! At first,it was kind of tricky. Later, I had 20 levels! But then,my brother deleted most of them. LOL!
__label__1 level 787 is nearly impossible.  while it does take skill, you need even more luck. took me 2 weeks to get close to passing this level, now I'm burned out. I'm uninstalling now
__label__1 This app is great. It is a lot of fun to make your own levels. That is really cool. I highly recommend getting this app.
__label__1 easy to play, fun, and never a problem loading. it's not overly exiting, but a great quick game to waste short time periods with. i highly recomend this for someone collecting fun FREE games.
__label__1 This is a fun game and I highly recommend it.  My grandchildren think this game is the best ever.  You will love it
__label__1 i do not get it even with the tutorial i think they should give it better instructions but it seems fun!!
__label__1 I have tried many, if not all, the "Bust-A-Move" type match 3 bubble busting type games. I believe this one is the best of them.It starts out with the basic "Bubble Buster" game and after it will "upgrade"to the "Bubble Buster Level Editor." With the lev
__label__1 this is my favorite apps of all the ones I have got from amazon apps store. If you don't like most violent games this will fit like a ring.
__label__1 this was a great addition to the regular game that allows you to create your own level. made for hours more fun than the regular game gives
__label__1 my sister asks me if she can play bubble buster level editor and I say no I am playing on it
__label__1 although the reterded shooter steers like a train, i love editing.  :)  besides. i got a buddy who can fix it for these guys. buy it!!!!
__label__0 This app is a waist of time I could make a better app blindfolded. How do you work it seriously. I HAD IT FOR 10 SECONDS AND GOT CONFUSED. I read your tortural NO HELP!!!!!!!
__label__0 the game is woo confusing it keppes showing up ads and covering up part of muly screen the cool dude says nah not cool not rad nor wicked not anything but bad totalyy not worth the chilllaaaxxxx for
__label__1 I Love This App. When I am Board I play this game. Love, Love, Love this app. I think you should her this app.
__label__0 I hate the fact that they do not offer home service. I thought the whole idea of wifi was to have service everywhere. I didn't like that at all!
__label__0 This app doesn't work at all wheter at my home or at my work, and when you try to cancel subscription in next to impossible.I wounldn't recommend this app to anyone.
__label__1 I tried this app with much trepidation after reading all of the other reviews, but I haven't had any problems with Boingo freezing up or causing any problems. I have really enjoyed using this app. It fires right up and find wifi without issue, logs me ri
__label__0 Not sure what this app does. It does not help find the hot spots just seems to sell you internet services that I do not know where they are. I took it off my kindle.
__label__0 It is not as advertise, it cannot find you a wireless connection, it only found connection if I was home and of course that was the connection I already used.  It could not find a connection when ( was out and about which is what I need.
__label__0 This will totally screw up your kindle.  Constant rebooting and shutting down in tyhe middle of searchers. It reallly sucks.
__label__0 I actually think I paid money for this app, and ended up deleting it because it was useless. It didn't help me at all.
__label__0 So Dumb, supposed to help you find free wi-fi, basically it shows the ones that I know are free, like starbucks, panera, Mcdonalds, my phone does it for me with out paying a fee each month. Please don't waste your money.
__label__1 I use this app to get free wifi if possible on my Amazon Kindle Fire. If I am offline Boingo does it automatically and presto I am online with wifi! This app is not for tethering, it is to locate wifi.
__label__0 NOT GOOD IF U DON'T TRAVEL OUT OF STATE....I GUESS IF U WERE IN A DIFFERENT PLACE ALL THE TIME IT WOULD BE GOOD  TO FIND HOT SPOTS...BUT NOT 4 ME ...AT $9.95 4 ME IS A WASTE

__label__1 My kindle notifies me when new comics are available, there is a large selection, and it's simple to use. There isn't much more to say than that. I like this program. It's one of the best that I've found.
__label__1 This is a great app that helps me keep up with the books coming out, but also what my favorite writers and artists are up to.
__label__1 i don't have to go to the comic book store anymore. all i have to do is use this app to see if its even worth driving over there. this app is super helpful and easy to use. thanks audacious software!!!
__label__1 If you are a fan of comics, this is an essential app. Wednesday is indeed the best day of the week :)  I am really into the Red Lanterns series by DC (the new 52), among others.
__label__1 Magnificent!!! I enjoy comics.I can read them anytime I want to.Anybody who doesn't like Fresh Comics probably don't like to read.

__label__1 I just wanted to be able to see what apps are still running in the background, on my Kindle Fire, after I move on to something else.  This one does just that.  It tells me what's running and how much RAM it is using.  Also gives me the option to shut dow
__label__1 really is helpful....keeps you in touch with what apps are still open, even when you think you have closed them.
__label__1 I know it does more than I ask of it but really never spent much time exploring to see what else there is. Don't use my Kindle that much so I don't charge it much. At least with this app, I can see what is running in the background that might use resourc
__label__1 I have this on my phone, it's a real battery saver. I have some apps that will not close no matter how you exit them...this app did them off so they aren't ruining in the background running down my battery.

__label__0 This game has really bad controls but you still win, it also has really bad graphics so don't even bother downloading the light version you will only be losing valuable time in your life!!!!

__label__0 This is a stupid ap.  in the beginning you have to beat this girl AND SHE CHEATS!!!!!! one minute she'll have ten points then BOOM 21 points.
__label__0 I like the game, it just isn't very fair to control. I always get irritated when it misplaces my roll on the bowling ball.
__label__0 the graphics suck and the ball is very hard to throw.the game doesn't refer to bowling at all.I beat this game in 10 minutes.
__label__0 this game is really dumb! its not realistic at all! I don't ever play it because its so boring and its not even fun!
__label__1 I got this for my kids to play on my kindle but have found myself playing it more than them. Its a free app so doesn't cost you anything so defiantly worth the download

__label__0 Perhaps a one is a bit harsh considering I have a three year old.  The graphics are great.  The play is ... is there play?  It is hard to imagine this being engaging on any level, even for the youngest of kiddos.  It seems mostly like eye-candy that gets

__label__1 I've heard so many great things about this keyboard, mainly as it pertains to tablets. Being I don't have a tablet I've always passed this keyboard up. What a mistake! This keyboard is extremely polished and completely customizable. You can choose betwee

__label__1 thank you amazon for making this available, i had read about this keyboard layout awhile back. it is an actual joy to use my phone. i must have 60 wpm in landscape. all phones and tablets should have this as an option if not native.
__label__1 Lots of themes to choose from save money you from hassling with metamorph. It's responsive, and customizable and VERY easy to use.
__label__1 Purchased this for my Asus transformer and it works like a dream. I even like the autocorrect better than the stock keyboard. I agree with the other posters that this should be standard for all tablets, particularly the 10&quot; ones. a definite buy!

__label__1 i love this keyboard i have been using mostly swype but decided to try this one out. this keyboard app has tons of customization  options its very spacious  to type with its well worth the price tag and  a fantastic deal for the faotd.. download it now!
__label__1 I have been using this keyboard for more than two years. No other keyboard offers customization as this keyboard does.
__label__1 I use this keyboard on all my Android devices. it's one of the first apps I load on any new Android devices. I love the the unlimited customization options to fit my needs and personality.
__label__1 I was looking for a keyboard that was compact and also had arrow keys to navigate with. this keyboard has that. it also makes it very easy to access numeric keys, symbols,etc. i highly recommend it!
__label__1 I so love this keyboard app. From not having to switch between keyboards to the split keys, this is the best keyboard app! I love being able to long hold a key to get another letter, and having backspace keys.  There are so many options to be able to per
__label__1 This is, hands down, the best keyboard one can have or use on a tablet. Well worth the purchase price if you use your tablet much at all.
__label__1 The title says it all.  I'm a sucker for customization, and this keyboard has it all and more.  Absolutely great, all five stars for you!
__label__1 I got this for my tablet and this is THE keyboard app for tablets. It's so sleek and the interface is so effective. You can even switch modes back and forth immediately. I have Swift Key on my phone and I might switch to Thumb keyboard but I know that th
__label__1 This is by far my favorite keyboard. I'm running a rooted Evolution 4G on Synergy and it has a different keyboard than stock that doesn't have direction arrows. This keyboard was the only one I found with the arrows. It does so much more then that though
__label__1 Even If you don't need the split function for two thumb operation, this is a fantastic upgrade from the built in Android keyboard.  It has so many different settings, including a full unsplit version, and multiple oolors of keyboards. At first I didn't l
__label__1 When I first activated it my phone's touch screen became unresponsive.  After a reboot all was good, and I love the keyboard.
__label__1 Not long after I was somewhat disappointed with the last free keyboard (Swiftkey X), I bought Thumb Keyboard. I like this app - but danged if I didn't pay full price for it!That's OK, the dev deserves it!
__label__1 Absolutely the best keyboard i have ever used. There are a ton of customization options and skins. Great Buy. Keep up the good work!
__label__1 I got this for my Nook Color 7" tablet, but I liked it so much I put it on my phone too.The standout feature is the programmable shortcut keys. It's really helpful for often used phrases, or long email addresses.There's tons of customization, so if you d
__label__1 Thumb Keyboard allowed me to type notes for several hours a day, for 3 days, during a convention.  The split keyboard permitted me to type in a position that took the strain off my hands, wrists, and arms, and I had no cramping, aches, or pains at all.  
__label__0 i look up this app so i can get it 4 my niece and it costs MONEY now this is a outrage its basically a preschool play set how ridiculous  STUPID APP CREATOR
__label__1 Please update this app...it has not been updated since JULY......AND IT GLITCHES FROM TIME TO TIME. Thank you. It is a nice game though.
__label__0 I got this app for FREE a couple weeks ago and I was checking for and update at the store and I saw this for 2.99!!!!!!! this is SO messed up!!!!! don't buy cuz its a rip off!!!!!!!!!!!
__label__0 I down loaded this app for free in May or June for my toddler and he loved it.  However, my Kindle had to be replaced a week ago.  When I linked the new one to my account,  the app was just gone.  It had also diappeardd off my husband's Kindle.  It was a
__label__0 This app is bad. When I used it, it said I had 381 friends on facebook. But when I went on my facebook page, it said I had 581 friends. This app is WRONG and NOT UPDATED . Do NOT get this.
__label__1 This app has let me know who has left my friends list as well as keeping track of special dates for friends.
__label__0 Not sure how it shows you were unfriended by someone 1 day and can't get into their profile and then the next day you are friends again without a friends request.  something is fishy to me.  it was fun to see who unfriended me, but to find the next day w

__label__1 My husband and I both really like Marc Maron's format for WTF -  interesting guests, some tidbits from his life, good observational humor that's a touch dark sometimes. It's great. The Ben Sidran interview is one of the best ones on here - check it out.
__label__1 Marc's podcast is amazing, the interviews are fantastic.  This app is a great way to dive into his backlog of 400+ episodes.
__label__1 If you're considering this, you know Marc's show [if not go wtfpod.com...you'll hear in the show opening "he's not for everybody" TOO TRUE!]I've had none of the issues other reviews complain of, and I have to assume the problems are due to their devices,
__label__0 Waste of my time and energy to download! If you are looking for a personal finance organizer skip by this. Budget didn't calculate correctly, can only enter repeating income such as salaries and that is all this app even does if it is working.
__label__0 I don't understand it and can't get it to work.  It says &quot;accessing bills&quot; forever.  I put in one bill and it showed it due every day.  I had to shut down my kindle to make it stop.  I cant seem to find any directions and I hate the date format
__label__1 This is great for helping me to keep track of all my bills and when I need to pay them.
__label__1 I really like this app.  it helps keep me on target with my bills.  it gives me a reminder when to pay them.  I really recommend you download.
__label__1 I will use this as  long as possible.  Easy to use with no confusion.  Very helpful in keeping track of all my financial information.
__label__0 This is one of the most terrible apps I have downloaded on my kindle fire, I was not impressed at all. It is too hard to input everything
__label__1 I love this little ap. It keeps me on track with paying my bills and I'm able to budget accordingly.
__label__1 I highly recommend this app. It is very convenient for keeping track of your debits, there are other uses, however that is what I should it for and find it very helpful. Very much like a checkbook ledger. Cool app.
__label__1 I have a couple of tablets with only front facing cameras.  This means you have to go through some gymnastics to see both the code and what is being seen on the camera. What makes this one a good program for reading QR codes is that it automatically read
__label__1 This app functions well. The gui is functionally designed. You can scan, create, and share QR codes. What more could you ask for?
__label__1 I have enjoyed the ease of using this app and it has been lots of fun recording the things that I am searching for and keeping them handy...such as for my house search. I can keep them organized and find them on the maps easily. It makes the chore easier
__label__0 so this is a great all but for some stupid reason I get updates from Google Play AND Amazon's store. At least Google updates it automatically but the next day Amazon whines that it wants to update as well.  It is the ONLY app I have that does this and th
__label__1 Great tool. Not sure why it didn't come automatically with my phone. QR stands for quick response codes. You see these codes everywhere now. On water bottles. On store shelves. clothing tags. Toothpaste tubes. These codes can be handy. You can scan a cod
__label__1 Works very well and I use it all the time. It is an awesome way to retrieve  useful information.  Very good app. I would download again.  Thanks!
__label__1 I didn't think that I used this so I uninstalled it.  Discovered that I needed it for the PBS Wishing book scanner app, so it's back!
__label__0 While the scanner did work, it did not work intuitively, and it gave me too many warnings about things like being too close to the code. It also felt awkward to me to press the button (which I felt I had to do in order to get it to scan ... either that o
__label__1 No problems, reads multiple types of codes just fine with handy Internet links built into the program.  It's simple enough anyone should be able to use it.
__label__1 I haven't had this long, but it does what it says and so far no problems. Very easy to use.
__label__1 Easy to scan, simple to use, can even scan from pictures already taken. I don't use it often, but it's great to have the ability. I see more and more codes coming around each day, so it provides easy shortcuts to links and media. Great app!
__label__1 I like the app, it loaded quickly and that could be because my phone is Droid, and it scanned perfectly and I accessed the site without a problem.
__label__1 ...barcode reader for Android. It functions perfectly on my Toshiba Thrive. I have not yet tried making a QR code but I do not doubt it will work.
__label__1 I keep having emails, magazines, books, stores, etc that expected me to have this and now I do so I will be ready next time
__label__1 Nabbed this little puppy in my quest 2 get more information about certain products that were on offer to meit's quick simple to use and very informative when it provides the results
__label__1 i like it. so far it has worked, tho, because of limitations on my phone, I'm not always able to go to the webpage it points to, but that is no fault of the program.
__label__1 If you are a business owner, or are starting your own business, you can create your own QR code. It also will scan an existing code and tell you what is offered in it.
__label__1 This app was recommended to me by a friend, and it works perfectly every time!  So easy to use, as you just line up the box over the bar code...and you don't even have to push a button.
__label__1 Easy to scan! Super!
__label__1 I don't use QR Codes often. When I do have one to scan, I want the process to be simple and easy. QR Droid is reliable, opens quickly and automatically scans a QR code when passed in front of one.Then it opens the link automatically as well.Simple and do
__label__1 I have used other scanners, this one is faster and easier and opened the website better than the other apps I have tried in the past.
__label__1 This is really cool Anywhere I go I can scan the item or items and this app can read it. Whether I use the &#34;scanner&#34; or take a picture from my camera.  I can also create my own and it remembers what I have scanned before. It works fast and effici
__label__1 This is the app for Android that will download barcodes etc.  Very handy. I like having it available when I am shopping.
__label__0 It takes up a lot of space on my phone and I don't ever use it.  But when I do use it,  which is rarely, it works great.
__label__1 Simple and fast are the two words that easily describe QR Droid. I use this each week at minimum as our church has a QR code on the back of the church bulletin for the weekly Sunday service. Once you scan the code, the QR Droid takes you to the church we
__label__0 This app requireds unneeded permissions, including reading contacts and web history which it can upload with full network access.  Do not support these apps!
__label__1 Works the first time out of the box on off brand android 4.04 tablets.  I have not review all parts of this app only the QR reader.Great software
__label__1 Love this scanner.I wish this had caught on faster. The codes just don't seem to be as many places as it could or should be. I hope it doesn't just go away, though I will admit that even me, a proponent for this sort of cool code scanner, thinks it isn't
__label__1 this is a nice app simple and it works plus it takes the picture automatically when is sees the code properly
__label__0 I don't use droid because I have an iPhone and so I use apple and I have a contract with Verizon
__label__1 I can never remember my #. So now I just send my contact card, or let them scan it! I'm gonna use this a lot.
__label__1 I seldom give 5 stars for anything.It does as advertised, It is ad free, Fast and accurate, easy to use!
__label__1 Would love it even more if I could have the option to resize the icons. This could be something the dev could include in a future update. But besides this point I'm very satisfied with this pack and Im looking forward for new ones.
__label__1 A moral imperative add on for CircleLauncher. Worth the price. 'Nuff said! This is a great add on for the add on.
__label__1 I had $2 in Amazon App Store money to spend and I purchased this icon pack to compliment the Circle Launcher app. I love all the options although I will probably only use 2 or 3 of them. I love beautifying my home screens and this added much more to it. 
__label__1 Immediately bought this after downloading the app. It's a great addition for customizing the widget, I like that I can mix and match the symbol and widget color.
__label__1 you will love your circle launcher even more when you buy these icons. the other icon pack as well. Very well worth it. eye pleasing way to organize your phone.
__label__1 This calculator is leaps and bounds better than the stock android calculator. I love the memory function. The UI is clean and very easy to use. This is one of two free apps that I use that I felt compelled to donate money to the author. It's that good. (
__label__1 the perfect display on the Fire and works great on Android phones. I've used it for almost a year and I used it over my standard HTC calculator. Highly recommended.
__label__1 When I first downloaded this app it took me a while to get used to the blocks. It doesn't look like a calculator app so I kept passing it up on my Kindle. Now I'm used to the icon and I use it all the time. I definitely recommend it.
__label__1 This app is easy to use. It is easy to read. I would recomend it for anybody who just neeeds to do calculations in a hurry.
__label__1 The Cube Calculator is a joy to use. Its interface is simple, yet works harmoniously on my Motorola Xoom and my Droid X. Try this one out for its good looks, speed and gives you what you want simplicity.
__label__1 one of the best free calcs w/o irritating ads - easy to use and keeps a history of numbers when adding a list
__label__1 I wish I would have used this before purchasing the one by stormin dorman. this is hands down the best calc on the amazon store
__label__1 Very simple and easy to use. Extra large display makes it a pleasure to use. Very convenient for quick calculations and checkbook balancing.
__label__1 The fact that this app is not only free BUT ad free as well is icing on the cake. Most apps that I purchase are disappointing a large majority of the time. The descriptions provide on most apps are rather exaggerated and are not quite as useful as they c
__label__1 I chose this app based on a book recommendation.  The app works fine and is very easy to use.  The large display is helpful for those with low vision.  It is also very bright.  Now a misplaced calculator is a thing of the past!
__label__1 well, first of all, what I look for in a calculator of any kind, app or plastic, I make sure it has decent calculation features. check. decent amount of digits? it has infinite digits. check. plus it tells you the answer to the equation instantly, has yo
__label__1 This calculator has more signs than any other calculator i've ever used! Its really nice for trying to do math homework!
__label__1 I have tried many calculator apps, but I could never find one that I liked better than my hp, until this on.  I like that it displays both the answer and the equation, and the equation is editable if I need to correct or change it.
__label__1 I wanted to have a simple, easy-to-use calculator without all the bells and whistles for my Kindle Fire. After trying several other calculator apps, I stumbled upon this one and discovered that it fits the bill quite nicely.
__label__1 This is a good scientific calculator.  When you swipe your finger from right to left it shows another set of keys that handle logarithms and permutations and has a key for pi.  After you get an answer you can hold your finger down on the answer and a men
__label__1 This is a good calculator it's large enough and can do just about anything on it.  Very user friendly. Which makes it easy.
__label__1 At last a perfect calculator, and one that actually has a division sign instead of a slash. I can only suggest one change and that is not to the program but, to its Icon. The blocks are great but how about adding a plus sign?  Blocks indicating 1+2=3 wou
__label__1 This app works well on Kindle Fire.  I was pleased by how easily the app downloaded to my Kindle Fire.  I tried more than one free calculator and this one is very good. I have no complaint.  The best is it was FREE!
__label__1 Simple, clean, great function - and a great value. Considering most apps like this either cost a buck or throw in ads, its welcome addition to the device.
__label__0 the search function is useless. tried locating by map feature and that was a no go.  I would recommend this cluster****.
__label__1 Fun and interesting to look at towns and scenery around the world.  It would be nice if it could find my google maps, but not that vital. You can save and categorize lots of favorites.
__label__1 This app is amazing! You can search for live feeds and weather all over the world!!. Great for people who watch the weather especially like: fishermen, skiers, etc. You will simply be amazed! how fast everything is, wow!!.. Remember always though: It's E
__label__1 I don't sleep well and in the wintertime nights seem so long.  But I know it's daylight somewhere - so I travel the world with this app.  They seem to be adding more streaming cameras with each update, which is a bonus.  Instead of a picture you get real
__label__1 I love the random locations, and especially in places I may never get to visit. It's also good to see places and help look for fun on upcoming vacations.
__label__1 it is like taking an around the world tour. Some cameras better than others. clicking on random and see 10 different cities is fun.
__label__0 didn't work.  only had about 40 webcams.  map had error message.  poor ap.  didn't work on kindle fire.  no streaming cams
__label__1 This is a nicely designed basic math review app., though set up is a bit involved (so many options to choose from).Runs fine on Kindle Fire and it's free.Many thanks to the designer/publisher!
__label__1 this kills bozos &amp; makes them a lot better with the facts I barly knew my facts &amp; I'm in6 th grade! this tots HELPS ME GET IT! !!!!!!'!!!!!!!! ;) ***** :) &lt;3
__label__1 This app is great in that you have to solve the problems and not choose an answer from a predetermined list (multiple choice).  My math deficient 2nd grader took to it like a fish to water and I have watched as her confidence in her math skills have soar
__label__1 &#34;Let's do the Math&#34; is a simple arithmetic learning aid. It's customizable enough to make it useful for kids from preschool to about 8-9 years old.When you first load up the app, you have several choices to make. In &#34;Tasks to do,&#34; you set
__label__0 This apps instructions are very hard to follow, and there isn't much of them. Also, like I said in the title of my review it only goes up to 2nd grade math. I found this app pretty useless. There is no timer, it's hard to figure out and not at all user f
__label__1 Good for a reviewer or refresher, my girls love the program. It helps with enjoying math more as well.  Playing makes it feel like fun instead of learning.
__label__0 I do not reccomend this because every time I try to play it takes me to the amazon webpage! if u download this u will regretted it.
__label__1 I like this one because you can set it to where you have to enter the answer instead of giving multiple choice. On the multiple choice apps, he just hit answers until he gets the right one and does not think about it or learn his facts. He is memorizing 
__label__0 seriously, if youre in debt, get out a pencil and paper and figure out a plan. this app is useless and cannot aid a serious attempt to pay down debts. for starters, cancel your data plan and sell your expensive phone. and definitely dont waste money on s
__label__0 This thin  does no  help me. Perhaps this is an app for someone who doe  not have that many bills but for me with more than 10 it does  no  help me.
__label__0 This doesn't give any real help. The strategy should always be lowest debt to highest to wipe out more faster. Don't download. Listen to Dave Ramsey instead.
__label__1 I have a budget app. I wanted an app to help decide the order and amount payments to pay off cards and loans. This fills the bill. Appreciate!!
__label__0 app says its free today but when i try to download it errors out saying i need to add a payment method to my amazon one click settings.
__label__1 I am familiar with most of the debt reduction plans that are used in this app. I can tell you that this makes it really easy.  I couldn't be happier. Easily compare different methods of payment and how each one will pay off balances and when. If you are 
__label__1 Five stars for the funny developer review. Love that sense of humor! App is nice basic app for those who want to keep a handle on how deep a hole they're digging themselves into debt.
__label__1 app is very usefull i got my amazon market debt paid off.. ;) good layout,...................................................................................................................................................................... good good app
__label__1 I love reading reviews it's like a mini soap show ppl whine way too much oh no the developer left reviews omg so did their friends boohoo who cares?! try the app review it not the developer reviews if it's great then ok if not oh well get over it. as for
__label__1 All of the calculations this app does can be figured out with a little magic in Excel.  But if you are either unskilled in that area, or lazy (that is my category) then this app can help you decide which debts to pay off and how much debt you will have a
__label__1 This is a relatively simple app that lets you enter in each of your debts and an overall monthly payment. It then calculates how long it will take to pay them all off. It lets you try different scenarios  of payoff order to see which way is quicker and c
__label__1 I find this app easy to use and quite helpful.  I love the export feature!  I can export my plan to an excel file, email it to myself, then print it.  I like marking off the payments as I make them.  It gives me a sense of accomplishment.  I had a questi
__label__1 This app is the greatest app to ever come along.  Anybody who doesn't download this should just kill themselves.  This app will do everything in the description,  plus cure cancer,  solve world hunger, and keep Arnold Schwarzenegger from getting any more
__label__0 This item is just what it says. It just did not meet my particular need. This app is limited.Does not have much going for it.
__label__1 So easy to use! This is the BEST debt payoff calculator that I've found on the internet. I've used it to amoritize my credit card debt and I'm digging myself out of the hole by following the payoff plan recommended in the plan. I can't give this app enou
__label__0 You must be really pathetic to have to review your own app that apparently sucks. obvious when all reviews are either five stars or one!
__label__1 glad to see developer has a sense of humorous &amp; the rest of these twats need to jump off a bridge!! ill never use this app., but they got my dollar for tickling my funny bone!
__label__1 If you need an app to tell you how to pay off debt I think you have bigger problems.  An app won't stop you from buying Starbucks or tell you it's only $2.00 more for quality gasoline.  It's also not going to yell at you when you buy snacks for a road tr
__label__0 every time I try to enter information it force closes. not to mention it suckered me into buying an additional app which I can't find to download! !!!!!  Now I know why I don't do this crap on my phone or kindle fire!
__label__1 I'm not the developer, and the app isnt the greatest.  It does seem to function rather well  it hasn't cured me of cancer.  Mainly because I dont have it, but it has cured my lack of a smile from all the drama queen reviews!
__label__1 wow, did anyone think to consider that the 'reviews' the developer supposedly left could be a prank? because this app actually made the world a better place... really, it's completely changed my life. app isn't for everyone
__label__1 This app is really nice! Nice and colorful tabs. Love that this app syncs with my Google calendar. Has alarms. Can set dates by week, days, months. This will be my main calendar app. I can set agenda's, folder's, private things, make lists. I was really 
__label__1 Works great on both Motorola razr and my Hubby's Droid x. We sync both calendars easily. I like that I can set colors for different members of the family, and I can do things like save an event to repeat every other Monday and Wednesday.
__label__0 on kindle fire it doesn't sync with google calendar, only task manager. tries to install on my Droid 2 to see if functionality was different than on Kindle Fire. on my Froissart it just crashes as soon as installation is complete. this app is worthless
__label__1 I love this app. It syncs with Google for me. I like that I can choose which calendar to have events show up on.
__label__0 Does not match screenshots but is a decent app.Nothing different than using Google calendar and has interesting permission request s
__label__0 I found this like many as FAOTD.  That being said, I got my money's worth.  The add says you can sync, but like the other reviews I found... you cannot.  Out dated, as a new version has been released.  No help files, or support.
__label__1 Great app for google calendaring.  And I got it for free as a FAOTD!I highly recommend it if you're looking for a replacement for the stock google calendar.I'm using it on a Xoom with ICS.
__label__0 I've used this since the first version for pocket pc. The android version seems to be a bit sparse. The only thing that kept me from buying this was the lack of a widget. I still squeed a bit when it was the free app of the day.
__label__1 I always read reviews before I download anything free, paid, or faotd. This time I decided against the majority of poor reviews and downloaded anyways. I have a nexus 7 2012. This looks exactly like the screen shots for me. Not only that, it synced every
__label__1 this app, on any platform is always one of the best. we all know the difficulty in programming for android market. this developer had been replying to everyone. I am using this and am very impressed with project to date and responses do far. I know it wi
__label__0 Ok, I downloaded it. Now what? Not user-friendly, and no instructions. Maybe others can figure it out, but for me the amount I've time I've already wasted makes this useless. I've added tasks but can't find them. I'm frustrated by this app.
__label__1 Pocket Informant is an excellent calendar app that keeps getting better all the time. I've tried most calendar apps and it's one of only two I consider usable.
__label__1 It is even synching with my gmail account. I'm a Mom of 4 kids and a college student. I'm going to love this app!
__label__0 Sub tasks are not indented.  No widget.  The calendar views are pretty enough, but even for free it's a waste if space.I use "Google Task Organizer" and "Calendar Pad".  They have free versions, but even if you buy both, that's $6 instead of $10, and the
__label__1 This app is great and works flawlessly. For you Amazon Fire users, there IS NO Google calendar on your device because it is not an official Google product. There is nothing wrong with this app and should not be rated down because your device is lacking.I

__label__1 I apologize. I do not remember this application. Evidently, I have deleted it from my tablet. I am still giving it a 5 star rating though. Sometimes, I just delete application which I do not use or have too much memory.
__label__1 Not sure why others having sync issues...I installed and immediately saw my calendars All 5 of them.  Works great although only spent about 15 minutes so far but really really like the various layouts with a calendar view with list of events below it.  K

__label__1 I got my new Kindle Fire yesterday and needed a calendar.  I don't use Google calendars or any others and so I was frustrated that every calendar app seemed to want to sync to another account which I didn't have.  I just wanted to be able to enter events
__label__1 honestly I just made this review because I feel bad for the app people. it can't sync with Google on Kindle Fire because of the way Kindle Fire is made. not because of the app. although I'd be livid if I'd spent ten dollars on it...but it's the FAOTD (Fr
__label__0 Disappointing that this does not sync with Google Calendar. As a Fire and Android user, I've been looking for a good free calendar for the Fire, and had hoped this would be it. Unfortunately, it's not.
__label__0 Seems to be working very well so far.  No glitches or problems that I can see.  The only thing I don't like is that appointments all default to 15 minute alarm setting so I have to change every one.  15 minute notice is not enough for most people that us
__label__1 it has a steep learning curve but once you get used to it you'll realize that it is an awesome replacement for the default calendar. I use this all the time to keep my appointments and reminders. The only things it  is lissing is synching with google cal
__label__0 Wow free app of the day and it is the old version. Way to go Amazon. Don't waste your tim eon the out of date app.
__label__0 With the last update the Kindle Fire version has gone from "marginally usable" to "will not run at all".If a product that is essentially a calendar has to state "Kindle Fire doesn't support calendar", then it shouldn't be offered for sale on the Fire.
__label__0 Just tried this out and it seemed like it was going to do the job for me (I don't care about snyching to the Google Calendar). My big thing was that it needs to work offline, and it seems that it does. However, when I tried to add a contact,it promptly c

__label__0 I agree with a another review, how can they pass this off as a 9.99 app when this is v2 and they have released v3?  Luckily for me it was the free app of the day, but I still uninstalled it immediately. Amazon is partially at fault for offering an out of
__label__0 They sing praises about features of this app that are not even available. They should have to call this app by another name because it is not the Pocket Informant I have used before from the Google play market.
__label__0 App continues to freeze/force close. If this issue is ever fixed I may change my opinion. However in the meantime I will continue to rely on Google Calendar.
__label__1 I have been wanting an app like this for a long time. Exactly what I was looking for, maybe now I can get organized. Thank you!
__label__0 If you're concerned about your privacy...steer clear of this app. It requires far too many permissions (most notably, access to your email) than is absolutely necessary. Use the OEM calendar instead.
__label__1 Loads contacts for you when you connect to email. Calendars are easier to use than others I've used. Like having everything in one place and I don't have to buy a calendar every year to put in my binder!
__label__0 This is v2. The devs came out with a (almost) completely rewritten v3 app. That means this one is an old, obsolete version and a poor FAOTD offering. Very disappointed.
__label__1 I have used Pocket Informant as my calendar app for years. Works great. I especially like the view that looks just like a paper calendar.No, it doesn't work on a Kindle.  Giving this app a low rating because of that,  when it tells you right up front tha
__label__1 I've looked at probably a hundred task and time management apps and PI has one of the most detailed implementations of the GTD method that I've seen. I have both the iPhone and the iPad versions and I'm very happy with both of them. It comes with no less
__label__0 I can't figure out how to enter account information for my google calendar / tasks account or my exchange calendar. Why would amazon pick this for the app of the day when there are millions of kindle fire owners that can't use it. not impressed. kindle f
__label__1 By the time I read through the reviews and opened the app, the calendar  had sync'd with google before i pressed any  buttons other than &quot;open&quot;. For the OS users, sync that to google and it should be fine. Also, I believe that there is a toggle
__label__0 Excellent calendar, unfortunately it keeps making me sign in to Amazon to authenticate, sometimes more than once a day. takes 5 minutes to go through the process just to check my calendar. If not for that it is a great calendar.
__label__1 This app is by far the most useful calender app available for the Kfire, and to get it for free is a bonus. It has exactly what I need, its simple to figure out. I must admit that I don't have anything set up through tootle and I don't care to import my

__label__1 Sync's up smoothly with google calendar, I like the option of mini text on the monthly view so I can see a quick overview of all upcoming plans. No complaints yet
__label__1 I hate seeing an app flamed due to reviewers inability. Someone was mislead by the product description? Learn to read. Says nothing about google tasks. Doesn't work on kindle fire? That doesn't make the app suck. It means your kindle fire sucks.Runs just

__label__0 I have used this app since it was in Beta (October 2010). Since the first beta til launch (nearly 5 months) the app barely improved. I bought it at launch for $6. Since then, they've raised the price. As a free app, I'd download it and try it. You've got
__label__1 This is quite a useful app. It is like a digital day planner and more. It's easy to use and has so many helpful things to help keep appointments, birthdays and all organized. You'll have no excuses for missing dates, times, addresses, anniversaries etc. 
__label__0 Very great app, but they dumbed it down to make it cheaper.  Not cool. All other markets get the Outlook sync features, except Amazon. Might be OK for tablet users, but really sucks for phone users. Will change to 5 stars if we get the missing feature.
__label__1 Great task manager, calendar, event scheduler. Lots of customization options available. Very kind of the developer to offer this as the free app of the day. Thanks!
__label__1 Works great on the Kindle Fire.  I really wanted and needed a calander / to do / reminder type program for my Fire.  Works great.  Thanks for the gift Amazon.
__label__1 I dont know what those other reviewers downloaded, but the color tabs are there, the easy to use calendar including the full 31 day or week views, all the screenshots are accurate.  This is the same great product i grew to love back on my pocket pc.
__label__0 the other reviews are being untruthful again, this synced my Google accounts automatically and other calenders perfectly. but again Amazon deleted my 4 star review. They never delete one stars so here you go.Great app. if you take the time to look at it 
__label__0 They ported it to android without using any of androids capabilities. Business calender free is way better. Needs a ton of work and is useless without a widget.
__label__0 I used this on the iPhone.  I thought it was great until I tried Business Calendar for android. This doesn't even come close in terms of usability and rivaling a desktop experience. Buisiness Calendar has much better calendar views.
__label__1 There isn't space enough to do this app justice.  I haven't learned all of the features of Pocket Informant, but just the calendar features are outstanding.  Some of the features that make it stand out are: the ability to sync and update with my other ca

__label__1 I usually don't review apps but I just downloaded this app since I use my calander just about everyday.This app just seemed easier and more interesting to use. So I'm very happy with it. It synced with my Google calander with no problem.I'm using HTC G2.
__label__1 I downloaded this app because I thought it would be pretty cool to have a top-of-the-line agenda app on my phone but was quickly disappointed. As I sat with the app open, I realized I had nothing to do this week. Or next. Or the next. Nothing. Not even s
__label__0 After great success with it one day  it crashed and I have lost six months of appointments and am furious!!!  How do I retrieve them???  Not at all dependable.....and I used to rave about how great it was!!! Bad bad bad!!
__label__1 I thought it would be better. Most reviewers complained about syncing issues but I didn't care about that. I had some force close issues when changing daily and weekly views. I also couldn't figure out how to turn off the highlighted work times, even tho
__label__1 I was impressed at first but... Firstly after two months of information went on - as well as another 3 months forward, I received the following error:  "Sorry - The application Pocket INformant (process net.webis.pocketinformant) has stopped unexpectedly
__label__0 Couldn't find any way to make this useful. I like my calendar and Noodles app better. Mayne I wad missing something, but everytime I tried to get into it, ther was nothing to do. Uninstalled.
__label__0 Please don't buy.  This app does not sync with anything and when you check with the developers you are told it is a kindle fire problem and not theirs.  Yes if you are selling on a kindle fire amazon store then you are responsible. Instead of removing th
__label__0 The bottom of the calender is at the very top of my screen. It's a useless app. Don't get it and don't buy it. There are other an  better free planner apps.
__label__1 I have been trying calendar after calendar app trying to find one that works well, looks good is simple and effective... This is the first one that fills all those requirements.
__label__0 They came out with version 3 already so for a free app they give us version 2, um yea...........would have rather the version 3 be the faotd instead of this....
__label__1 This is one of the most complete todo apps on the market and it works perfectly on the atrix 4g. It does use your built in calendar to get the days agenda, so if you have google calendar it should work
__label__0 Once again another big failure for nice calendars. It does not sync with Google in the Kindle Fire. I thought that was the whole point of spending money in a calendar, it's a good thing I got it for free.I have to say, though, that the interface is nice 
__label__0 When installed on the Kindle Fire, this app doesn't sync with Google Calendar - it only works as a standalone application. Without sync, this app is pretty useless.
__label__0 The actual product looks nothing like the screen shots. Also, this does nothing that my phones calander does not already do. Glad I tried this as the free app of the day so I did not have to waste my money.
__label__0 This could be a great program if it was compatible with Android 2.3 or better. It does not work with Vizio vtab tablet. Not compatible after upgrade.
__label__0 Sorry, but this program is useless on a Kindle Fire HD. It just doesn't work. It may be a good Android program on phones or other tablets, but don't download for Kindle Fire HD.
__label__0 My 4 year-old didn't even like it and that isn't saying much at all.  Do not get this item you will delete it quick
__label__0 I got this app to use from a friend's recommendation and was so excited till I tried to download it, and found out that it wasn't compatible on my Kindle Fire HD......:-(
__label__0 I dont know why but for some reason it says it needs a feature enabled and everytime I enable it to try it, it doesn't work.  Not sure why.
__label__0 I wilsh all of the apps you download were very easy and self-explanitary. I could not even try it because it was too hard to do anything with!
__label__0 This app freezes once you change keyboard settings. It sucks and it makes me hate this kindle more and more. Should have bought a Nexus tablet.
__label__0 My &#34;  TOP OF THE LINE KINDLE FIRE 8.9 &#34; 4 G  L  T  E @ $ 400. &#34;  will not run this. This compatibility and other issues where apps need permission to run on kindle makes me think I made a poor decision in choosing to buy 2 kindle fires 6 mont
__label__0 Thought it would be fun to scan lables on kindle fire.  App loaded but tells me to change keyboard type.  Tried, cant.  App won't work-disappointed.
__label__1 Fun when your bored, or with friends. This version offers more questions:)) Love it, I started with free version but upgraded right away!!
__label__1 This is the best mash app ever. You can pick your own questions and save and email your results. It does cost 99 cents but it's worth every penny. In my opinion it's the best mash game ever. The only downer is the email doesn't work on the kindle fire.
__label__1 I love mash! 40 years ago in 5th grade me and my pals played this! when I showed them there we so happy &quot;lol&quot; as the cool kids say
__label__1 this app is effing amazing me n my friends can b stupid n its worth the 99 cents i always play this game but you will have fun with it just use ur immagination
__label__0 Dumb, pointless and crashes all the time. Note that all the 5-star reviews follow just about the same pattern? That's because they were written by the same brilliant mind who wrote this waste of a &quot;game&quot;.
__label__1 I got this app because i like to play it with my friends on paper, but that takes awoke. So i saw this app for free, but got the other one. It has a ton of questions you can choose from. I know, it costs 99&cent;, but hey, you will use it a lot and it is
__label__1 I always am playing this game with my friends. we love it so.much as.an 11 year old girl this prompts my imagination giving me better grades in subjects like English. buy it buy it buy it
__label__1 awesome app! so fun to play everywhere! cute and charming, I love how you can email and save your stories! I totally recommend this app!!!!!!
__label__1 this game is the most awesome game I have ever played I love all the mashes I love it so good
__label__1 I luv this!!!!!!I did this to my sis and just to say,her life STINKS. hahaha!!!!!!! so fun I recommend this game for EVERYONE&iexcl;!!!!!!!!!!!!
__label__0 I didn't buy it but it sounds the.same as.the free.version. q w e r t y :) la la la
__label__1 Its sooo funny when im hanging out with my friends and using this app.i luv it. yhu should totally download it!!
__label__1 And my quest for the perfect (and free) stop watch app continues...So far, this one is the best I could find and it's as close to 'perfect' as they come. Briefly, this is what you get out of it:- Count up or down (to switch back from count down must 'zer
__label__1 This stop watch app does all I need.  Fast response interface.  Count down timer.  Lap timer, that has the splits listed on the main screen for easy comparison.
__label__1 It's a great stop watch, and we use it for home-school related activities as well as for Bible Drill timing.Easy to use, and easy to reset - love the "restart" option to be set for pushing the start button - each time you touch the start button, it will 
__label__0 I tried to use this app for time-sensitive art, and for counting down it was fine.  But, the problem is that it never stops.  All day long I get the notification that the count is done, but I never set it!  The app does its own thing.  Uninstall.
__label__1 I was looking for a good app to let me time various events (grilling steaks, recording movies, etc.) and this app fits the bill.  It has many more options than I need and it's free, can't beat that!
__label__1 User friendly and gives options on the usage. Good for classroom timings or sporting events. Easy to read but no sounds.
__label__0 Did not work as well as I wanted on a Kindle Fire.  I found other clocks that met my needs.
__label__1 works great. only complaint is that start stop buttons too small...perhaps an option to change would help some. like that it functions as a stopwatch and a countdown timer.
__label__0 this is the worst app i ever got. this app wil keep reseting itself every day waisting your battery. if u use ur divice for everything have fun with the annoying beeps and battery wastage.  DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!
__label__1 Just read the title till your convinced to buy the app. way better than the homework app I gave 2 stars. this one is G -R -E -A -T!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
__label__0 My device is protected by a security provider I trust completely called TrustGo. It says that this is a high security risk because it uses a what sounded like a Japanese scam website that is basically a bunch of hackers who put viruses on your device. Th
__label__0 It is a stop watch plain and simple so that part gets 5 stars. However, when using it on my Kindle Fire it continues to make notifications pop up saying it is done counting when it wasn't even being used! A very annoying side effect.
__label__1 I just needed a simple stop watch because I like to take my resting heart rate throughout the day, it does the trick
__label__1 Good app 4 timing people. I like it. I am hungry. Man, cake sounds soooooooo good right now, ooohhh, i have an idea! BYE SUCKERS!!!!!
__label__1 Clean, simple and easy to use... thank you!  Nice options as well.  To add even more usefulness,  please consider having the sound at the end of a countdown be continuous or repeat until stopped.  This would make this app not only the excellent stopwatch
__label__1 LISTEN TO MY POST ABOUT THIS APP OR IF YOU DONT LISTEN, DOWNLOAD IT FOR YOURSELF!! I LOVE THIS APP!! I CANT THJNK OF ANYTHING ELSE TO SAY SO ITS AWESOME,TRY IT OUT, IF YOU DONT LIKE IT THAT IS YOUR OPINION BUT I WILL KEEP MINE OUT THERE!!
__label__1 Obviously based on the game Dominion I became hooked on this app instantly. I hope for a version 2 or update adding more conquests as I worked through them quickly. I still love to play though on quick mode. Great game.
__label__1 Test device: Samsung Epic, Android 2.2I never really got into the trading card games like Magic and the like, but got a passing familiarity with them and how they are played. I decided to go ahead and give Fortunes of War a shot, mostly because I liked t
__label__1 I'd like to say this is a good way to spend a few minutes, but I've spent too much on it to truthfully claim it's ONLY a few minutes. The game is, as already written, much like Dominion, with a tarot-like fantasy theme. What's cool is that in each scenar

__label__1 I have played this game alot. The game is very easy to learn and has got a lot of options.
__label__1 I was a little concerned that the accuracy of a bubble level on a phone would be even remotely useful. I found the retro camera's level pretty accurate, so I gave the RIDGID a try, and was delighted that it handled level and plumb as well as a standard 4
__label__1 This RIDGID "Digital Bubble Level" is incredibly useful, works perfectly after being calibrated (easy to do), supports the camera (allowing alignment with cross-hairs), and is free without adds. The three bubble levels displayed at the same time makes le
__label__1 This is one of those apps that does what it says it will do. As long as you have a source for calibrating it it will give good readings. It's also handy for checking the angle on, let's say, a table saw. You zero it to your table then find out what angle
__label__1 This is a very cool app. It is a level that is very accurate, has 45 degrees, Vertical, and horizontal levels. Reads out in degrees out of level. Has a calibration adjustment as well. very handy.
__label__1 Plain and simple - this turns your tablet into a bubble level.  I know there are 3 or 4 levels in our house and garage, but finding one when I need it is time consuming.  I always know where my tablet is so I will be using this one quite often.  PS - you
__label__1 This works great, BUT... you have to take any case off you phone or it won't be accurate.  I use an Otterbox Defender and taking it off at a job site is not an option.  But I wasn't really expecting it would replace my old-fashioned bubble level.This has
__label__0 I downloaded it on my iPad and then it said I need adobe air so I downloaded that and it still would not work
__label__1 Good for use on the fly when you don't have access to your tools. Appears to be reasonably accurate in most situations.
__label__1 This is outstanding.  Would love it if they produced one of these for the physical world!  I would love it if they added a virtual plumb line and table top bubble level.
__label__1 This is cool. I'm hoping to get how to work it properly. This can be really helpful for stuff around the house.
__label__1 Who would have guessed that this app would be so sensative?  It even measures down to tenths of a degreee!Fun application!
__label__1 The level can be set to make a tome so you can HEAR when something is level if you can't see the display.
__label__1 This is so simple. I was always losing my little level. Now it's on my phone and it works just fine, at least for making sure pictures are straight.
__label__1 works great on my droid 2.2 - remember you need adobe air. nice work! I have not had a chance to use it for a project, just tested it out. but I never know where my levels are and phones always there.
__label__1 i tried a couple apps for bubble levels. They all were the same. This one gives you the addition of an angle .
__label__1 I was using another app for a while; but this one provides three types of leveling at the same time.  I wish it could be magnified; but it still does a good job and is easy to use.
__label__1 This is simply wonderful! what a great addition to have it make a sound when level. perfect for when outside and can barely make out the screen. Thanks Dev!
__label__1 This is a great use of the tablet's gyroscope.  It's a level and works great at being just that....whether you want something leveled horizontally or vertically, it works like a charm.  No more turning the level to level out the table...just set the tabl
__label__0 It may be innocuous, but look at the permissions for this app:&#34;PowerManager WakeLocks to keep processor from sleeping or screen from dimming&#34;I'd also question why they need access to networks, but my big problem today is with the above.I do not w
__label__0 this is the 2nd worst app I have ever downloaded on my kindle, as there are little directions. any time you mess up, you have to restart the level which causes you to loose points.
__label__1 Remember those tile games we played as kids? There was one open space and the object was to figure out how to slide the tiles around and finally complete a pattern?Well, this is kinda like that, but not. Lol...how is that for vague?It's a simple strategy
__label__1 When I first played this I was hooked. I love puzzle games. I haven't played in the pass few days though. Just had to take a break and try other games. I assure you that I will return to play this app.
__label__1 If you like puzzles that are mind-boggling, then this is for you!  I love this game.  It gets very frustrating, but I love the challenge.  I play the relaxed mode so I can take my time and think about what the next move will be.  It's very addictive, and
__label__0 I am 8 and this app is NASTY I've only had it for 2 days and zip through it just to get some ideas and even on normal only mode there is some ADULT CONTENT. If children play this I'd say they are very IDIOTIC children. I highly recommend the mangobird on
__label__1 Remember playing it when I was young so got this for my girls.  They love it and have a lot of fun.
__label__0 The developer did not include a check to see if the question had recently been asked, so it tends to dare people to do the same things over and over. Variation would be an improvement.
__label__0 I was playing this and it kept telling me to&quot; wrap yourself up like a party present&quot; and it was annoying
__label__0 I got this and immediately deleted it because it asked me if I wanted to play adult dares.... ummmmm I don't think so. I'm not gonna have anything with adult content I'm 14!! Shouldn't have adult games for sale in a kids app store!
__label__1 This is a good app, but it left me wanting more. It is one the better truth or dare apps, though. It is NOT at all inappropriate for all the parents and sensible children reading this. It is a great game for sleepovers and parties! There are many ads, so
__label__0 there are ads taking up the whole page almost. images are real grainy and cheap. dares suck. &quot;put peanut butter under one armpit and jelly the other. wipe it off with bread and eat it&quot; don't waste your time
__label__0 Are you serious I am so dissatisfied with this app I mean the whole point of this game is to make you laugh or get really surprised or something happy but seriously this is just stupid it says wrap yourself up in a Christmas present as a dare and for tru
__label__1 this app is just wat i was looking for i had some really good sex all night it was.the best night of my entire life
__label__0 I am only 9 and this game is gross i was checking what some of the dares wereand it said take of your pants and sit on the opposite sex of you for 30 seconds so don't get this app I AM WARNING YOU DONT GET THIS APP.
__label__0 I am 13 and this is the grossest app ever. it told me to strip to no clothes and for thirty seconds anobody in the room can rub or massage e anywhere. I do not approve of this app and I do not recommend it for kids around my age. I would really appreciat
__label__0 everybody hates this app so I do too.  ads suck. now add several more words to tell u I hate. apps with too many ads.
__label__0 OMG this app is terrible. The jokes are terrible with the little jokes there are! If you want my oppinion don't get this app!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ):
__label__0 these are not even jokes like seriously who just thinks they are good they are horrible. ew. i wouldnt dare look at it
__label__0 look you should see how much i hate it there is like thousands of adds and there are nearly any jokes and guess what you wouldn't believe that there is this person said it should be rated five stars and stuff like that i just wish that person would be in
__label__0 Did not work on my kindle fire at ALL!  after entering all of the tedious required info in order to link up my various accounts it would not find places on foursquare or even go back.  This useless app was quickly uninstalled!  don't waste your time!
__label__1 I couldn't resist. I Love this product because it allows me the opportunity to manage all of my social platforms at once and schedule posts when I know that I am not available. If I have an issue with the app I just tweet hootsuite and they respond right
__label__1 I use it all  the time for our customers for advertising on the web, tweet, etc.recommend it to all.
__label__1 Loving Hoot on Fire. Don't fancy twitter app, tried tweet caster for weeks, way too slow although liked features. Tried Hoot to speed things up &amp; it really flies on my Fire, &amp; features are excellent.  give it a try!
__label__1 it does what I expect and it is great. I only use it for twitter and its the best twitter app ive used.
__label__1 If Twitter seems overwhelming, but you can see some intrinsic value for your business/cause/event, I suggest HootSuite for managing all those streams and #topics. I must say I like TweetDeck's ability to allow a longer post, but w/ practice, you'll get t
__label__1 This app makes it ready and convenient to keep track of all my social networks. I would definately recommend it.
__label__1 Whether business or personal or both.... this IS the APP.  Great on pc or mac .. seamless on Android and Fire.  Have used Pro for 4 (four)years for self and three (3) clients.  I can see ALL ACCTS INCL Facebooks, LinkedIn, Twitter, ON TEN ACCTS AT ONCE. 
__label__1 I love being able to juggle my personal and business twitter accounts at the same time.  Huge time saver.  Must have.
__label__1 I am very impressed with this free app. The interface is very user friendly. I enjoy using it just as much as the desktop version. There are no annoying ads. I would very much recommend this app.
__label__0 Every time I try log in to twitter it tells me there is an incorrect username and password... but I haven't even been able to add my twitter username or password. Facebook works fine. So frustrating. It seems like a common problem between all KF twitter 
__label__1 You can use it as a basic twitter client, but the real power.comes from having multiple accounts and getting the same power as the website. You can even go to the website when away from your tablet to schedule tweets,.etc. I love the product and think th
__label__1 HootSuite is my twitter and facebook client of choice. It makes scanning all my twitter lists a quick and easy task. I use it on both my Kindle Fire and Galaxy S3 with no problems at all.
__label__0 I could not get this app to work correctly but it might be my crummy no-name tablet.  I just kept getting stuck in a loop between setting up the account and adding any social media account.  I just uninstalled.  But it may work well for you.
__label__0 I was loving this app until the update three days ago. Now it won't even load my accounts. Litterally nothing at all. Just a blank page. Now I've had to switch back to Tweetcaster and my regular Facebook app. Why do these apps keep having updates that ru
__label__1 This is definitely one of if not the best app that combines multiple social networking sites. Fortunately it's a free download, however, I would DEFINITELY pay  for this app if I had to! Congrats to the developers, and thanks for such an efficient yet ef
__label__1 HootSuite is a great app for managing multiple Twitter accounts, plus Facebook, and others. The free version will allow up to 4 Twitter accounts. It can post pics, shorten links, retweet in different ways, and more. It's quite versatile. Hootsuite is my 
__label__1 This is a good FREE tool to manage my twitter feeds and status on FB and Linked In.  I'll keep it.
__label__0 I just updated the app and it no longer works. Its totally garbage IDK if its hootsuites fault or Amazons but it needs to be fixed ASAP
__label__0 It won't let me add Facebook after I added Twitter and LinkedIn. It says I need to pay for pro to get a 5th stream--but I'm only trying to add a third! Without Facebook, it's pretty much pointless.
__label__1 its all you really need for a program that is meant for multi-posting. if you expect to much you'll be let down, but it does what its meant to do without shutting down so I like it.
__label__1 Those complaining about Foursquare not working on their Kindle Fire: Kindle Fire doesn't have the gps set up needed for foursquare, that's why it isn't in the app store itself! it's not HootSuite's fault!
__label__1 I am a tweetdeck fan but after using Hootsuite I have started to get over the fact that I can't have it on my Kindle. It's a great app and has several features I like better than tweetdeck. Downloading this app is just like getting married to your second
__label__0 horrible game.. to confusing and doesn't even tell you what to do.total waste of time ..would not recomend .not even worth downloading
__label__1 warnig spoiler alert!Love it! Was so hard at first but now I'm done! the guy and Aphrodite was easy! 1.feed goat food 2.ask if she can go with you touch her icoin and to the hill tata! so there's your hint from me now go download this game!lobe it!
__label__0 omg I did not get what to do it was a waste of my time, I wish I didn't get it
__label__0 This app is horrid!There I was, innocently looking for a appropriate truth or dare app, and I came across this one, read the reviews, thought I should try it out. It downloaded in one second, of course I should of suspected it would be bad but really?!??
__label__0 do not get this app!! some of the questions would be: have u ever flashed someone before?remove any 4 articles of clothing for the next 3 rounds.run around outside in nothing but your underwear.yeah very very very dirty app!! I deleted it 2 minutes after
__label__0 Chances, your answer is "no." If you answered the other way, you might love this app. Its got a huge ad every time youbopen it, two more on the title screen, and yet another one for you while you play! Oh, and what a game playing experience you will have
__label__0 one dare said &quot; I dare you to prank call your mom &quot;  that's illegal man! u would get arested
__label__1 I love it. its the best. its so cool dont listen to those loosers. I personnely love it.the best game ever
__label__1 I dare you to get this app it is so awesome me and my freinds play truth or dare all the time but most of the time we can not think of any good ones this totaly helps with that.
__label__1 who cares that stuff is illegal your moms not going to get u arrested this is a good app if u have a problem with what it says to do then uninstall it dont  through a big deal
__label__0 spo stupid all of the truths were things you are just like balh and the dares were amazingly boring.:)Have a lice life!!!!
__label__1 i love it im going to have a slumber party and use this app and it has no bad words in it
__label__0 this game is a rip off. sure its fun once or twice but its the same truth or dare. I was looking toward to playing it with my brother and at parties. disapointing!
__label__1 BUY IT! get it free right now out of this world. yo :) or if you don't which you should but it doesn't. matter anyway ok ok as I was saying if you don't. like it here it is :( babem
__label__0 I waited for 10min. and I am already dead right there.  then I waste my time playing because it keeps doing the same damn thing gosh!
__label__0 This app only does one thing.  You think of a number between 1 and 99 and  it &#34;guesses&#34; your number by process of elimination.  it's a trick that any 3rd grader could do.
__label__1 Get a grip people maybe the s in games refers to you playing multiple times. The app does what it's supposed to do albeit in a bare bones way. The description tells you exactly what it does and it's only  two sentences not one of which is &quot;You won't
__label__1 Reliable, digs out all the stations and can record a program too!  It even has sleep timer for bed time. Lots of other great features too.
__label__1 you can tune in to just about anything... this app is great. however, be advised that the police radios are not generally family friendly and tend to perpetuate racial stereotypes at times. bloomberg and the bbc are instant favorites that i cant receive 
__label__1 I have never been so happy with an app as I am this one. It picks up channels everywhere in the world, including police transmissions and emergency calls. It's easy to use. I'm not going to get windy, the number of good reviews speak for themselves. I'm 
__label__1 I can listen from anywhere and everywhere! AM and FM with or without ear buds. What more coulda anyone want. Thank goodness for the internet and all the creative people who make it outstanding :)
__label__1 It was free during the holidays. Tried it out and it is much nicer than i expected. It has a ton of features and lets me listen to NPR and I can record it. Havent had any issues with local radio other channels it can be finnicky some of the channels take
__label__1 delete tune in radio and then install it again im not sure if your music will still be there but the update will work
__label__1 Honestly, one of the things I was jealous of the iOS devices was getting this app. Now o regret getting the app on my iPod touch. I can always be connected where ever I go! I'm glad to have the ability to record radio, especially with anime and Japanese 
__label__1 I have this on my ipad as well as this version on my Fire.  It is a beautiful, easy to use app.  But I would really like two features that are missing in the version for Fire.  First, I would like to be able to schedule recording rather than have to hit 
__label__1 I moved to a different state and I was so glad to find this app couple months ago.  I never miss my favorite morning show.  Looking forward to recording now great for my busy mornings when I can't really pay attention to the radio.
__label__1 I use this app more than any other. Runs without crashing. TuneIn is always updating app. Well worth the inexpensive price. Could use some tone controls or an equalizer.
__label__1 this is the best radio app ever sure beats having to use my traditional bulky radio. you can even stream to different countries. best radio app EVER
__label__1 With this app you can listen to any radio station in any country in any part of the world. I was born and raised in NY and now live in FL and I hate FL radio, but w/ this app, I can listen to my favorite stations in NYC. I'm so happy!!!
__label__1 I've seen some negative reviews for this recent update in other places. I updated it none the less. I like to judge for myself. One big critique was about the addition to add social media - Facebook and sharing what you listen to. I see nothing wrong wit
__label__1 i love how it picks up my local stations and so many more. like how it has the categories too
__label__1 Radio from around the planet, searchable, fav-able, and record-able! Found exactly what I was looking for, then found a wealth to discover. I could not be happier.
__label__1 I like this radio app better than the heavily advertised competitor. A note to those one star reviewers who are upset that the app won't install; it is fixed now so at least have the decency to change your review.
__label__1 I have this app on my tablet and couldn't ask for anything better.  The sounds are clear and the choice of stations is great.  I have accessed a number of podcasts from favorite offerings. I don't have a lot of time during the day for radio, so this is r
__label__0 The latest update won't install on my kindle fire HD. Very annoying. Had to reinstall the free version. Please fix!
__label__1 I love the fact I can listen to Radio stations in other parts of the world without having to be on other parts of the world.
__label__1 Better than the freebie. I really like listening to talk radio or my favorite music. It is a must have on your Fire.
__label__1 I listen to several radio stations outside of my market, and I use TuneIn radio. I love sports talk radio in Dallas and use this app to keep up on the news/hot sports opinions on my favorite Metroplex teams. Record up to an hour of audio to listen to lat
__label__0 I think it is a little more than suspicious that this app runs at startup and continues to run in the background.I don't know what the app is doing, but it certainly isn't working OT to improve its streaming; this app is not as good as it used to be.
__label__1 NOT JUST ONE BUT MANY STATIONS TO CHOOSE FROM, ITS FREE AND YOU CHOOSE YOUR OWN STATIONS. NICE FREE STATIONS AVAILABLE. GET IT ITS WORTH IT
__label__1 This app works amazingly on my Droid RAZR, has all my local radio stations plus one thats not well known, and coast to coast
__label__1 Works great.  It has LOTS of radio stations and pretty good searching facilities.I wouldn't call it a battery hog, but I use it so often, when outside doing yard work, that I ended up buying a bigger battery for my phone.  It lasted 3-4 hours before and 
__label__1 Awesome App!! Totally Worth the .99 for this Android App has lots of features,you can set preset stations and lots of other Goodies!!
__label__1 I work in Pennsylvania and I listen to my favorite radio stations from Milwaukee, WI.  I have streamed radio in the car without buffering for over an hour.  It works like a charm on WiFi or on my 3G network.
__label__1 love this app. It's so much better then the I heart radio app. will continue useing this in the future.
__label__1 its awesome I always record music because their is a music button. where u can record it and when you record it u can listen to it later even if u don't have Internet connection I use it all the time when I am in the car because it is alreaddy recorded
__label__1 The thing I like most is that I can record shows I'm listening to for later, either to share or to go over what I couldn't listen to without distractions.
__label__1 i think that if you like music sports or any other thing you can listen to then get this because it has all the games and lots of good music i myself like country and if you like new country look for jake fm
__label__1 Love to here music most of the time and this station is great.I like the oldies and the Beatles music.
__label__1 I love this app! It has a great user interface and does its job great! A must have for Android on the go.  Who doesn't want to listen to their favorite radio station every where.  I can listen to Gainesville Fl The Buzz when ever I want! And record it to
__label__1 This is a must have app for anyone. I used to have several radio music apps installed, and I swore by Slacker, but not any more. It's not radio on demand in that you can't choose the particular song or artist, but with thousands of stations to choose fro
__label__1 I have 2 different tablets One android and one Webos and 2 pc,s.This app is on all of them and it was free from amazon. It is my favorite app for entertainment.It has hundreds of stations it seems, I realy don't know for sure,I just have about a half a d
__label__1 make my own song recordings and listen to many out of market stations! fantastic app. love TuneInPro! can make my own Mp3s.
__label__1 Ive been using tune in constantly for a while now and was unaware of the pro version which records the streams.  This app truly has everything that you would want as far as radio is concerned.  The buffering times arent bad as well.  Tunein Radio has got
__label__1 Over the years I have purchased these radio apps and this one is the best.  You will not be sorry.
__label__1 Used to be my favorite radio app. Now all it keeps saying is &quot;an error occurred&quot; Shame. Hope it gets fixed.
__label__1 Much more stable than the Winamp radio I was attempting to use. I love that I can search by genre, because most of the genres I listen to aren't available where I live (for some strange reason there's no dubstep radio in Kansas). Thanks for the awesome a
__label__0 Great app that's always way out of date compared to what's available on the Google market (nee Play market). Five stars for app and usefulness but one star for always being out of date compared to Google.
__label__1 Very easy-to-use. No problem playing in the background while I am doing other stuff on my Kindle fire. I would recommend purchasing this app.
__label__1 I've been a TuneIn fan for a while now.. but now with Pro can't complain. The recording option and the 10 sec repeat is awesome ..works for me!!
__label__1 This is app is my most used app.I install this one app first and could live with this being my only app.love being able to rewind station. Paulse station to go down the road to the store get home. Unpaulse and carry on where I left off. Must have
__label__0 This is really a great little app.  It has nearly all the local AM and FM radio stations here in Nebraska, as well as NOAA weather radio and the Lincoln and Omaha police and fire departments.  Plus I can listen to radio stations in other states or even o
__label__1 I use this everyday at work to listen to my favorite morning talk radio show, Bob and Tom. Good stuff
__label__1 I was skeptical at first,  but I ended up LOVING this app. It has all of my favorite stations,  and I really love the record feature bc I can record parts of my favorite morning show that I don't want to miss. A must have app for any radio lover!
__label__1 i am able to listen to radio stations locally and in NYC, you can roam and hear radio stations from other countries. i just moved away recently and this puts me in tune with the radio station i use to hear in NYC, its nice. i recommend it to any one who 
__label__1 I like to listen to old time radio when I am working around the house or on the computer.  This program provides a good selection of a wide veriety of programing.
__label__0 I purchased this app some time ago for my first generation Kindle Fire. It worked great, but the latest version is completely unusable.Edit: Latest update seems to work perfectly again. I've changed my review to 4 stars. It's a great app, but releasing a
__label__1 I love this app!  The building I work in has crummy radio reception (too much metal and machinery) - but with this sweet little app on my Kindle - I've got my favorite radio stations available!  A really big plus - it has tons of stations available from 
__label__1 I LOVE this app. It is the Three apps I cannot live without. I love listening to radio stations fromaround the world. As of now, my current favorites are: radio Caroline from UK and Celtic Evenings from Ireland. Nice to hear accents and with no commercia
__label__1 I've had tune in radio on my devices for years now,I love being able to listen to radio stations in other states&amp; I've found a few stations that I'd rather listen to them listen to local, it definitely gives me another option besides the mp3 player. 
__label__0 Great app but as others have stated, lately, the update fails with &quot;program not installed&quot;. Always worked great in the past....hopefully fixed later.
__label__1 I always have to compare apps like this to i-tunes , and this app is better really happy with the functionality,ease of use,! I have had the app for weeks and still have not finished exploring all the unique stations and options ! Nice work ....
__label__1 Has quite a few stations to choose from. playback is generally good. I have been using this app every day since I got it a couple weeks ago.  Great deal for free but It's worth it to pay money to get this app.
__label__1 I do not have radio reception in my windowless kitchen.  With this app my Fire I can listen to all my local favorite stations.  What more can I want.  I have not yet tried to get stations in other States.
__label__0 I've loved this app for years, but today I'm uninstalling it from both my phone and Roku. There is no need for a music streaming app to read and track my contacts.
__label__1 I'm using this on my Fire 8.9 and have been very pleased with its performance. The user interface is very simple to navigate regardless if I'm browsing at random or know a specific station or podcast I want to listen to. Overall speed of performance is a
__label__1 I started with the free version but decided I wanted the ad free version later. I can listen to my local radio stations, but I tend to listen to the stations I could never find locally. Celtic music is one of my favorites. Soft ambient background music i
__label__1 This app is very easy to use.  I can listen to the radio anywhere and you can save the program to your device if you want to listen later.Carolyn
__label__1 It's all fantastic and does exactly what it is supposed to do like tune in seamlessly to all stations listed. However, when app is started, I see all categories except &amp;#34;following&amp;#34;????
__label__1 Works like a charm on my HTC Aria.I can get all our city's local HD channels, which is not possible via conventional radio.Not a bad application at all.
__label__1 I loved tune in radio so much I decided to spend a dollar to get pro. I have not been let down yet. there are some great radio stations out there, KOLA top of my list of favorites.To those that gave poor app rating because of radio broadcasters wanting r
__label__1 this is a great app. used the free version for a couple years. theres a good selection of everything here. only wish they didn't list streams that dont work with the player.dont know why you would list something that doesnt play.
__label__1 please k-love rstore the radio on this app i love that you can listen to some music on here n n
__label__1 so much better than others i have tried.  The ability to search talk radio by show, so i can catch the first hours of shows i have missed on their West Coast delay, or easily find archived shows, is just what I wanted  i have and use both on my Blackberr
__label__1 Great app for a great service. I use it all the time and recommend everyone give it a try. Well worth the time and effort.
__label__1 Im glad i found this. It has made my life better and less stressful. I can find any type of music any were. And record it if i want. Thats a great thing to have antime with ipad, tabletor even my iphone!For me this is great!
__label__1 Very nice app.  It gives me the opportunity to listen to World-Wide music and talk radio, while at the same time I can be reading a book, or playing Angry Birds, on my Kindel Fire.  The .99 cent version of this app allows you to create a list of your fav
__label__1 They have absolutely no R&B/Hip Hop stations in or around Harrisburg Pennsylvania. you have to live closer to Maryland, DC, Pittsburg or Philly to hear anything worth listening to. I was feeling deprived until I got Tunein and I can catch anything from a
__label__1 I am learning to use this device and find this and extremely helpful device on the Kindle.Thank you very much
__label__1 It works great.  I would recommend this app.  The extra money was worth it for the record function.  Good job.
__label__1 I origionally had regular tunin radio. But I am in love with the pro version, espcially since I got it on a free day
__label__1 Would be great if it had shoutcast (like xiia), but the quality is here. Besides radio it has podcasts and local police -fire. Also like recording feature for spoken word (which puts me to sleep). Easy to use UI.
__label__1 Great product; don't have to buy a radio since I downloaded this app.  Saved me money and it has all the stations i could ever want available at a touch.
__label__1 Hands down this app is great for radio locally and via the internet.  It streams remarkably well.  I have not recorded anything yet, but I have noticed that as a nice option.
__label__1 I get like every station, FM, AM, and even the NOAA weather band. I love having the weather band! And at $.99 why not?
__label__1 I wasn't even sure what this did when I tried the free version. Just try it out, it more or less makes content available whenever you want it. Really good if you're a fan if Talk Radio. A great innovative app.
__label__1 This app is well worth the cost. It functions flawlessly on my Flytouch 3 Android 2.2 tablet. If you listen to radio this app gives you a huge selection to choose from.
__label__1 This is a great app that has reinvented the radio for your Android device. It is loaded with handy features. Who hasn't listen to the radio and wished they could rewind a few seconds? This app is will do just that. The layout and organization is superb. 
__label__1 This is an outstanding radio app.  I use it all the time to listen to programs not available in my area.  I also use it to listen to sports for my home team announcers since I can't listen to them in my current city.  Highly recommended.
__label__1 Love the mix of local radio and internet only station,allowing the access of radioio, and other premium io stations.  And can't forget being able to record live streams.
__label__0 update will not work. cant use it now. kindle fire 8'9 hope it gets fixed soonwill cange review once i can use
__label__1 When my husband first recommended this ap, I didn't pay much attention. It really deserves a closer look. I love NPR and especially shows like This American Life and Snap Judgement. The ability to listen to these NPR podcasts is well worth the cost of th
__label__1 I love the selection of types of stations available and the number of stations within each type. I particularly like the music selections available.
__label__0 It wasn't worth anything as a free app. For 85 cents, I almost feel cheated. San Francisco evidently hasn't joined the parade. All I can get are reruns of last summer's radio shows, and on KGO or KSFO ("progressive" and conservative SISTER stations in th
__label__0 Have a 1st gen Kindle Fire and have used TIRP for almost 2 years with only minor problems. Basically I was more than satisfied. Since the last update, I can'tset it down for more than about 5 minutes. If I do, it starts breaking up and then stops playing
__label__0 i loved this app untill the recent update now i can not open any podcasts at all.. i can only listen to live streams.. i really wish i could listen to the podcasts again
__label__1 This is a great app. I predominantly use it to stream radio stations from around the world  while driving.When I am stuck in traffic on the highway, it gives me great pleasure to know that there is a traffic jam on the M25 counter-clockwise at Junction 2
__label__1 This is a great download can pick the music , talk or entertainment radio from local or distant stations , whish I had better internet to use more
__label__0 I don't know why this is missing from the Android version when I can do it on my iPhone. If there is a way then it's bad UI design because I can't find it easily. Without a way to add by URL, this app is useless.
__label__1 TuneIn is a must have app for Android. It is a well thought out, polished application that takes existing resources and organizes and presents them beautifully.
__label__1 great app!!! I have it on my kindle fire hdx and my smartphone moto x  and once I turn it on I can't stop listening to it, in fact I have it on most of the day and also very easy to install.  PS. very happy that I got this app and also make sure you buy 
__label__1 One of my all time favorites across both platforms. Although the new version isn't as flat as the earlier versions. Too many taps to get to playing the latest station. Love that I can record shows for later!
__label__1 This is the best radio ap in my opinion.  Wherever you go, local radio stations of all kinds are found instantly.  There is an alarm and sleep timer as well.  I use my Kindle for listening to radio and love using this ap to do it
__label__1 I had no trouble with download or installation of this app. Since, I had previously made a user id and login in the free version, I logged into the pro version and all of my settings, favorites, everything except alarm setting transferred over.  This app
__label__1 saved my radio life during the long work day. some often stations are restricted, but  there are plenty of alternatives to find.
__label__1 Terrific app for android. Internet radio from anywhere in the world.  Very clear reception and very user friendly. Highly recommend it.
__label__1 I moved away from where I grew up and my sports teams aren't broadcast on television here very often, if at all. TuneIn allows me to catch all the action easily and efficiently on my phone. It's as simple as pressing the sports option in the menu then se
__label__0 Since January... as of this writing (April 11), still not addressed or working. I'd advise trying songza or another streaming music solution at this point.
__label__1 Brilliant to be able to listen to radio from all over the world. Now I can listen to American, British and German radio all on my smartphone.
__label__1 TuneIn has done a great job at offering radio stations from all over the world. I love listening to radio from Taiwan, and then from Los Angeles when I'm traveling. My wife listens to radio from Indonesia! It's amazing what our phones can do these days, 
__label__1 This app allows me to search the world for radio stations.  I have great fun listening to a station in Antarctica and all over the world!  Can you believe there is a station near  the south pole?  It is easy to use and streams many types of music.  Well 
__label__1 I had the regular version for several months so this was a no brainer to upgrade to the pro version. The audio quality is still excellent, the viarity of radio stations available worldwide is huge.I live is Florida and enjoy listening the NY Stations. I 
__label__1 This Pro version lets me record radio when a good discussion is on (I listen to talk radio) and also great for saving a favorite song to learn about the artist.
__label__1 I use it on travel to other countries in central americaIt pick alot of radio stations from local countryGood buy
__label__1 I have found this program to be extremely helpful and useful in finding radio stations that I enjoy. It provides links to many related radio stations and it allows me to record what I'm listening to so that I can listen to it again at a later time. I am 
__label__1 I use this app daily to keep up with various talk and news programs during the workday when I can't be near a radio.  Also great for catching up on local news and information on different locales.
__label__1 I have used this app for quite a while and upgraded to Pro version.  Not sure what all the complaints are about.  It has worked great.  Once in a while you lose a signal but that's to be expected as your location changes or whatever tower you're pulling 
__label__1 I was surprised to see all the local music and talk shows around town.  Finding stations, even those outside of your local area, is easy and I found one station I used to listen to when I lived somewhere else in about ten seconds (they changed station #'
__label__1 I really like this app. I'm a fan of a lot of different types of music, and this app tunes right in.
__label__1 I used the free version of this app for over a year. Then I heard that you could set TuneIn as your alarm on the paid version so I downloaded it. I've had it for a month and just now figured out how to use the alarm feature. I would have given it 3 stars
__label__1 I'm not a big radio person but this app may change my mind. It runs great on my Moto Defy and has a pretty friendly UI. The stations are streamed over the net so you'll get a ton of stations that you won't find on your car's radio whilst cruising down yo
__label__1 I love being able to record my favorite radio station when I want, and the devs used one of my requests!I emailed them 2 months ago asking them to make the playback easier to control by increasing the size of the control ball.  They emailed me back promp
__label__1 I like to listen to my radio stations whenever I go over my email on my tablet. This is nice, and I can even listen while I surf the web, too.
__label__1 This has a lot of options I haven't even gotten too yet, have only had it since this morning but enjoyed some really old songs from a man that my hubby said use to go with Bob Hope to entertain our men over seas. I love it and know it will be something I
__label__0 Why does this app need to run @ start up? I know this app for sure doesn't need access to my contacts! It's a streaming radio app.. was going to reinstall but after reading the permissions I'll pass without a doubt...
__label__1 I love this application.  I can now log in with my desktop computer and create my favorites folder.  It also allows you to move favorites between folders.  The only thing I wish they would upgrade is the ability to change the order of the folders.  Minor
__label__1 I love this app. I use it all the time to listen to my local sports teams. I also like the ability to find new stations based on genre. This is a must have app.
__label__0 Need to fix update. I cant even find the app to uninstall it. Must fix asap. I dont even want the piece of $hi$ but Cant get rid of it. If there was a rating lower than one, that would be it. Things like this really ruin the credibility of a development 
__label__1 Haven't had any problems with this app whatsoever. The only complaint (minor) is that some of the functionality is pretty hidden -  for example to access the timer, etc.
__label__0 At first this app seemed like a good idea. Listen to the radio. But this app never just plays a stream. It is always just saying stream ended after a few minutes. Why would I choose to like this app. I have yet to find a radio app that does not do this.
__label__1 ...until I downloaded it.I was surprised to find, quite literally, EVERY local station that I am even remotely interested in is on there, including an AM station that barely comes in on my actual radios that is the only one near me that does ESPN Radio.T
__label__0 this was a great app until stations started blocking their streams. now, TuneIn Radio Pro just takes up space on my phone.  totally useless.
__label__0 As of 1/05/12 the Android Market has this at version 5.3. This app is still stuck at 5.2 here on Amazon. Amazon needs to force developers to keep their apps up to date here!
__label__1 I love this app it has everything! talk, rock, news everything! unlike I heart radio your NOT limited to stations owned by just one media conglomerate. you can browse a wide variety of programming. its worth the one time fee cuz it's ONE TIME not ongoing
__label__1 I love this app.  Works smoothly on my Droid Incredible with CM7.  I love listening to my favorite stations from home when I'm on the road.  Who needs Sirius?  Not me.
__label__1 works just great. on Xoom.  You can get local and nationwide stations.  Also lets you know what's. being played.  Album art would look great on the Xoom.  And this fills the Xoom screen rather. than running in a tiny window.
__label__1 Intuitive and simple to use.  I've used the free version for a long time and now  purchased the Pro version.  Love it, thanks Amazon.
__label__1 Put a band name in search & TuneIn will show you any stations that are playing that band in real time!!You can pause & rewind the music up to 30 minutes,has a 10 second rewind,you can record music & schedule recordings,works in standby saving battery.2 t
__label__1 I've been using the free version of this app for the longest time now, and found the pro version here when Amazon had it as the daily featured app.  It's the best streaming radio app I have found so far, and the only one that has the one station I actual
__label__1 This app is great. Not only can I listen to radio stations across the country but I can also search for specific talk shows and it will give me a list of stations that are currently playing them.
__label__1 I love this app! Its almost a miracle how I can tune in to radio stations from around the world, and also select the genre I want ot listen to. Great!
__label__1 I listen to music every night and I love this app. I use it to find new stations and music.
__label__1 TuneIn Radio Pro is awesome! I live in an area that has poor radio reception, but with TuneIn I can listen to local stations, or whatever genre I want. The controls are very easy to navigate and the sort and search functions are fantastic. I use this app
__label__1 awesome. nlce to not have to wear headset.  by favorite station can always be with me.offered as a free app today. I would had gladly paid for it.  very good radio app
__label__1 This is one of my favorite apps!  I can set my own stations and listen to whatever i'm in the mood for -rock, country,r& b.  Love it...
__label__1 Intuitive UI. Stations are properly organized. I can even find Hong Kong radio shows to stream! International streaming can be choppy once in a while, but it's way better than none!Highly recommended.- myTouch 4G
__label__1 I am really glad I got it. I has everything! I even have scanner stations, & NOAA. I love it! I got all kinds of stations I set to my favorites. Pick your style, even Disco! I like many different types of music so it is perfect for me. You can even recor
__label__1 There are so many stations in every genre you can imagine. There are music and talk stations from around the world or around the corner. Most, if not all of this is available on the net, but no where near this convenient. I love both Slacker and Pandora 
__label__1 I travel a lot and this helps long drives bearable. Especially AM stations where you normally do not get clear reception, they are crystal clear on this app. Soo much to choose from.  Ability to record streaming audio.  Add favorite stations.  Search sho
__label__1 We are really enjoying the endless choices of music on our Kindle!  We are living out of the country for the winter and this is the perfect way to hear the music that you like anywhere in the world.
__label__1 this is a great app! the radio stations where i live just suck so i use this all the time, when i'm just hanging out at home or in my car. can't live without it now!
__label__1 But then I got to setting up all the nice stations I enjoy. This is very nice app for my Kindle. Very surprised at just how great this can be.
__label__1 I love this app! Its feature to search for local stations made finding these stations easy, better app than the XiiaLive Pro I tried. Its seach engine found "Celtic" stations that were missed by the XiiaLive Pro app.  I found that the layout was very eas
__label__1 I love listening to WBLW and it is a northern Michigan radio station. I live in south/west Michigan and this does not come in on my radio. So the only way to get it is on internet. This allows me to listen to this station on my Kindle.
__label__1 I had the free version of this and used it for a year and really liked it. I got a new android tablet and decided to get the paid version (only $.99 so a great bargain). There is such a good variety of radio stations with this app and It doesn't stop aft
__label__1 So many stations to choose from. There are also a few podcasts available. So much handier to have this instead of that giant boom box, although those look sweet on your shoulder. Ha
__label__1 i enjoy this program and its free what a value i know if it wasnt free its very cheap and affordable good job great.
__label__1 Although I've only tried a few music apps this one seems to work the best for what I need and like, with lots of choices in music, and genres, has not caused me any problems on my phone like the few others I've tried. Glad I got the pro even though the f
__label__1 love it. you could put sattelite radio almost out of business. too bad my kindle only has wifi and my phone is dumber than me if that is possible.
__label__1 This is perfect for me. I love listening to radio from all over the world and also finding just about any type of music you could ever want.
__label__1 A lot of channels to choose from. You are able to save your favorite songs and channels. Also you can buy songs from the app.
__label__1 Love this app. I can listen to whatever I fancy. From Classical to Rock and everything in between. You can go to any country and discover new and innovative music. I listen to soul music from outside the USA.  I now like Bluegrass.  I listen to my favori
__label__1 No more having to put on headphones for an antenna! Plus, being able to select by city, genre, etc is way cool.
__label__0 fix the recent update. it crashes the player. it idiots can't seem to leave it alone. fix this junk. NOW!!!!!!!!!!!
__label__1 I liked the free one, but this one certianly has a few features that just fill the program out if you will.  Very nice, I may start using Pandora less :-)
__label__1 I love this app it works great if you are trying to find international stations.  It is worth the money. it is easy to use and find what you want.  The car app keeps the phone from sleeping while you are driving and allows you to change stations pretty e
__label__1 Throw out that old FM/AM radio you have because TuneIn has so much more to offer. There are so many stations from which to choose even from around the world, where ever you are. I think apps are connecting us to the world like never before, and this help
__label__1 I love this app on my old Toshiba Thrive tablet.  Tune in, turn up, and flop out; they have the ambient and new world music stations  that i like, all the Soma Fm stations i rave for; with a full-bodied 320kps stream from the stations that support it, pu
__label__0 Ui is now horrible.  App want access to contacts and my accounts - information it has no valid reason to access.  Uninstalled and now looking for a streaming app which actually places priority on streaming instead of accessing personal infomation.
__label__1 It buffers a lot on my phone, but works great on the Kindle Fire! I haven't had any interruptions thus far. Not saying it wont, It just works much better for me on the Kindle Fire then on my Droid X!!
__label__1 I love this because I can tune in to the local police channel, too. I work at a hospital so knowing when there is going to be an ambulance arriving at our door helps me know when I need to see if the nursing staff needs assistance with phones, etc.
__label__1 new kindle fire User and this app is the greatest has all my south Jersey and Phila stations plus police and fire
__label__1 I love this app, one I think you should have in your collection. You can listen to a wide range of radio stations from local, national, and international sources. You can create your list of favorites. I have found stations in Spanish from my country. Yo
__label__1 Im really happy I got this app after finding Radio Nintendo and Final Fantasy radio which I listen too on a daily basis getting a dosage of the gaming nostalgia. I also occasionally will try too find 1 of Mark Levin's podcasts here and then I just love h
__label__1 I've tried several Internet radio streaming apps and this is by far the best one.  I really love how you're able to record live streams to your device so you can listen to them over again.
__label__1 I love this app; I can listen to any radio station from all over the world. I love to listen to this wherever I am. It's easy to use and the quality is superb
__label__1 This is a great app. I can get any and all stations. It is a little complicated to program and set up, but I am still working on it. Windows 8 is a pain to, but I'll eventually master it, just like the VCR
__label__1 Whenever other family members are not hogging the bandwidth, I can listen to radio from all over the globe.Radio stations and programs are easy to find in this app.  The streams are very steady and not choppy at all.The perfect app for anyone interested 
__label__1 Walkman was the best music players with built-in radio in the late 80' .  TuneIn Radio Pro allows complete control what you want to listen to @ your thumb or finger.
__label__0 Too many stations are not available on this tuner. I don't know if there is that much difference between this and the free version.
__label__1 I enjoy listening to all my favorite radio stations.  It works well with my kindle The sound is clear. I love it.
__label__1 There is a plethora of good, old-school country stations on TuneIn.  It is disappointing to see that your favorite radio station has the same playlist as every other station in the same genre due to the network.  Kind of like Clear Channel Radio.
__label__1 For those who are saying update is broke, uninstall your current version than install updated version. Works great,  no problems.
__label__1 I previously purchased this app for my iPhone.  It's my best music app, hands down and I own a few of them.  This app has worked flawlessly on my Kindle, and as of yet have not encountered any problems whatsoever.  This developer cares about this app.  T
__label__1 I live in an area where finding a good radio station is somewhat of a chore. This product works very well and is very easy to use.
__label__1 Love to listen to NPR with this I have all of the broadcast, and an occasional late 60's  70's rock music (flashbacks)
__label__1 Better then all the free one's.It's got more stations a lot more then the free bee's.  Listen to your hometown station and around the world.  Love to listen to the Christmas stations that also are from around the globe.  Worth every penny!
__label__1 Are you kidding me?  This is worth the $4.99 and is infinitely better than the free version.  The world's radio stations in the palm of your hand without having to go through your browser.  Out of 100 stations I tried, only one didn't stream -- and I bla
__label__1 Living in San Diego and occasionally homesick for my native Toronto I was able to find my fave rock station, Q107, now I can listen to a little bit of home whenever I want. Highly recommend this app!
__label__1 It's fun finding radio stations from all over the world.  My father lives across the state, and sometimes sings solos in church, which is broadcast on the local radio station, so it's nice to be able to get that radio station on Tunein and hear him sing 
__label__1 It is one of mu favorite appsI can listen to thousands of radio stations from all over the worldIt also lets me record music that I can play when not connected
__label__0 UPDATE: I guess we now know why TuneIn Radio Pro (paid version) is tracking your location: NOTIFICATION SPAM ADVERTISING!  Do you really want to pay for ads?Original review:Sure, it works as advertised, but why does this need to receive unrequested data 
__label__1 This is one of the must have apps for your Kindle.  Listen to all kinds of radio stations and more options than the other combined.  I use it daily.
__label__1 I am loving this app! UI is simple, functional and stylish. True to broadcast,  without added advertising inserts. Awesome selection of stations, with easy browse and search functions. He stations where available..  incredible sound quality. Samsung Epic
__label__1 nice to be able to hear local radio when i'm not near one. plus can get local police scanner as well!
__label__1 Very good app only I want one more thing more stability... Sometimes braking when I listening it in my car ...
__label__1 After downloading the free version of TuneIn Radio I was very impressed, and decided to buy the Pro version. The only difference that I can see is the ability to record streams for later viewing, but for the price point I don't mind in the slightest as t
__label__1 had the free version from the android market and loved it so the free pro was a no brainer.only complaint is it needs the save to sd option. thanks.
__label__1 I love being able to hear stations from the US but I was like WOW when I could find stations from the Caribbean and my Country Dominica as well ! Great app ! No complaints !
__label__1 I listen to talk radio all day.  most is on the am band and picks up static.  with this app I can listen to my favorite shows pretty much any time.  I love this app.  I can even put my kindle to sleep and the radio will continue to play.  I can listen an
__label__1 You can literally listen to any station I could think of. I listen to electronic music mostly and I've found everything from ties to to my local djs radio show. Have this program on my smart, my phone, and my kindle fire he. Pro version you can record li
__label__1 This is one app I use constantly. If I'm out of town or can't get a good signal in the office, TuneIn is there. I also love all the search features especially since I'm a talk radio addict.
__label__1 Not being a techie I wasn't sure how a radio app would work.  I LOVE IT.  I can listen to my local stations & so much more.  I was surprised to even be able to hear local police & fire bans.
__label__1 Music is a big part of my life and far more important to me than playing games on my Android. I have been a fan of Tune-In Radio for nearly the entire time I have been an Android user. When I picked up an iPod Touch back around Christmas time, I was deli
__label__0 This was great initially until it told me to install an update but each time I try it says update fail .... Now it won't work at all. Not happy.
__label__1 I moved and couldn't listen to my fav radio station anymore, but tune in allows me to listen once again.
__label__1 Wow i was able to find all my favorite stations from L.A. to San Francisco stations, even the phoenix stations,play a lot of my favorite music, also found some good comedy staions, etc. i just love it
__label__1 This app is amazing and a must-have for music lovers. I can listen to my favorite Hawai'ian music stations (yes!) no matter where I am. It stores everything you've set, even if you uninstall it for awhile. I am very happy with it.
__label__1 I love this app! I tried the free version and loved it but after trying the paid version and using the record function I have an even greater love for this app. Very worth it!
__label__1 This is truly a wonderful app. Not everything has been perfect, but it works well otherwise. There are so many stations you can add to your presets and I really am glad to be able to listen to stations worldwide which is why I got this in the first place
__label__0 I have enjoyed Pro version for years and can tolerate the new interface, but I'm not updating with the new permissions. Why does a radio app need access to my personal contacts? I'll start looking elsewhere for streamed radio content, really disappointed
__label__1 this is a fun app.  just does the trick if you wish to play it in private enjoy some great music stations.  you can also select your favorite stations for later usage.  i will recommend this since i am keeping this free app.
__label__1 I find this app very useful for listening to various online programs, able to set up favorites so can reach them quickly, the quality of the audio is excellent and available programmings are wonderful
__label__1 This has to be my favorite app.  So easy to use.  Why bother with a satellite radio subscription when you can have access to tons of free programming.  Absolutely no issues with the app.!
__label__1 people are saying that you cant update this app but just uninstall it and reinstall it and it works perfect.
__label__1 Fantastic app! I can listen to home stations anywhere! I can try out other stations from anywhere else. I'll say it again...Worth twice the price!
__label__1 this app is so amazing. i love being able to stream kexp at any tme i want. it has song and program schedule information. i got it for free but if i knew how good it was id pay the money anyways.
__label__1 TuneIn Radio Pro is amazing! It has songs that I can get at my fingertips. I can even save and record for later. I am so pleased with TuneIn Radio Pro ... if you like anything from Ambient to Trance, from Dance to Oldies, from Children's - Christmas musi
__label__1 This is one very useful app. When distant stations, especially on the am band, must reduce their wattage to comply with FCC regulations, this app replaces the computer as the only practical way to listen to these local stations.  This alone makes this de
__label__1 This is hands down the best streamer for local stations across the country. it has 90percent of the stations I search for. thanks!! nothing really tops it besides pandora.
__label__1 The number of radio stations available on this app are mind bogging!  The pro app, as of 2/26, is working and installing with no problem.  The differance in the pro is you can record shows, which I wanted to do, and works well. Save your money on all tho
__label__1 Although it's missing Clear Channel's stations and CBS still doesn't put their music stations on here, this is still the best radio streaming app for Android.  The sound quality/stream is user selectable for optimum quality, the global selection is wonde
__label__1 I have some of the same issues as others, occasionally it drops the station, perhaps this is more related to the quality of the stream or the wi-fi or 3g/4g networks. I do not believe it to be the fault of the app, as I see it occur with other similar ap
__label__1 this is better than the lite obviously and I especially like how there is re runs of any kind of news, there is so many radio stations and the best part, its only 50&cent;.  I have I heart radio but only for one reason.  the Elvis Durand show.  I'm never
__label__1 Very polished, smooth and responsive. The ability to record stations for later playback later is probably one of the best features.
__label__0 I Hate This App. Just Hate. &gt;____&lt; Its My Opinion... You Peaple Dont Get All Pee Pee Hearted Eather. xP
__label__1 Excellent radio app.  I either use this or Pandora for all of my music needs.  Each one has its own pluses and minuses, so it really rounds out your options.
__label__1 This is a great application. You can find all your favorite stations and then some. It was a free download from Amazon which makes it even better.
__label__1 I can listen to the type of music my mood dictates at any given time. It is real handy at work.
__label__1 A free promo, glad I got it. This is a pretty good app and you cant beat the price. Thanks!
__label__1 It's perfect for listening to your local radio and any other internet radio you want, and just $0.99 for no adds and more battery life. 'Nuff said.
__label__1 Awesome app and they are responsive too. It's always a pleasure to use this app when I need to travel. Sometimes you wonder why a flight takes longer than other times, well you can see why by looking it up on the map. Excellent.
__label__1 Hands down, this is the best flight tracking program I've seen. I love being able to see where the plane is at a given time on a map and getting notifications of delays, etc. In addition, my wife is a flight attendant and this app allows us to keep our s
__label__1 I got this app alongside Flightboard. This app gives you details of each flight, including where the flight is, status, estimated arrival and departure - all the stuff you'd normally you'd find in other websites. But this app gives it to you in a nice lo
__label__1 I tried some free flight apps but none compare to the info this app gives. Especially great is the inclusion of flight time and layover durations. This is very helpful when flying over different time zones. I'm off to Europe next week and anxious to out 
__label__1 Its great and fun. Great to pass time bored or just want a challenge. I use this on both my kindle and cell. I like that its free and its visually appealing.
__label__1 AI has been showing very good quality games and this one is no exception, I have enjoyed it and is excellent company for dead time.
__label__1 It is hard to find as Sudoku that works and allows notes. I can think of a lot of features I like to come out. The biggest being having the ability to add puzzles.
__label__1 I tried 3 other apps but this one seems to be the one i like most. Never crashes, it has a bunch of different sudoku to solve, and it doesnt tell you your mistake until you notice it later on when you cant keep going with it anymore.
__label__1 I like math games and this one is great to get the cerebral processes flowing.  I find it challenging. A+
__label__1 This is the best free sudoku app out there! I am definitely NOT tech savvy but this particular sudoku is so easy to learn, play &amp; master! Thanks Al Factory Limited!
__label__1 I had never played Sudoku. I took a tutorial on YouTube and got busy with this ap.There is 1 feature I wish it had that the Google Play version has, and that is to highlight all the same number (such as if you're working on 3, all the 3s turn a different
__label__1 I'm a Sudoku addict, and this is an excellent version, especially for free!  I play it every night as a relaxer.
__label__1 I've had this app for a while now and it's just awesome. I really enjoy playing and relaxing when I get home from work and there are so many puzzles to choose from its great.
__label__1 If you like Sudoku, then this is exactly what you want for your Kindle Fire.  It's Free-Ninety-free so just try it out.  The ads are VERY non-intrusive.
__label__0 Wife didn't like it - what else can I say.  Wife didn't like it - what else can I say.
__label__1 Really good game. The numbers are not too small and it is really easy to use. Anyone who enjoys Sudoku will like this game. You can change the difficulty levels.
__label__1 I love this app. It is great to be able to do sudoku without having to erase mistakes. Very easy to use.
__label__1 This is an addicting game.  I love that you can put multiple numbers in a box just like on paper.
__label__1 This is the perfect game for those who like logic puzzles. I especially like that there are 5 levels each becoming progressively more difficult and that there are hundreds of games in each level. This makes it easy to begin at a challenging level or star
__label__1 This is a great game considering that it is for free. I have been playing Sudoku on my phone for years, so I very particular about the apperance and functionability.
__label__1 This is an excellent app. I love Sudoku and tried several apps. Other apps would say certain ones are easy or medium, but were actually hard or impossible. I am pretty good at the game but I have spent hours just trying to solve one puzzle. Not with this
__label__1 Great Sudoku game. It is even compatible with my old tablet running Android 2.2.1.I would recommend it as well as other AI Factory Limited games.
__label__1 best sudoku app I've ever used! great graphics - lots of levels - good interface - I really like this sudoku app. much better than others I've tried. I highly recommend it.
__label__1 I have played through to about half way through the &#34;hard&#34; category&#34;.  It is especially good to have on my tablet for waiting rooms since it can be played without concern about interuptions or distractions.
__label__1 I love Sudoku , but I love the levels, and the brain work , there is 300 games per level and 4 levels so lots of fun games to come
__label__1 Loads quickly.  Love the ability to enter multiple numbers into a square. Plenty of puzzles at a variety of difficulty levels.
__label__1 This app rocks! Improves your brain power with each puzzle. Concentration, memory and attention span are boosted with each game. Users of all ages can benefit while learning and using this.
__label__1 Great, once you figure out how to use it.  It would be nice if it had a &#34;clear&#34; button to return to the beginning.
__label__1 this Sudoku has the option of saving more than one number per box, sorta like when you write it in pencil so you don't have to think later, just delete the one you don't want afterall.  or you can turn this option off for more of a challenge.  great game
__label__1 This free app has all of the features you need to play Sudoku. The only limitation is that there are only 300 each of the different difficulty levels. Fortunately, by the time I get through all 300, I can start at the beginning again because I have total
__label__1 I enjoy crossword puzzles, and sudoku is very entertaining. I like the way one may increase the size and difficulty of each puzzle. This is a great free app.
__label__1 This one even highlights the same number in other squares and if you bump the wrong letter and it is an invalid option, it lets you know. You can shut off that hinting feature too. but I don't use it for cheating, just to catch when I have a fat finger. 
__label__1 nothing fancy...there are ads during game play but they are not intrusive (and keep the game free).  AI also has other great games like Checkers and Reversi which link to free downloads from Sudoku.  This is one of the better Sudoku games with clean grap
__label__1 This has to be the most user friendly version I have ever used, love it, clear, large on kindle fire, so many games. Doesn't need any explanation, fantastic
__label__1 So many Sudoku apps but so few to enjoy like I do this app. Every app I have played from AI is very interactive and enjoyable. You need to get this app if you like Sudoku because you will not be disappointed.
__label__1 I love this game and the many boards that come with it, love it.The only thing I would add is more, more, more.
__label__1 Fun game for single player. Lots of puzzles to choose from to test your skill. Very user friendly version. Highly recommend
__label__1 I am enjoying this game, as it keeps my mind challenged, which is something I need... I am having great fun with this game and certainly recommend it.
__label__1 Colros and game graphics are awesome. I play this all the time. Allows notes as well! MUST HAVE in Kindle library if you like Sudoku!
__label__1 This is by far the best sudoku app on the kindle fire. Very user friendly, 1500 puzzles, and easy note taking.
__label__1 Best app yet.  It's a brain twister and concentration is key.  As u move through the puzzles your concentration and memory seems to improve.  Also just a time wasting, all around good time.
__label__1 I've been playing the Free version of Sudoku for about a week now. It works great and I'm very pleased with it. Would definitely recommend this game...especially since it's Free.
__label__1 Runs from "brain-dead" to "diabolical". Allows you to write little numbers in the squares. Lifetime supply of games. It's there when I need it.
__label__1 ...you will like this free game!  Lots of challenge...works well on my Kindle Fire...fun to play! I can definitely recommend this and many other AI Factory games!
__label__1 I like this game, even though I'm not really good at it. It gives you the option of what level you want to play, which is great for me!
__label__1 Since I have my Kindle Fire with all the Sudoko apps, I don't have to carry my Sudoku paper books to the doctor appointments, etc.  Sudoku Free is lots of fun and stimulating.
__label__1 I'm just getting into playing Sudoku and this app is very helpful to learn with.If you love Sudoku you'll love this app!
__label__1 This Sudoku is one of my favorites.  It allows multiple numbers in each square which is like taking notes.  My strategies for paper and pencil Sudoku puzzles work well with this version.
__label__1 I have tried multiple Sudoku Apps on multiple devices and I like this one the best!  It is very user friendly.
__label__1 First of all, free is always good.  Love the amount of puzzles and the different levels of difficulty this app provides.
__label__1 It is perfect that you can always work with pencil mode. Then when you have enough solved you can quickly (just a tap or two) clear your pencil marks to leave the correct number. Play this at least once a day.
__label__1 This is a free download of a commonly enjoyed game. You can select the level desired and it is a useful AP for a waiting room.
__label__1 I love this puzzle game of logic and you do not have to be a math quiz to do it, just be able to recognize the patterns.
__label__1 I never understood Sudoku before, this app makes it so easy because it lets you enter different possible numbers in each space that way you can narrow down your number choices.
__label__1 I love that i can put what numbers im guessing on the boxes. Its an amazing game and this app makes it very enjoyable!!!!!!
__label__1 Different, took a little while to figure out, but have enjoyed playing on my IPhone, cool game to play with grandkids !!
__label__1 I like this challenge this provides and I like competing with myself to try to better my times.  Excellent game!

__label__1 This sudoku app has plenty of options to make the games easier or harder (show matching numbers, clashing numbers, etc). The ads are a tiny bar at the top that I find easy to ignore. Like all games from this developer, there are no issues with the permis
__label__1 Basic sudoku.  Doesn't need internet to run which is my beef with some of the other versions.  It works for me.
__label__1 Love being able to turn the clues on and off. Better than a paper and pencil approach. The only way to occupy your time on a plane.
__label__1 I love the challenge of this game and for the most part know that every time I open it I will be challenged and usally will be successful in meeting that challenge.  I hate for a computer to beat me so this one is great as I will only beat myself.
__label__1 SUDOKU IS A VERY CHALLENGING PUZZLE. MY DAUGHTER GAVE ME A PUZZLE BOOK BUT I THINK THIS SUDOKU GAME IS THE GREATEST.
__label__1 My wife got me hooked on this game.  I have tried 3 or 4 other versions but keep returning to this one.  It is clean and simple, the way games should be.  Audio is non-intrusive, easy to put in notes, and the color scheme really starts to grow on ya.
__label__1 I am addicted to this game.  I have a love/hate relationship with the fact that is doesn't let you cheat.  Or if it does I can't figure out how.  I play it all the time.
__label__1 I've done Sudoku on paper for years and got to where I didn't enjoy it any more.  This digital version is such fun and gives so many different levels of difficulty.  I have been working on them since Christmas and still have not run out of new versions. 
__label__1 works real will and enjoy playing, better than working in paper book, thanks Al Factory Limited for great games, I have several games app from al Factory limited

__label__1 I can't tell you how happy I was to get this APP.  However, I didn't like having to pay for the translation I preferred (Yusuf Ali), but it was worth it.  Many times I'm able to listen to the Qur'an while driving long distances.  It's very comforting.  I

__label__1 I  love this application.  It has helped me a lot.  This is my favorite application.  Audio,  repetition,  which helps in memorization and meaning. What more can one ask for?

__label__1 I'm still getting used to this app but so far I am quite pleased with its straight forward intuitive ease of use. In addition to learning the news this is an excellent language learning resource. There is a translation option included via the option key

__label__1 I am a news junkie and really enjoy the selection of sorces for my vice.  I just enjoy surfing through the stories and must limit my time with this app or I would never get anything else done.  If you like reading the news you will love this app.  My goo
__label__1 This is assume, you can read any news from any state.  I actually got to read what was going on back home.
__label__1 This is a great little app that comes in handy when a global news event comes up. You can pull up the country the event happens in, pull up local paper websites and read from the local sources. The app supports saving favorites if there are some papers y
__label__1 You can have news from where you want, and you can even search the internet without actually going on the internet!
__label__1 Way! Browsing news is necessary and fun for me -- work and play -- and this app facilitates and entertains with no problems, so far, on my Pantech Element tablet. I can remove a few app icons if this keeps working so well and I switch to using it most of
__label__1 thanks to the devs for the free-ness of this. consolidates lots of papers from around the world. looks great on my kindle fire.
__label__1 People who know me: know &quot;I love great news&quot;, and I feel so far there are only 11 &quot;must have apps&quot; out there, this is that 11th!!. I love this apps news and how solid it is, but most of all, it's options for today, there perfect!. I w

__label__1 This app is great.  I enjoy using this to get free news resources.  My go to for information.  Keep up the good work.
__label__1 I found links to all the papers I like to read.  I have about 10 - a mix of large papers, my hometown and college town papers, and a few Asian papers I enjoy reading.  Now I can just go to one spot and read them all from here. Thanks!

__label__1 I like magazine reading and this app does it well. Nice selection...I hope the list grows. It would be nice to add areader view or text only view with larger font.
__label__1 Great app Im able to look through my local classifieds in minutes! very easy to find the paper you're looking for by city or title.
__label__1 I have made this my primary source of reading news.... excellent way to read many local papers from within the app from around the country or around the World. Very easy to navigate to find newspapers of interest by categorizing locations.
__label__1 This app is better than most paper's own custom apps for viewing on-line newspapers. And it is both fun and productive to find new favorites, say for vacations or trips. Search the world and find a newspaper. Thanks!
__label__1 was looking fo something like this my whole life,  yes as a kid I wanted to read about the local cattle news in Holland... lovely app
__label__1 This is invaluable to anyone who wants to be informed beyond their local stream media sources.Read the news from all over the world and decide for yourself instead of just believing what your local media people tell you.
__label__1 Wonderful app.  Im able to get local websites I couldnt access before  on my Kindle.  Apps like Washington Post Mobile work here but not on thier own.
__label__1 This is a very interesting app.  All the news you want all in one place.  This is a must have for anyone who loves to read newspapers from everywhere.
__label__1 This app works well on Kindle Fire. Keep up with the world for free. Get it and enjoy the state of the planet.
__label__1 This is, by far, the best newspaper app I have ever seen.  Every paper that you could ever want, including your local paper.  You can even get translations of papers from other countries.  It is excellent.
__label__0 It won't open,up you fools. I mean I won't to read the news., this is why I gave it one,star. I,would have given less but out of kindness I Will give you a 1 star fool.
__label__1 It's a great app for general reading of the daily news anywhere in the world... Just select local or world news by country.
__label__0 A lot of papers not available, some want upgrade with money from you. Just like when the great ny times lists a story or two on the web and after you read them they tell you immediately that if you want to continue reading anything the print you have to 
__label__1 I was able to find my small town newspaper in there...I selected &#34;country&#34; then &#34;state&#34; and then scrolled down to find my local paper and now I can read it anywhere !!!!
__label__1 Great for quick updates and information. Various choices in many languages. Enjoy reading news and sports from a variety of sources.
__label__1 So many choices it's hard to settle for one news source. Paper after paper but be forewarned Arabic papers  are in Arabic, Spanish papers are in Spanish, Chinese papers are in Chinese etc...
__label__1 thank you for this and I also truly appreciate you not trying to track my movements like many of the other applications of this type try to do.
__label__1 I absolutely love this. I am not a fan of the American versions of foreign news, but there are a good number of foreign papers that can be translated with the in-app translator. Amazing!
__label__0 all good except being asked to review and rate the app while I am using my kindle for other things,
__label__1 I love this newspaper.  It gives me all newspapers in Philadelphia area, inquire, daily news, metro, etc. When I can't pick up a copy I just turn on my kindle. Thanks kindle fire hdx
__label__1 Fairly simple to use. Good selection of newspapers. Even has a link to the paper in the small town where I live.
__label__1 I'm American and I live in a foreign country, so this is a HUGE help when I need to convert my money to American dollars. It has an incredible variety of currencies! Ahhh this app is just so helpful!!
__label__1 This app is great. It gives real time cross rates for virtually all currency pairs from the majors to the exotics and much more. I am not surprised since this app is created by Oanda. I love it.
__label__1 Terrific little app that stays up to date and accurate (with wireless or a data plan). You can set up widgets for your trip and customize them to show more than one currency and/or more than one direction (US to Euro, Euro to US, Pounds Sterling to US). 
__label__0 I can't find the application on my Kindle and don't know how to get help.  Can you help me find it?
__label__1 This is the best kind of app -- straight forward,  just the facts,  well organized,  easily understood,  and quick to respond.  No confusing extra steps or cryptic instructions.  I plan to use it to better understand currency matters in international new
__label__1 it did everything i needed to convert pesos while on vacation- easy and simple to use and understand- very user friendly
__label__1 It has quite an extensive list of currencies. I frequently travel to South America and found the coversions for those countries to be fairly accurate.
__label__1 Great currency exchange app. Simple to use and great simple black/white contrast so conversion stands out. Pull down to choose between rate options such as bank, kiosk, atm,etc.
__label__1 i thought i could use this for down the road on seeing prices in other countries in magazines and is very easy to use and all types of currency i mean all does just what it should
__label__1 I have yet to put this app &#34;to the test&#34; while traveling, but I've &#34;played&#34; with it and it works well.  It will be an excellent travel tool.
__label__1 A must for traveling
__label__1 i find this a simple and helpful app.  i like to use it as a quick reference to use while reading books with currency i do not understand. quickly i can figure out how much $$$ they are referring to.  it would probably be a great app as well for those wh
__label__1 It is the best currency converter that I have been able to find. It has all the currencies that I have use lately
__label__1 I NEED TO BE ABLE TO QUICKLY CONVERT MONEY ON MY UPCOMING TRIP AND IT WILL BE VERY HANDY TO HAVE IT ON MY PHONE
__label__1 A must for foreign traveling.  Quick conversion from one country's currency to another wherever you might be in the world.
__label__1 I keep a currency convertor on my netbook, but this is so much faster and easier to use.  You can select favorite currencies so you don't have to always scroll through the amazingly long list of available currencies.
__label__1 Great except for one thing. It doesn't work unless you are connected to the internet. When traveling to another country you need a converter when you are not connected.
__label__1 I had no complaints at all with this.I went to Europe last month (May, 2014) and used it a lot to convert from dollars to Euros and Kroners.It was so handy and helpful.I recommend this!
__label__1 this app is so helpful overseas and i love that it updates on its own to what the conversion rate is daily!
__label__1 It is fast, user friendly, and accurate. There is an option to calculate different commission rates, too. Overall I have found it useful for figuring out exchange rates.
__label__1 No more, who knew surprises when it comes to spending money overseas. This APP quickly and easily converted all different types of foreign currency into dollars so I know at any given time (even in the frenzy of bargaining with locals for the best deals)
__label__1 I liked this game but the demo only goes so far and then you can't play any more.  I don't pay for games.
__label__1 if you love solitaire then this is the app for you!!!!!beautiful background changes &amp; card changes.the graphics are first class. it has quickly become oneof my favorite games to play.
__label__1 I found this app for my HTC Merge Android platform phone and loved it.  I told CJ and she downloaded it to her Galaxy.  We both loved it there.  Recently I was given a Kindle Fire HD and found it.I love the game.  I will say, however, we seldom play anyt
__label__1 This is definitely my favorite solitaire suite.  When I had to reset my tablet  (lost everything!) this was one of the first APPS I downloaded.  As far as I can tell it works perfectly.  Every time there is an update they provide a detailed description o
__label__1 App has a lot of variety. I especially like the tutorial for each game. I wish more apps were this indepth.
__label__1 its an awesome game and it also makes u think and have fun and sometime u need yo have fun!!!!!
__label__0 It is one of the worst game that i installed in kindle..While playing the first level only the ball was moving very fast and after few seconds showing your time is over and your score is .... . .  Their is no setting for ball to move slow.. and while pla
__label__1 A steady hand gets you though the maze. Could play for hours.Don't give up, once you figure out how it's easy.
__label__0 Generally unresponsive, jerky, and slow. Runs smoother when background is removed. Would not recommend this.. even for free. Get NEWTONIAN FALLDOWN instead.
__label__1 I love it! I..I cant put it in words of how much I love it.it is fabtabulous (fabulous) .it works amazingly on my k.fire (kindel fire)
__label__1 I love this app! its a good, addicting version of falldown. it has good graphics and really catchy music. And it is NOT slow. Trust me. Its a great game
__label__1 such a simple game but addicting!  helps my son with hand eye cordination  see how far you can go !
__label__1 great game to hone up on music skills.  my only problem is that it doesnt last long enough.  Really love it
__label__1 It has helped a lot and I continue to 'test' my music reading skills, daily.  This was an excellent find.
__label__0 I am very good with music so this app was of no use to me.  If you know music, then you know it, but this app required you to name a note with a random key and clef as fast as you can, but most of the notes (in the advanced mode) were way outside the sta
__label__1 this game was very difficult to understand, so i feel better details and instructions would make this game better for all....
__label__1 This program helps me learn notation both treble clef and the bass clef.  I like the quizzes that are available.  Really good product if you are a beginner music student.
__label__0 personally i dont get it it is stupid to me so please save your time i wish i had :(
__label__0 There are no instructions. I have no idea what to do with this. If the game refuses to offer any help I can't play it. It doesn't look like anything I've seen before so I don't need to be annoyed .
__label__0 I could not figure out how this app was supposed to work. this app is a waste of precious space. Do yourself a tabor and just don't get it.
__label__0 this game is so meaning less. what are u supposed to do? don't get this at all its stupid.no purpose at all
__label__0 I thought that it would be cool before I was playing and I played it and I did not like it at all. if you want to have a cool app do NOT pick game of life lite.
__label__1 this is not like the board game. it is SUPOSED to be different. this game is about cells and evolution. not the board game Game Of Life
__label__0 Did not do what it was suppose to uninstall ed it wanting something that is one app that will scan for viruses and malware and adware also clean coach and stop running apps that use to much of battery I just don't know what's better for my kindle cause I
__label__0 This is a very aggressive cleaner, so be careful.  Using it erased not only the cache but also the stored data in my apps including log ins and downloaded books.  Somehow, it also took my desktop screen on my Cruz android tablet back to factory settings,
__label__1 This app does what it says.  It cleans brings up a list of your cache and you can clear it with one tap.  I was surprised that Facebook kept popping up even though I do not use the app that much.
__label__1 I can say this app worked like a charm. After the purchase Amazon downloader did the rest. Now my Cache is clean and thats one problem I don't worry about any more.
__label__0 Didn't remove my virus from my kindle fire .. tried a couple times and removed program .. this cost money .. mad :(
__label__1 I use this to keep my tablet cache cleaned upIt's very easy to install and use  and i was told it's good to get rid of material you don't need any more
__label__1 I literally can't say a single bad thing about this app. It's highly intuitive, entrancing, hypnotic, beautiful, brilliant, and expertly designed. Does what it says and does it better than most of it's kind. Had I heard of it before it was a FAOTD I woul
__label__0 This app keeps crashing my phone during download. I have had to keep my wifi off otherwise it starts downloading again &amp; crashing. Tried turning phone on/off. Tried other wifi networks... crashes my phone (Samsung epic) every time. went into sprint s
__label__0 This app was anything but relaxing. The first time I turned it on I couldn't get it to stop and eventually had to force it to close through the phone settings. The music was so bad that I couldn't get it closed fast enough. I thought this would be some s
__label__1 I use this to soothe my newborn son. The music isn't great but the various soundbites help calm him. I vary the strength of various sounds to distract him. Good combos include ocean and whales or wind, rain, and thunder. Try making some sounds gradually 
__label__1 Excellent sounds, very relaxing! Couldn't be happier! So many options! My husband and I have both used this and we have also used it for our 4 month old son. Worth every penny!
__label__1 Yah, Yah, app is great. thank u amazon.but to superman75, you make my day reading your reviews. thank u for adding humor to my morning faotd routine.
__label__1 This app is loaded with presets that are great. Even better is that you have the ability to adjust each with multiple sounds, levels & mixes as well. Puts all the other's I've tried so far in the "dislike" bin. This one is my absolute favorite. I play it
__label__1 Like you, I spent the night with this app. If there's an annoying piano, I didn't find it! I put it on random and was sleeping pretty soundly right up to the moment my wife woke me up for something. :-( Did what it said it would do. No complaints here th
__label__0 They should have to pay you, for wasting your time and energy downloading this app. Awful. On a Kindle Fire and it wouldnt stop playing in background.
__label__0 Alpha waves are non-productive for sleep induction, if this app truly provides them in the first place. Also, wifi only download for something this mediocre should provide higher quality sound.
__label__1 The piano was driving me crazy but thanks to other reviews I learned how to fix that. Now I love the app. and its great that I can mix my own sounds! Works great on the Kindle Fire. I will be using this app often for relaxing....
__label__1 When I finally figured out that the pause button stopped just that darn piano and left the sound effects going, this became worth 5 stars.I'm going to try this out for real when I sleep tonight since my house is so noisy and I'm really bothered by sound 
__label__1 I have been using the iPhone version of this Sleep program (by different programmer Bonsai Labs) for over a year now. Works well for my Tinnitus.  What people have to understand this is NOT just any white noise generator or sleep app.  It actually has un
__label__1 I would have reviewed this sooner but I was catching up on some much needed sleep. Cannot beat the price.
__label__1 You can turn the piano off by pressing the pause button. I created my own lullaby from this app. I recommend it. too sleepy to write more. used on my kindle fire
__label__0 I got this as the freebie app of the day for my Kindle Fire and I am glad that I didn't pay for it. I ended up uninstalling it.You can mix sounds (rowing, paddling, rain, camp fire, splash, wind, ocean, thunder, whale song, beach, sand walking, and storm
__label__1 This app makes all kinds of relaxing sound that can help you sleep if you are into that sort of thing.
__label__0 this app is okay for free but if you cant turn it off its not really worth it.  uninstalled it right after i played with it for a few minutes
__label__1 I've been using this app for over a year now.  Started with the free edition, then when it was offered as a FAOTD, I jumped on the deluxe version.  Very simple to use and customize.  Plenty of settings to find the right combination of sounds that work fo
__label__1 Relaxed my sick crying baby as well as myself the minute it started playing, free is great but stopping a baby from crying is priceless. the only thing I would do to make this better is add color changing screens.
__label__0 I downloaded this app to see what the features were. I had it on my Kindle Fire but in the cloud. When it loaded I played every tune and mostly they are just water sounds and piano music which to me is not very relaxing. When I tried to turn is off it wo
__label__1 Not an ordinary sleep app. So many sounds and effects! The fact one can turn on or off certain sounds and save them is a big +! If I had known about this app earlier, I definitely would've bought it. Kinda glad I didn't though, since now I get it for fre
__label__1 this is one of the first FAOTD's that I would not hesitate to actually pay for. This is so relaxing and wonderful to unwind to. I cant say enough good things!!
__label__1 Very nice Sound Sleep app.  Lots of choices and has quality sound.  I would recommend this over the free sleep machine apps and over many of the paid ones.  Nice feature to have on the kindle.  Definitely worth the money.
__label__0 Few sounds, all of which have very silly, new agey names, computer generated attempts at natural noises and bad piano accompaniment. Even free, this app is a waste of money. Going back to &quot;Relax and sleep&quot;.
__label__1 It's not a huge app by any means, but it gets the job done. I hope it works and I fall asleep soon. Yup it's wor
__label__1 I have no idea what anybody has to complain about. I played around with it for 5 minutes &amp; was relaxed enough to fall asleep. There are so many customization options you're bound to find something you like. It worked incredibly well on my Droid x. No
__label__1 going thru all the sounds it seems like a pretty good app can't wait to try it tonight. all in all not a bad free app
__label__0 Ignore Supertroll and then him and his mom, who keeps posting as someone who actually thinks his stories are so funny, will go away.  Now for this so-called sleep app. I figured out how to turn off the annoying piano fairly easy. I love piano, but it is 
__label__1 thank you for this app. very enjoyable, relax, peaceful, I believe this is good therapy! it reminds about my recent vacation on a coconut beach ;)
__label__1 I have trouble sleeping sometimes so I'll occasionally use a different program for sounds (Relax and Sleep). This one definitely has a unique sound and the music options are very nice and it's easy to use. Everything the other app has, but of a higher qu
__label__0 its does not perform Luke it should. I didn't download it but since amazon let's me say what I want I say boo! bad appAmazon you need to fix this rating system, right now.
__label__0 Alpha frequencies and binaural beats for sleep is pseudoscientific nonsense. There might be a scientific effect related to binaural beats, but it requires two different carefully tuned frequencies, one sent to each ear. You're not going to get that effec
__label__1 Could not wait to turn piano off, nothing relaxing about that. Great sound choices. How realistic can it be on a phone? This one comes close...
__label__1 So its 3:30 AM eastern time and I must say this app works grea...zzz zzzz zzzzz zzzzz zz z zzzz
__label__1 My wife uses this for background noises to help her fall asleep, does the job well and she likes the selection of sounds.
__label__1 After spending last night in jail (please see updated review of yesterday's FAOTD) I was extrememly excited to see this offering today by Amazon. I really needed something to help me relax. So, I downloaded Sound Sleep Deluxe Edition and headed off to wo
__label__0 I downloaded this app .. then uninstalled it, due to the fact that it wouldn't stop playing the music. Even when I stopped the program or hit pause and exit! Not impressed.
__label__1 Okay you guys I mean seriously you guys are blind as a bay and have no recognition to how this application was designed! That scratchyness that bugs so much of you that adds to the ambient tones and I like it. I'm sure they put that in on purpose to add 
__label__1 it relaxed me and did what it says so people cant complain. pause shuts piano off. good app that i would recommend. ]|[Whitewarrior]|[
__label__1 If you are the sort of person thay loves ambient relaxing music, like I do, you will love this app. As a musician, I will tell you that the sound quality is fine... I plan on using this app often.
__label__0 My spouse and friends love this game, we play it a lot, but we play on a different app. This was a good app the first time thru, but after just one time thru, it states &#34;There is no content in the database&#34;. That's right, all truths and all dares
__label__0 Guess It was NOT what I was expecting it to be, I suppose for the younger crowd it would be more useful and playful for them but for me I can do without it!
__label__1 me and my man love this app kindle fire get this app people trust me its free u should just try it.
__label__1 OMG When I tried this it blew my mind my man and I got addicted to this we are really sexual
__label__0 i absolutely hated it becauseit is just disgustingfront cover looks grossthe only thing i kinda like is because it is free
__label__1 Not for people with a jealous partner!Be prepared to get physical with every member of the opposite sex.For those daring enough, this will get the party started.. And quickly!
__label__0 there is no removel fix that or take it off the app store hate it I thought It would be fun but it is to unapropreate stupied app and I mean it it sucks
__label__0 I was having a party and thought this would be a good game. I didn't like that you can add your own dares it just didn't make since. not a game to play if you have been drinking. we were all lost. would not recommend.
__label__1 HEY PEPS RIGHT NOWXI HAVE BIG BOOBIES CAUSE I PUMPED THEM UP SO NOW MY BOYFRIE D LOVES MY BOOBIES I AM SEXY AND I KNOW IT.
__label__1 No Android device I own will be without this awesome App. It did such a great job of helping me unclutter my Xoom homescreen that now the launcher is actually faster.
__label__1 One of the most useful android apps I have, i'd say one of top 3 for me out of 200+ I have. Absolutely great on Xoom to augment standard launcher, I sort all my apps to categories/labels and each category is easily accessible as folder view. And its widg
__label__1 Everytime I needed to search for an app on my ever increasing stockpile I would gripe about androids lack of a functional system to accomplish simple organization... not anymore! This app has changed my life and has made me love my phone again!
__label__1 Didn't get around to using it for a while, as I could see there was a bit of an initial time investment and I have quite a few apps installed.  Now that I've finally gotten everything set up, it has proven to be the best organizer I've ever used, with a 
__label__1 yes you can create folders without this, but this makes it so easy to organize your apps and contacts. you can even rename those apps you never seemto be able to find.
__label__1 Because I have added so many apps in the Appstore &quot;App of the day&quot;, I needed this app to get them organized. I setup folders by app type (fitness, games, kids, etc.). Huge improvement to my Droid desktop.
__label__1 Bought this a month ago. takes a little setup time, but works much better than dropping folders on the home screen. I like the higher density options, and like the notification to add new downloads to a folder.Oops, gave this 5 stars - must be a fake rev
__label__1 If you are looking for a fully customizable folder organizer, look no further. With FolderOrganizer you can clear up you screens and have all similar apps in one folder instead of strewn over 7 screens.Plus, with the ability to use ANY picture, icon or p
__label__1 I've tried other similar apps but this is the best. Actually, I'm not sure that I could live without it on my android. It's easy to use and the export settings feature really saved me time setting up folders again when I had to replace my phone.
__label__1 I bought this on the Android Market a long time ago. This is the best app for organizing your phone. Period. The options are almost limitless when you learn how to use it. My only complaint is there is a bit of a learning curve, but still a solid 5 star 
__label__1 if you own a tablet, you know that there are no folders on the home screens. I found a couple app substitutes and this one by far is the best one I've tried. works perfectly on Samsung galaxy tab 10.1
__label__0 Read and write contacts? Place a call through the dialer without notifying the user? Has anyone checked the permissions this folder manager requires?I use and love the app, just went to update it and read the permissions,  and am going to uninstall it.  
__label__0 Puts all your apps into one big box with no options to chose which our in which order. Imagine a box with 50 utility and game apps in a chaotic mess. The developer has a lot of nerve charging for an app in its beta stage.
__label__1 Got this when it was the FAotD and I use it all the time. I love the way you can put folders "within" folders, and give your folders icons. But what happened to the contacts? Long pressing a contact used to give you the option of contact method (call, te
__label__1 In short, this app just works.  Highly customizable and really smooth.  At this point, I'd give more than 5 stars if I could.  Well done!
__label__1 I love the plethora of features this app contains. I primarily use the folder link view that shows just a simple icon with a mini-view of the apps inside on my homescreen. If works great; organization is easy, as well. I would have definitely bought it, 
__label__1 I'm an organization freak and I have been waiting for an app like this. I hate clutter on my screens and the ability to group apps into folders is the perfect solution!
__label__1 This is the best app. It is essential to anyone who wants to be organised with their apps. I bought it over a year ago and it has never given me any trouble.  Rooted Eris
__label__1 This is an amazing app. It let's me put my Apps in folders for quick and easy access. I have the Droid original, and this really helps cover for the slow processing.
__label__1 This app is very helpful, especially if you try a lot of apps.  This is what folders should have been.  Strongly recommend
__label__1 This is a fantastic app. Well worth the cost. Organizing and accessing apps and shortcuts could not be more simple than with FolderOrganizer.I previously used a similair app that would require me to swipe from a side of the screen to access my apps. It w
__label__1 I like being able to group apps into folders that I can shortcut on my home screen. FolderOrganizer makes it much easier to add multiple apps at once to a folder (vs. using stock Android folders). Also like being able to assign custom icons. The best fea
__label__1 Simply brilliant.  This is the kind of perfection that should be how your phone is supposed to work by default.  You simply must try this app.  The setup is worth the time.  And folders are easier, faster and behave as they should.
__label__1 Folder Organizer looks and works great on my Droid X. I was a little slow on startup but viewing the YouTube video really helped. I suggest you disregard the negative reviews from ill-informed, self-appointed app-police. Their motives are not clear to me
__label__1 Very good.  I have alot of apps, and this helps me access my favorites easily by category. Even reminds to categorize when downloading new apps.
__label__0 Ever since I installed and uninstalled this marginally useful app, my phone has been acting up and no longer sends texts. Watch out for the permissions! Thanks for the malware, amazon.These fake reviews and die hard folder organizer fans are also suspici

__label__1 It's a great app.  The reason the trolls rate it with 1 star is because other people rate it with 5 stars.  How ignorant is that?  Oh, if it's a good app that people are reviewing high, those reviews must be fake, because these trolls know it all.I've us
__label__1 This is a nice app. that does everything that it says and it does those things well. I am a very organized person and this app. helps me organize my phone (Thunderbolt) the way that I have been wanting to. Permissions are for obvious reasons; internet- t
__label__1 FolderOrganizer IS counterintuitive.  It IS difficult to learn.  I DO love it!I want more icons on my home scree than than I could fit on 3 homescreens!  Ribbon launchers don't help.  They make the problem worse as I tug on the ribbon looking for the app
__label__1 This app is awesome! Makes my screen much easier to maneuver and cleaner. Plus, the dev is AWESOME at support! Always updating and ready to help if any issues! Best app on my phone!!!
__label__1 I can't believe I have never come across this app before today. I use launcherpro on my dell streak and the only thing i didn't like about it was the folder system. this app is exactly what i was looking for. easy to use and can customize folder icons an
__label__1 I picked this up as the FAotD and it&apos;s the only one so far that actually made my phone easier to use.  Initial setup takes a bit, but I went from 7 home screens to only 5 and two of them only have large widgets.  Love the custom folder icons and nes
__label__1 I have been using Fabio's apps for years now. With FolderOrganizer, he simply got everything right. I can't run an Android phone without this app. I love being able to organize my apps into categories (which many apps and luanchers can do), but the real

__label__1 The longer I use this app and learn what it can do, the more useful it becomes. My favorite feature is the "folder link". It's a folder that you can put wherever you want and you can put whatever you want inside that folder. You can mix and match apps, s

__label__1 This thing is the cream of the crop.  Almost like a custom Home Launcher but totally not one.  Use it for just about everything that you actually use an Android for, and organize it all.  Talk about streamlining an already streamlined device.This thing m
__label__0 This was one of the free a day apps and I got it. I find now I never use it and it just sits there.

__label__1 Believe it or not, this is one of the best, must have, Android apps out there.  I bought it long ago for my OG Droid 1 and am still using it on my Droid 2 Global today.  Not too sound too much like a glowing fanboy review, but it really does redefine how
__label__1 I gave this app a try without knowing Mich about it. I was pleasantly surprised at how much it did and how well it was organized. there is a bit of a learning curve, but once you get it all set the way you like then its very simple to maintain. I highly 
__label__1 Probably the best program of its kind. Well worth the money I paid. Extremely customizable and very easy to use. If you have a lot of applications this makes them easy to find. Also has great widgets and shortcuts. Definitely worth a try!
__label__1 A lot of apps seem to replicate about the same what stock apps do. I wouldn't keep an app if improvements are incrimental. This is one of the few apps that improves on the old Android organizing so well, that it becomes a keeper.
__label__1 Works great on my evo 3d gives you a lot of flexibility with your home screen and great for clearing up clutter
__label__1 I have amassed many apps, specifically games, and this app has made it easier to organize all of them. \n\nBefore this, I used folders to organize games into genres since looking in the app drawer can be tedious. For whatever reason, whenever I added a n
__label__1 I have made shortcuts of all kinds, which allows better use of applications.  The option of a variety of  sorts further organizes my evo. Folders are saved, but the truly great function is, f I designate an app, it will automatically show up in icons alr

__label__1 This app is definitely one of the first couple of apps you should install when you get a new Android phone or tablet. It completely makes everything easier, less cluttered and organized. I have been using this app since 2011 and I've never uninstalled it
__label__1 This is a great app. It never bugs out. Very well made. Very useful. I like it for keeping As much as I  can on the main home screen with minimal taps. Editing folders is so much easier with this version too.
__label__1 I have always enjoyed this app and its numerous great features for organizing my devices.  I won't restate all the great features that have been already commented, but instead will focus on the latest update to the app.As of the time of this writing (Dec

__label__1 I have an LG Optimus V and having this app really made things easier with tab space on my android. Using the folder widget makes getting my contacts and apps much more organized and easier to access. Highly, highly recommended since it's free for today.

__label__0 This app was incredible till update now theybtook away larger Widgets I have barely any use for it because they're only 4 by 1 that's so tiny on a tablet. Seriously fix it.
__label__1 better than app organizer because I can sort by last used or most used if I want to and also because i can have a folder inside another folder.
__label__1 this is a great application, it is the best I have seen at organization for all aspects of management of folder and labels.
__label__1 Bought through Android Market months ago, this has been well worth it. Customized folders and icons are great, along with the ability to put folders inside of folders. Kind of like Inception, without the dreams.
__label__1 I DL this application in July 2011 when it was the free app of the day.  I love it. I am now hoping it will work on my new phone when I get it next week. I have organized all my apps to suit my personal method of organization.  You will like it too if yo
__label__1 This is probably one of the best android apps available.  Rather than having a shortcut for each app in the launcher, I have shortcuts for each category folder.  I actually paid for this app and it was well worth the money.
__label__1 I love this application! I've been using the free version for a long time. It's extremely useful. Thank you Amazon Appstore.
__label__1 this is one of the most useful apps i have downloaded. works fantastic. i was looking for something to customize folders i made on my home screens on my droid2 and found this great app. once you create the widget on your home screen, say for games, you c
__label__1 This is a must have app,  just like ColorNote and apps2sd.  All must have apps that do a much needed job very well with a quick and simple interface.
__label__1 Forget the troll reviews ( it's a thing with Amazon app store patrons) this is one of the few apps or there worth every penny.
__label__1 This is a great app for reducing clutter on my Galaxy Tab 10.1.  Took about 5 mins to figure out, but totally worth it.  Be patient and read the info on the developer's site.
__label__1 Maybe this will help combat the idiot 1 stars. this app is listed on the Android martetplace as well.Under the paid version it has had more than 50,000 - 100,000 downloads. So NO, not a brand new app!!!!And of those people who have PAID for this app over

__label__1 and it is better than ever now.. it keeps getting better! keep up the good work dev!I am currently using this on the Kindle Fire running Go Launcher... its perfect.
__label__1 I purchased this app several weeks ago.  It is a must-have for anyone who loads a large number of apps on their phone.  I'm stunned that we're up to version 3.1 of Android and it still doesn't have built-in folder support or app labeling.  The Folder Org

__label__1 This app is sleek and very stable. (myTouch 3G Slide and G2) It is PACKED with features - the only complaint I've EVER had about this app is the lack of in-depth how-to. But you can figure out most of the functionality by playing with it. It is so packed
__label__1 This app is a wonderful way to keep all your other apps organized. Once your apps are labeled (and you can have multiple labels per app), you can make widgets on your home screen. Once you see how to use this app, all of this stuff is much easier than se
__label__1 Great app. but always seems to be a version behind what is available on Google play store. Please update it to keep in synch with the play store version.
__label__1 Folder Organizer is the most useful app I ever downloaded. It organizes your home screens, let's you rename and change icons, by using shortcuts. it gets around that HTC Sense bug of your apps inside folders turning to a basic Android icon, after a reboo

__label__1 thanks to the creaters of this app for taking the time to create it! and providing it for free! I have this on all my devices and make sure that my children do as well! sometimes we get caught up in the day to day activities but this makes sure that we c
__label__1 I love that I can read a different verse every day and really think about it.  I also love the different translations. Thank you!
__label__1 I use this all the time every day every week. it really helps with my walk in Christ my savior. it also is really easy to use you open the application and it randomly chooses a scripture in the Bible that relates to identity in Christ. also it usually al
__label__1 It's really nice to have a daily Bible verse pop up to give me something to focus on for the day.However, I frequently forget to look at the notification bar so sometimes it's later on in the day before I check. I wish there was a bit more of a notificat
__label__1 I use this app near the beginning of my prayer time.  It is so affirming to reflect on who I am in Christ.  And that reflection reminds me of who Christ is and what He has done.The app itself is simple,easy and reliable.
__label__1 Using this program is a great way to start and end my day. It helps me focus on the really important things in my life.
__label__1 I love this app! Each day the scriptures always seem to be just what I need to read on that day!!
__label__1 Helps me remember I AM A CHILD OF GOD, and the power that I have in the name of Christ.
__label__1 Any time of the day that I sign in, its right there with an encouraging word from God.  Love it.
__label__1 I like this that it comes up on my kindle every morning. I don't do any thing until a have my quiet time with my Lord.
__label__1 I read everyday but this is really nice little addition to my other apps. I will be bouncing back and forth in my games and see that I have a scripture waiting for me. Keep the Word in my head throughout. the day. I like it :-)
__label__1 as a Christian on face book I like to make myself known.this app helped me to pick a verse each day to post.it is always uplifting and engoureging every day.I love it!
__label__1 I love it you cannot beat the spreading Gods Word,it is so nice to be able to read Gods Word in the morning thanks tommy
__label__1 It is a good way to start my day every morning. I have it set to deliver a verse to my Kindle every morning. Usually a short/quick read if I am in a hurry, but gives the chapter and verse for reference if I choose to read further. Great app that I would 
__label__1 helps me get my day started in a positive and BLESSED. way I recommend. it to everyone it gives me inspiration to be my best to all I come in contact with this is a wonderful app!
__label__1 this is a great daily encouragement. just a quick read each day to give me something good to think about.
__label__0 didnt mean to get this game but i guess if u like sounds it is ok had a 4 and 6 yr old buggin me while downloaded game for them
__label__0 I did not like it because it was not really a game and who would want to hear the sound of bowling pins being knocked down
__label__0 For me the noise is accurate but just that.  Without active visuals it had no meaning for me and I got rid of it.
__label__0 My grandson put this on my Kindle---he thought I needed it.  It is very annoying.  I guess it is ok if you like that kind of thing.
__label__1 I do enjoy playing this game. It is a learning process, learn how to focus,and think and learn how we shouldManage to win,win and win.
__label__0 this is a useless app, i did not order this unless my grand kids did, but i thought that you need my password to order and they are young kids and i am the only one who know my password. took it off my kindle. sad that i was charged for it!
__label__1 my 3 year old granddaughter loves this and requested it be downloaded.  She loves the sounds and it seems to be a sensory enlightment for her.
__label__0 Cannot get it to play.  When I open the game, the pins are on both  sides. Right in the middle is a pin with the word STOP on it.No matter what pin I click on, it does not change.
__label__0 I thought it was something else.  How do I delete it?  I don't want it on my Kindle.  Please advise.
__label__0 THIS APP STINKS,I want my money back, I guess it was my fault, I thought it was a game, my bad I guess.
__label__0 I can't play it due to login messes and conflicting games.  What a pain.  Not even on my cellphone.  I can enter my user name and password and still get an &#34;invalid&#34; notice.
__label__0 I did not care for this game.  I was not very good at the rotations, so I could not get very far.
__label__0 Ironically, I have this on my BB Curve and it works fine. But I cannot get it to work at all on my Vizio tablet as some others have stated. It just will not work. It is free, however, so it might work with other tablets-just not the vizio.
__label__1 This bar-code reader works faster and more reliably than the three others I've tried. It seems to capture faster by making better use of the camera features.
__label__0 Would not work, it disabled the camera so neither one would work.  I was really looking forward to using it.
__label__1 THis is agreat little app.  It works like it should, and works on any Android 4.0 device.  Love the price (free).
__label__0 It would not find the qr code on a few  that I tried it on . it just wouldn't work.
__label__0 I want to get a barcode scanner for the Archos 70. This does not work for the antique tablet. I don't know what will work for old tablets?
__label__1 I needed this for barcode reading, but do not use it enough for a better rating, but I will now.
__label__0 you can scan a barcode and it reads it but can't seem to find it anywhere.  I have a Verizon droid
__label__1 It does work with my Acer Android tablet. Very fast scans compared to other apps. Could not get it to function with my Kindle maybe because of the front only lens makes it very hard to line up the code.
__label__1 The my scan feature saves previous scans and can save a bunch of time if you want to look at previously scanned sites.  The app works well and is stable.
__label__1 This worked for me instantly.  Better, it let me install another Android app that both Amazon and Google Market (now Google Play) insisted wouldn't run on my S5570 Galaxy Mini Android phone.  I eventually found the uncooperative app on one of the kazilli
__label__0 States that another application is reading on to the camera. Stopped all apps that read to camera and still getting the same statement. Uninstalled the app.
__label__1 I tried to use this device on a magazine code and it took me directly to that magazine's web site.  I guess that is the purpose of this app.  Maybe in the future I will find more of a use for it. Try it; it was free.
__label__0 I TRIED FOR HOURS TO MAKE IT WORK. I WENT TO A CLASS ON  HOW TO USE MY NEW ANDROID, AND THE TEACHERS COULDN'T GET IT TO WORK.
__label__1 One of my discontents with Verizon is that they talked me into buying an LG phone, rather than the Droid I came in there for. Battery life is really bad on this one, if you want to have any screen time - but this application really helps. It is amazing w
__label__1 Really like this app.  It finds all the programs running in the background better than any other task killer I have used.  Very easy to use, and effective in freeing up resources.
__label__0 It will not remove Google apps that are imbedded in a android tablet.  Downloaded apps can be uninstalled without this.
__label__1 I love having this app to close all of the running ones.  It's a must have to save battery life.  I have it on all of my android devices, can't do without it.
__label__1 A great way to kill all of the open apps on your phone or tablet that you thought you had closed.
__label__0 Slows down the android processor from my experience, it does its job however so I guess you can't really complain.
__label__1 Seems to speed up my Kindle fire when use it.  If it really saves the memory it says then it is truly worth it.
__label__1 This application does what it claims quite well & intuitively & for free. I can't think of a better compliment. Some nice features within. I must say, I've liked every app this developer has published.
__label__1 this app works nice and great, i dont like the fact that it shows amazon tasks. i like to keep those open
__label__0 click close apps, it will say it closed 46 apps. click it again it says no apps closed click it again 49 apps closed...wtf? if it closed the apps then they should be closed till you open them again. and at no time have I ever opened 49 apps on my phone a
__label__1 This app is great.  It has helped me save battery life be uninstalling programs that are constantly running in the background (like AccuWeather, Are You Smarter Than a Fifth Grader, and TED).  I'm not sure why people make apps that are always running fro
__label__1 This does exactly what it says it will do.  I find it infuriating on the Kindle Fire HD that I can't kill or even SEE an app that's running in the background, eating up my precious memory.  This app works great at not only showing you what is running, bu
__label__1 Love this little program.  Some times I don't have the energy to go find what I left open on my phone and it is bogged down.With the little greem man, I can with one click kill all of them and free up my phone again!!
__label__1 I've tried other app killers for my Kindle and this works better than any other.  It kills more apps, it is easy to use and there is no guessing what is or isn't being killed, it shows you exactly what it is killing.
__label__1 Works in reducing background stuffthat may be going on when you wantto get things done quickly. I like thegreen android man.Of course I reallyhave no trouble with my KFHD 7 butthere are some apps that take off anddo their own thing when you turn yourcomp
__label__1 No 5 star... I had to give it at least 1. This is someone's child, they worked hard on it, probally thought it was the next best thing to scrabble. Oh ya, before I forget, I didn't even download the app so sorry. No review on that aspect. Hey, have a fan
__label__1 Not sure why the bad reviews. I really liked it. Works just like regular sudoku, but with a word to find.
__label__0 Only &quot;instructions&quot; are to click on empty space in the grid, but when do so nothing happens so unable to play.
__label__1 Wordoku is a sudoku-like game that you can play in two different ways. You can play it as a Sudoku with letters instead of numbers, or you can play it with the idea of only trying to solve the 9-letter word. I enjoy Wordoku more playing it like the latte
__label__0 Can't play on my galaxy tablet, nothing shows up on the main page to start to the game. Please fix, would love to try it.
__label__0 I can see it having potential, but its really hard to remember what letters are being used, the box to choose letters covers a portion of the puzzle, making it hard to remember what letters have been used.  I can't tell what the word is supposed to be an
__label__0 Pros: Nice looking game board, runs smoothly on Motorola DroidCons: far cry from a &quot;word game&quot;, slow, no flow, overly complicated, no App2SDI rock at Sudoku, and at word games. This game just bored the crap out of me. It took too long to rememb
__label__1 I enjoyed it. It uses the same basic rules of sudoku but the object is to find the hidden word within the puzzle. Once you've found it you've beaten the level but can continue and fill it in sudoku style to completely beat the level or move onto the next
__label__0 this app froze up on the title screen the first few times I loaded it.  finally got passed the title screen only to have it freeze on the game screen.  and I can't get to any type of menu.
__label__0 Either it doesn't work on tablets or it is too hard to figure out how to start a game. Can't get past the first screen.
__label__0 My girlfriend got so frustrated playing this game she threw my phone across the room. I don't have insurance on  it, so I'm glad it didn't break, or it would have cost $700 to replace.I tried it myself thinking how bad could it be. After 5 minutes of pla
__label__0 Terrible game. I was happy to see an alternative to sodoku but this ruined it. Just play sodoku instead of this poorly executed game.
__label__0 Not like sudoku at all. Every puzzle should only have one solution. The very first Wordoku I tried was not solvable because it had multiple possible solutions.
__label__1 I remember when Sudoku first came out and it wasn't met well, then all of a sudden it became an instant classic.
__label__1 I've never been able to figure out regular Sudoku, and that made me feel dumb. I understood the logic behind it, but I could never solve even the simplest puzzle.Now I realize that I AM smart, I just don't dig numbers. Dug! Already knew that! With Wordok
__label__1 there are only a few glitches but they don't make the hours of fun and destruction any worse. I loved the original on the computer and I'm so glad its now an app.
__label__0 I was not satisfied with it, so it is no longer on my device.  It's hard to say anything else.  I just did not like it
__label__1 If you ever have a kid borrow your phone, then you should buy this app.This is a great app, and I love it for the simplicity, and how you get right into flashing through the dinosaurs. It's a super quick way to learn dinosaurs, because it hits a ton of d
__label__1 I use this on my tablet all the time. Easy to use. It gets you there fast. What more can I say.
__label__1 I had so many problems w/ google and felt like prey because of it. All I wanted was an accurate search engine w/ out ALL the ADS and more w/ the privacy. The excessive amout of google cookies were just bugging out my device and I desperately needed an al
__label__1 There's a rare moment in America now when we feel alone. I like going here for that feeling of every keystroke NOT being recorded.
__label__1 Sure you get all the privacy benefits and there's some cool features as well To search, but what I like best about this app is the stories feature. you can tailor to your  taste and its better than any kind of news feed that you can find on Yahoo or else
__label__1 Have been using DuckDuckGo for a couple years now, prefer it to being tracked all over the internet by Google.
__label__1 With the exception of DuckDuckGo, all other search engines ie, Bing, Google, Yahoo and others, all store targeted data of sites and topics you have searched.  Using the other search engines will load you up with targeted advertizing.  DuckDuckGo does not
__label__0 as much as i tried,i did not see any use for this...search sites(?) supplied with app were(to me) junk sites with novalue...got rid of it.
__label__1 A more private app that lets you check things without the invasion or needing a public file for others to track you. Do check it out on the drive engine too. It can be an alternate search engine and backup search check to get the information when you wan
__label__1 Strange name but it does what I want a search engine to do and NOTHING more.  I'd recommend DuckDuckGo to anyone.
__label__1 I have used duck duck go on my laptop for awhile now so I am sure I will like it on my tablet.
__label__1 Duckduckgo gives very good search results without the tracking. It has replaced Google as the default search engine in all my browsers. I almost didn't try it because of the name, but I'm glad I did.
__label__1 On Goggles blog they recently posted government requests for user data is on the rise, yet they are continuing to pry and require more data.  Today I went to review Duckduckgo's latest app, but Goggle now requires you create a public profile with your fi

__label__1 Great search engine that has gotten me to the best sites fir the search items. No complaints. Use it for yourself.
__label__1 No adds or pop ups just suggested links..like it for that reason.Have been satisified so far . screen not cluttered with unnecessary junk. thanks so much.
__label__1 i dont know how i ever got along with out it seriously my best friend saw i was using google/bing and after laughing at me much like i did when i heard my mom still uses IE she turned me on to the duckmiester here. Never looking back!!!!
__label__1 Easy to use. Nice knowing I can safely surf the net. Without where I go being kept track of. Works as good as any search engine.
__label__1 Love it. NO TRACKING!!! The speed is fine. I never use google any more. I do wish the browser wasn't so expanded.
__label__1 This app is a very good alternative to other search engines and took only seconds to install on my kindle fire..
__label__1 The safe alternative to Google (aka the CIA, Google it!), Yahoo and Bing. None of your information is cached (stored) by the guy who created this browser. No snooping or selling of your information like other search engines. I have been using this search
__label__1 Very pleased with using this app as home page basis. Fast connection. Various news articles and interest stories on home page. Humorous pieces and every day photos of notice are also included offerings. Beginning a search without ads in your face is a re

__label__1 This is a great app!!!! I love that it doesn't have all that advertising like other search engines and also love the fact that it doesn't track you either. Highly recommended.  AAAA++++++++
__label__1 Finally a search engine that don't give me what they think I want accordingly to my previews searches. It always give me what I need on the first page. It is like a search engine that is not bias.
__label__1 Probably the best app and search engine. Love the set up and ease of use. Very functional search tools. No need to sign in, just download and start  using.
__label__1 This engine give excellent search results, and the survey of articles from the web is very wide ranging and of high quality.
__label__1 Love DuckDuckGo,it is so easy to use and  I enjoy using knowing I'm not being tracked! Nice to have this little bit of privacy!
__label__1 I use DuckDuckGo on my laptop and was so happy to find it available for use on my tablet!  You do not get all the ads, you search anonymously, they don't keep track of where you have been, you can be free to leave no trail!! Excellent way to search!!
__label__1 I first got this for my PC and everyone home has it on theirs.  Now I installed this on my android smart phone and works great.  What this does is lets you search without the spying from the usual search programs.
__label__1 This app brings me the most relevant search results first. No spamming my searches like other search engines do. With bang search you can, with convinience, search any sight on the web. If you are still using chrome or IE on your desktop, I suggest you s
__label__1 Have used this on my Mac, so I was glad to get it for my Kindle. If you have used it then you know all the benefits. It searches through a couple search engines, it cuts down on monitoring your activities.  If you are not familiar with it, you might want
__label__1 This is my default 'go to' PC search engine, so finding it in Android was great.  The downside is the lack of adding RSS feeds to it.
__label__1 I love that I can search different things and not be tracked. That is what makes this site so awesome.
__label__0 I deleted this app almost as quickly as I downloaded it. It's not user friendly! Don't bother with this one!
__label__1 I love that this is free and you receive so many news papers!! This is a great  way to get news from all over the country.
__label__1 VERY GOOD INFORMATION UP TO DATE AND ENJOY READING ALL THE UPDATED INFORMATION ABOUT THE WORLD AND ALL THE CURRENT NEWS
__label__0 What gives with the pop up ads that started today in USA Today? They are nuisance and sometimes will not close.  Amazon needs to get the real USA Today app, it is totally unacceptable!!!
__label__1 So many major newspapers in one place and one need not even step foot in a library to read them.No longer am I limited to just the local bird cage liner for print news.Best of all?  This app is environmentally friendly since there is nothing to throw out

__label__1 I got a Kindle for Christmas and I am still learning about it.  I signedon for the "UK news" because I love the UK and their newspapers.  A month on, I am receiving messages about my 30 day trial period so I am awaiting how much I will be able to enjoy t
__label__1 Great way to catch up on international news. Now I need twelve more words before I can post this comment.
__label__0 Is this sold as a kindle app? It appeared to be. But it does not work on my Fire. Wish it did. I was looking for a Reuters app.
__label__0 The &#34;heads up&#34; on &#34;free range&#34; pop-ups me off from using this. Is there a source for the Musical Times without pop-ups?
__label__1 What a great way to keep up with the 'goings on' in the Homeland!  Definitely a must have.  I love it.
__label__0 I am so happy I tried this on the day it was free. I would NEVER pay for this app. Four colours? Three shapes? Nothing extra like stencils or anything. Heck this is worse than the real thing (a white board) This is a pretty lame app with practically 1opt
__label__1 Its a whiteboard for the phone or tablet and it acts like one with the added advantage of saving.  Perfect.
__label__1 only handwritten note taking app that is usable.  a must have for any student.  I would recommend the ability to continue writing on a new board and save all the images on one file....but overall incredible app.  would have paid more for it!
__label__1 This thing responds much more quickly than a lot of other drawing apps out there.  Lots of features, very much like a whiteboard.  I feel like I could plug in my HDMI and give a lecture!Only thing is I get an error when I try to share (Asus Transformer f
__label__1 I use this for pictionery on game nights. now I have to type words so I can get to the 20 word minimum so I can submit this review. mainly reviewing to help offset the db's that give it one star because it happens to be a drawing app they don't want as f
__label__1 Yes... this app IS petfect. It does EXACTLY what developer states it will do. AND... no un-necessary permissions. Are there other &quot;similer&quot; apps out there? Yes... but, this doesn't claim to do anything that it can't.For all you cry-babies... it
__label__1 i love it i think it is awesome but that is my opinion post your opinion.and this is annabell i don't get this kindle fire.
__label__1 Nice and simple. Great for quick notes/random doodling. For anyone expecting full coloring capabilities, this obviously isn't the app for you, as it plainly states it is a whiteboard. Try Kids Doodle if that's what you're looking for.
__label__1 very nice app, and agree that the whiners need to get over whatever it is they think is wrong.  is there a way to input text? didn't notice it if there is. would be nice to put text descriptions in the shapes.... I prob just overlooked the feature?
__label__1 well I have a whiteboard at home but this is no normal whiteboard. this game you have to getthis game its asweome:)
__label__1 its. good but I rate it five stars because its good when it has more colors I will be very pleased.
__label__0 it won't download but if it does i hope it works.&frac12; i don't know what it meansbut someone tell me plz
__label__1 Less than 1mb file and no permissions, does just what it says.  This will be super when I want to make a quick note or drawing. 22 23 24 25
__label__0 I've gotten lots 10 of these types of apps already from the faodt! why would I need this!?! once again stood awake untill 3:15 and found this,,,,, why can't we have an app like yesterday's... fuggggggge! I'm so mad bro... superman75 plz rewiew this
__label__1 i uninstalled it from my phone so long ago i really can't remember the application sorry i can't help more
__label__1 I HAVE IT BUT HAVEN'T USED IT. I'm going to see if I can give this app a try again.
__label__1 Mt grandkids love to play with this. There is a range of colors, 3 sizes of lines and some geometric choices. A  bit more to it than I thought there would be, but not too much and not complicated to navigate.
__label__1 Nice app, it has no bugs and it just works, a great alternative for when you just want  randomly Doodle and don't want to use more complex drawing apps, such as drawing pad.N:B004WGGQPQ Drawing Pad]]its well done, I still have doodler as my default choic
__label__1 It is the ultimate whiteboard experience without the messy eraser and the dingy gray surface. Useful, provides everything you expect in a portable format, and can't be damaged by permanent markers. On the Kindle Fire,  teachers  can regularly use it in t
__label__1 This is a very fun app for the Fire. It's not a high-end drawing program, but great for doodles and quick diagrams. It offers both freehand drawing (with various colors and line thicknesses) plus defined shapes (circles, rectangles). Very easy to use.It 
__label__0 this is the crappiest game ever whiteboard for free I better so don't waste ur money on it very dissapointed
__label__1 This is perfect. I will likely use this more than Sketchbook because it's simple and easy to use. And all u folks who use the reviews to vent ur bizarre disappointments in life...or ur bizarre, um, sense of humor (?) need to go back to myspace. Or kinder
__label__1 Usually drawing with my fingers is a clumsy affair, (I'm lookin' at you, Drawing Pad) but I was quite surprised and pleased with the responsiveness and fine-tuning present in this app. It's simple, quick to use and save; a job well done.
__label__1 This app allows to do "quick and dirty"...ANYTHING you can think of. Just write or draw it on the screen. Even has an eraser...your finger! C-O-O-L !
__label__0 great I loaded this app gave it to my 4 year old and did a few chores in the house. I came back and found my tablet covered with Sharpie ink. being unhappy with the 4 colors junior decided to grab the permanent markers to add color. now I have a tablet w
__label__1 I love it so much that my mom can't take my kindle away from me. Don't listen to any other review. I am telling the truth.
__label__1 For a quick way to sketch some ideas, do a little brainstorming, this app looks to be great on the Fire.  In order to be able to change screen orientation on the Fire you are required to be able to read, very early in the process.  :)
__label__1 this app is very sexy very very sexy believe me I am serious I am I am please believeme I am serious this app is sexy
__label__1 I use it for to-do or shopping lists.  Pulling out the phone or Kindle Fire and scribbling a list is so easy that I haven't touched a post-it note in over a week.Whiteboard Pro is also great for quick notes -- phone numbers, dates, times, names, etc.Ther

__label__1 Simple, uncomplicated, stable.Unlike many of the other &quot;sketch / draw&quot; apps, this one is really uncomplicated. Whenever I'm out somewhere and need to sketch an idea, or an equation or I just feel like doodling, this is the app I go to first.
__label__1 Tomorrow I am going to alphabetize my sock drawer. I am always getting in trouble for balancing fine china on the tips of pencils. Bananas are nature's sex toy. Imagine a world without ladders.
__label__1 Before I had this I used a sharpie to take notes on my phone. There was a strange bug that wouldn't let me delete my notes and they would stay on my screen, even after a factory reset! Thank goodness for this app! Now I can keep my sharpie at home.
__label__1 This works great with the s-pen, would be nice if they added s-pen pressure vs. marker size support, but I'm not complaining in any way. Thank you for a good app
__label__1 This is a simple whiteboard app. It is fairly basic, but that I what I think makes it so great. Afterall, it is no more complicated than the whiteboard I have at my office. I used a tablet pen on this and it worked great. I'd recommend it for a dollar!
__label__1 Is it basic? I guess that would be a fair view. What I see is a very responsive app for tablet presentation. The app has whiteboard in the name, of you want to draw this might not be the app for you, if you want to create some basic presentation or desig
__label__1 For the longest time this app was incompatible with my Kindle Fire HD. Since it's become available for my Kindle, I've used it a lot to keep a toddler entertained, and to keep track of my school assignments.
__label__1 Boring, along with all the other ones like it. I am worried that when amazon sees all the 5 star reviews they will offer this sort of app once a week!
__label__1 can be a toy. but is. not , very helpful.exactly like a white paper where you can write,  drawing or just play.high recomemdation for this one
__label__0 this is like the 50th doodle app in the last month! come on amazon! it seems like if its not an arcade space game or doodle app its not free....give something useful or at least a different type of game.
__label__1 Very simple. Very useful. Downloaded fine on HTC Incredible running 2.3.4. Easy to use. Good for both myself &amp; my daughter. Enough said. Just try it out.
__label__1 I am always in need of a whiteboard and this is sweet. Has 4 colors which is enough to draw accordingly. I am an engineer and having to explain solutions or concepts to clients require lots of free space. Not to mention being able to export and share so 
__label__1 This is an app that gives you a portable electronic whiteboard, just as advertised. Is it a full-featured drawing app? Nope. Is it the app I would fire up to CAD/CAM a downtown hi-rise? Nope. Is it just about the best tool for quickly sketching out an id
__label__1 this application brings out the best in the worst! no one will ever regret downloading it! i tried it for some gaming ideas, and it worked like a charm! seriously, download this app.
__label__1 It's fun to draw stuff.Why would  say this? Well... it;s fun to draw stuff... typing stuff is not fun....ok? Well
__label__1 Nice and simple app. Minimal permissions. Does not try any internet nonsense. Very responsive. Easy to use controls. Like ease of drawing shapes.

__label__1 Don't blame or punish the dev of the FAOTD selection. That is done by Amazon. Rate the app, not your disappointment for staying up all night.This app does what is says. So it deserves to be rated for that.And what do you expect to lose if a 200k app can'
__label__1 Nicely done.  They set out to simulate writing on a whiteboard and did a nice job of that, then they added a few handy amenities such as drawing simple shapes.  My phone is a bit small to be that useful as a whiteboard but I suspect a tablet would work q
__label__1 This game sucks! it's wicked! gr8 for kindle fire and is good 2 waste time with! I highly recommend it!
__label__1 how come white people are always taken stuff from us black folk first our sick dance moves than our fat beats now ourwriting blackboards. how is we supposed to remember our crunk lyrics???
__label__1 I usually. never rate apps, but this one works great.True it is not a drawing app. But for simple doodles it is just what I needed. One of the things that I like most is that you can actually draw straight lines, perfect circles. etc. One thing I would w
__label__1 This app does exactly what it says, and does it well. Make simple drawings just like on a whiteboard. Works in landscape &amp; portrait, simple and easy, uses standard &quot;share&quot; capabilities and saves/exports in JPG and PNG  formats. It's perfect
__label__1 The kids really like this and think its a good decent app. Great for the doodler in the family or just for fun
__label__1 Apparently I am not alone with being totally SICK &amp; TIRED of these unemployed, talent-less &amp; obviously lonely trolls posed as &quot;reviewers&quot; &amp; would give ANYTHING if Amazon and/or developers had the ability to rid those of us who actua
__label__1 I love Whiteboard Pro.  Amazing how something so simple could be so cool.  The tools are very basic.  Use freehand lines or the straight/square/circle tools.  The color and width of the lines are adjustable.  There is an eraser and an undo/redo function.
__label__1 I cannot draw, period. So I certainly don't need some app with all kinds of colors, brush styles or various tools. The simpler the better. If you want a whiteboard to scribble on this is perfect. If you think of yourself as an artist there are numerous o
__label__1 This is a nice, simple, versatile app that works smoothly on the kindle.  Useful for diagrams when you don't have paper.
__label__1 I have a few drawing apps, but this has got to be the best. Simple but with just enough features and colors to create neat drawings. I think I may cloud my others and keep this one on my K.F.  Thanks Gross Software and Amazon.
__label__1 I needed something to jot down notes quickly, this is it. I tried several other apps that say they do the same thing, but for me, this one fits the bill.Can't say enough about it. Works flawlessly on my Kindle Fire tablet HD.Recommend to anyone!!
__label__1 This is by far the best doodling app I've used. It is simple and effective. Highly recommended for everyone that likes to draw things. I'm having a blast with it.
__label__1 Wouldn't  suprised if Amazon stops this program soon. Must be hard to find developers willing to endure these irrelevant reviews. A little mind blowing how expectant people are of something they aren't even entitled to. BTW never used this app, don't int
__label__1 it's pretty cool that they make a line,cicle,and more for you but they don't have a lot of Colors all they have is blue,black,red,and green but still this is a fun game
__label__1 I really love this app!!! the only problem is: there should be more colors!!! I would give this a 4&frac12;  but I cant soo 5 stars for Whiteboard Pro
__label__0 Some serious complainers about the free app program from amazon. First off, it's a paid app for free. Either good or bad, amazon gets these devs to give their product away for free. But everyone will do that, and that's why you will see apps that you thi
__label__1 okay, this app is great. I am glad I did not believe the reviews about landscape mode. It works on the Toshiba thrive, has 4 different colors, extremely easy interface, easy change from draw to erase and basic shapes. I often illustrate small notes at wo
__label__1 Thought this app was amazing! Did everything it adveritised and more! Great for artists and anything of the sort. GET IT!!!!!
__label__1 Growing up in the 70s, I prefer blackboards and chalk to these fancy whiteboards and dry erase markers. However, there is no option in this app for drawing on a slate blackboard. Please update with this option as it would also save on battery life by pro
__label__1 This app is an &quot;etch a sketch&quot; for your phone/pad/etc. No more boring meetings!And Superman, you need to trade in your smart phone for a rotary dial phone!
__label__1 This is a great app for children,they could draw or play something called&quot;teacher&quot;that is a great game because that child could be the teacher and they could get toys or other children to be the students.This is a great app.PLEASE NOTE:this app
__label__1 I like this app it helps me practice for deviant art it's helpful for school to people get this app
__label__1 I have tried many different drawing apps and this one works the best.  I use it on my Acer A500 and the touch is right on where you place it.  I have deleted all other drawing apps.  Thanks.
__label__1 I am not a "tech-head" and have never used an app. like this until today. I have been playing with it on-and-off all morning on my Fire and find it easy to use.  I've had no problems at all.  If Amazon hadn't offered this as the FAOTD, I most likely woul
__label__1 This is great! It's got four basic colours, three marker sizes, and infinite possibilities. If you've used a smartboard for a whiteboard, then this is waaay better.
__label__1 Dude. I do a lot of LSD and this app it great for swirlies. the gnome in my fridge likes it too. now if I could just find my pants.
__label__1 my niece will love it, and I can share it with family and friend's. also it's free so it's worth the price.
__label__0 Wont list what your supose to have Wont let you sign into your account!  SUCKS!  SUCKS! SUCKS! NEEDS WORK! GRRR
__label__0 I downloaded pocketBlu with high excitement, but was let down. After I downloaded it to my Kindle FireHD, it will not run at all. The program will open and a page for redemption of Digital Movie codes opens. That is as far as it goes. Every thing on the 
__label__1 I think its funny how I can control my dvr from my kindle fire and not my dumd romote for my tv
__label__0 Beside Amazon app (Kindle fire HDX), I tried this on play.google.com (my phone) and Windows. None of them working. On portable part, both are not responding to my request to download. On my Windows PC, it says server is not ready. Failed app. Stop promot
__label__0 I absolutely love the app. It works great and moves fast. App is really cool and I really enjoy it
__label__0 This may be a good product but it will not work, have tried several times but my Kindle Fire can't recognize my Blu-ray player, or the player can't recognize the Kindle, either way it won't work. Good thing it was free or I would want my money back!!
__label__1 I have been using this app for about two weeks.  well-written and we&apos;ll done,  with all kinds of useful and interesting extras,  especially if you use jog tracker pro.
__label__0 Unable to use on old Droid X2 and forced closing a constant issue. It was suggested to go with the PRO version and it performed as well as the free version. NOT AT ALL.
__label__1 This tools great for tracking my walks. I love that you can track distance and speed. I also like that you can save and upload your walks.
__label__1 This app does a great job of letting me know how far I've traveled when I'm exercising. Don't be fooled by the name it also will track when you walk as well.
__label__1 I love being able to track my jobs and to see how fast I run. I especially like the ability to estimate how many calories that i burned. The best part is, it's free! :D
__label__1 My daughter enjoys this game. She loves to match everything and she has already mastered it and is still not tired of playing.
__label__1 love the way it says the letter out loud but wish I could turn the volume up.  my two year old grandson enjoys this app runs okay on the fire.
__label__0 Title says it all, just a very stupid game, I dont like it, my daughter does not like it, just does not make anything fun or learning tbh.
__label__1 A memory game to match the alphabet letters.  Simply does what it is supposed to and is good for keeping a preschooler busy for a few minutes.  There is a Color Match and a Number Match, too. Looks and runs fine on my Kindle Fire.
__label__1 We love this game.  My kid who is 3 can play it by himself.  The cards are nice and big and easy to click.
__label__1 I bought this game to introduce my 3 year old to letter recognition. I really like that it speaks the letter as it is revealed. She enjoys this game & it helps keep her busy on long car trips.
__label__0 ..... for my 6 yr old. This was never used, so I deleted it. Nice idea, just wish there was more to it.
__label__1 This is a simple app. I do like it for my 4 yr old. I wish the voice was clearer, and a feature to repeat the letter if tapped again would be a nice touch. The only thing that I can't stand is when you make a match the voice says  &quot;Good job with the
__label__0 The app crashes on the Galaxy Nexus using Ice Cream Sandwich. Really annoying when you want to work out and it stops mid way through.
__label__1 I have been using Cardio for my jogs, workouts but I like this one better for just jogs as it gives more data and analysis than Cardio. I might start using this  more as I hate my Cardio app force closing on my Atrix often.
__label__1 A lot of people bash this app because they say there are better available.  While that may be true this one does everything it says it does.  I personally got this app when it was FAOTD and have used it on a few different runs.  It works quite well, and 
__label__1 This is a solid program with several beneficial features, including real-time charting of speed, pace, and altitude (especially helpful here in Colorado) in the pro version. And the permissions are appropriate and not intrusive. I am not the developer! (
__label__1 This program is simple to use, has a clean interface, and is better without those ads. I was not able to try the heart rate monitor function, but if it works, it is a great feature.Thanks amazon for having another health and fitness related free app for 
__label__1 It's so sad that most of the time when an app is put up for free on here, it becomes the kiss of death for the app.  People complaining about it being a free app, people giving not serious one star reviews, and people picking the app apart like it's supp
__label__1 This is to everyone complaining about free apps.  I love the sense of entitlement some of you have.  Have any of you ever heard &quot;different strokes for different folks&quot;.  Just because it doesn't interest you, doesn't make it a bad offering.  its
__label__1 The activity selection needs to be updated. It is missing several common modes of transportation: crutches, skipping, sit-n-spin, riding lawnmower, wheel barrow, piggy back, three-legged, somersault, on hands and knees, segway, and hot air balloon. Thank
__label__0 the only device that I have that can get apps, is my kindle fire, when I try to run it records it but this app actually broke my kindle fire because it fell out
__label__0 Yea I had trouble with the controls too so I really don't know if it's fun or not maybe if it actually worked
__label__0 horrible its just horrible its even hard to get the eggs and its horrible graphics I don't even wanna give it 1 star
__label__0 horrible I hats it it has bad controls, bad graphics, and the most ANNOYING songs ever! even my brother didn't like it AND HES ONLY 5 YEARS OLD! !! Don't buy it!!!
__label__0 Omg. This game is horrible. The sky is all gloomy and depressing. Not to mention that it is stupid and not fun at all. All you do is look for eggs and get a headache after playing it for about 5 seconds. This is the kind of game meant for a retarded 3 ye
__label__1 I love this app! I like that I can write with my finger or type on the page if I choose. Since I type fast it would be great if the app wouldn't lag behind. I recommend this app for anyone who likes to keep notes or journals. I currently have this app ru
__label__1 Wait till 12:30am for app to b free!  2:30am central time.This app is exactly what I have been looking for!  I never have anything to write with and the main thing I miss from my old phone was notepad.  Thanks to the dev and to amazon for a useful FAOTD 
__label__1 I adore this application. I have been searching for a basic notepad app for a while and this one finally delivers. I have experienced no FC, lag time or any problems on my HTC EVO running Gingerbread 2.3.I love how I can write as big as I need to and it 
__label__0 This app is not working out for me. I have tried several times and my notes just look like unreadable scribbles. I need a writing app where I can use the keyboard. It is possible you can do this with this app but I have not figured out how to do so.
__label__1 Works great on my HTC Incredible. So much faster than typing on regular notepad with the keyboard. Finally an alternative to the standard notes app! Better grab this free app of the day while you can. Once you try it you'll agree it's well worth the pric
__label__1 I don't know if it is innovative, but I can say it is the first time I have seen an application that records a character or sequence of characters and lets you replace or redo later. Works surprisingly well with fat fingers.
__label__0 This used to be a great app and now it won't open. Tried uninstalling, rebooting, nothing works. Please fix ASAP!
__label__1 personally I love this app! It is easy to use and if I'm in a hurry to write myself notes or Xmas ideas it comes in handy. I think it is worth the money. I haven't found too many other apps like this that work well. love it!!!
__label__0 This really took time to try to understand.  Not useful so deleted it and will look for another option that will be better
__label__1 This app is great! I had been looking for just this type of application to use on my Kindle Fire HD 8.9. I am testing it on my Motorola Zoom while I await the arrival of the Fire 8.9. I love the user interface. I also like the many available paper option
__label__1 I just purchased the app. for my Kindle Fire with the thought that I might be disappointed. NOPE, I love it.  I teach Chemistry and being able to draw molecular structures right next to notes!  YES SIR!!!  I can't afford a "Tablet" and apps like this one
__label__1 Great APP. Still learning. Great for work, School,,reminders,Saves on on paper and saving a simple little note you just jot down while pressed with time.A+
__label__1 I've been looking for something like this since I got my Android phone. easy to use. nice design. easier than typing when you need to write fast. Overall very useful.
__label__0 Wow. This app is absolutely terrible. I don't see how anyone could ever stand using this for more than drawing pictures that even a preschooler could put to shame. The idea for something like this for a phone is a bad idea in the first place, because it 
__label__1 This app works good, and is very useful when taking notes. I am using it with a stylus which I find works much better then just using your finger.
__label__0 great app. I would like to see password protection added. I could use this as a journal if this feature was included. please add. thanks
__label__0 If this were a FREE app it still would not be worth the money.  I have a fairly good writing hand but on this thing it turns it into what looks like hen scratching - almost totally unreadable.  And you dare not lift your finger from the screen until the 
__label__1 I bought the pro version for my Kindle Fire and have the free versions on my Android phone and Acer tablet. It is so nice to be able to quickly open the notepad and actually write a quick note without having to hunt out tiny keys or special characters.  
__label__0 Would not recommend, app was not displaying properly on Kindle fire.  Couldn't figure it out. And of course the app itself wouldn't let me adjust any settings
__label__1 This app does just what it claims. You can customize the pen, and layout of the notes. Now I have to work on my penmanship. Quicker and easier than typing if you just need to scribble out a note. I use it on my charge and my XOOM and have had no problems
__label__0 This app was not what I expected. It lets you write with a finger, but it posts the text before you can cross a T or dot an I.  I removed it from my Kindle Fire HD
__label__1 worth getting. very useful. helps to have a stylus but it isn't necessary. I like it a lot. definitely a good buy.
__label__1 Nice app...super fun to play with but....I regret paying almost 4 dollars for it.....I wish there were a free version
__label__0 This app is not worth it! There is an app called &quot;Notepad&quot; by Michael Checca. It is much better and it is free. DO NOT GET THIS APP!!! Go &quot; Notepad&quot;!!! And boo &quot;Handrite Note Pro&quot;!!!!!
__label__1 I mainly use this app  to take notes. Its simple and quick enough that I can write notes on the fly before I forget as I'm not thinking about what button to press. definitely a unique app.
__label__1 I love this app! It's quicker than typing and it's perfect for a quick note. I have lists on my phone that I can update quickly, because I use this app. Love it!
__label__1 It works fast and remarkably well .. You use your finger to write a word and it instantly makes it small to fit on the page so you don't have to worry about using tiny writing . Is very fast .. Can be stored on SD card , I really see no negatives and if 
__label__1 When I have a thought in my head or something I have to remember I can quick jot it down on this by using my keyboard or using my finger to write.  It works very well and in an intuitive fashion.  Easy to use.
__label__1 Works great.  Doesn't convert your writing to text but enters your handwriting on a tablet.  I will use this when my 5 year old asks me how to write a letter or number.  Definitely gets a spot on one of my screens for quick access.
__label__1 this app is really cool I love it! literally, you write something out with your finger and it puts it on a notepad, exactly as how you wrote it. kudos to the developer! I love free app of the day! :)
__label__1 I think that this is a great app once you take the time to learn how to use it. You can use your fingers to write or the keyboard to type your message. This is replacing my other note app.
__label__1 This app does what it says. I keep a widget on one of my screens for quick notes. I was always fumbling in my purse for pen and paper. Great for times when you need to jot down a phone number quickly.
__label__1 This is a very handy app when you need to jot something quick.  It is also helpful when you need to use nonstandard characters.  You can incorporate small drawings and such.
__label__1 Really cool app! Easy to use, would recommend to anyone 1-100. It's fun to see your terrible handwriting come to life on screen!
__label__1 I first purchased the free app and really liked it because it was easy to use.  but the small ad at the top/bottom of the screen sucked.  so i gritted my teeth and bought the pro version of this for i think $3.99.  It was totally worth it, i don't have t
__label__1 Being a simple note pad is a necessary thing for a smartphone. This app is great because it allows you to write your own notes in your own handwriting and then scales the word down to fit reasonably on the note sheet. Definitely easier than fiddling with
__label__1 Works really well as a quick way to jot down notes by writing directly on your screen with your finger. The resulting &quot;handwritten&quot; memos are surprisingly legible and space-efficient. For me it's a nice efficient way to write a quick memo witho
__label__1 I use this app constantly, so much so that I added it to one of my Circle Launcher icons on my phone so it's always handy. Anytime I need to jot something down, directions, shopping list -- this is the app for the job!Turn your phone sideways for the eas
__label__1 I just installed this on my Samsung Galaxy YP-G70 and it seems to work fine.  Not sure when or how I will use it.  Nice to get a free app that's unique and not a game, since most of the games seem to just be a variation of another game.Update: Also insta
__label__1 Great app for all ages...its alot of fun &amp; useful! You can write in different colors, on different paper &amp; all sizes.
__label__1 Come in extremely handy on the kindle fire. Don't know y the bad review, but maybe if some folks would go through the tutorial they may get better use of the app.A download must, download this app.
__label__1 I love technology, but there are times I revert to the old things. This is one of those apps that allows that. Like my Grocery List  and addresses that are given to me over the phone or when in person.
__label__1 At first I was a bit skeptical of this app because I'm not a fan of writing things directly on my phone screen, and I thought it'd be a nuisance to use, but it's not. I'm glad it was free but it's very nice
__label__1 Great add on for Kindle Fire HD. style and ease of use is why I got it. Glad I have it.
__label__1 This app gives you exactly what it says it will - a way to jot quick notes with your finger. Yes, a stylus would be neater, but when you want to note something fast, this is an easy way to do it.
__label__0 I am UN able to print directly to my printer.  Just a portion Will print of each note and its very large
__label__1 This is a terrific app.  You write the words large and it shrinks them down into a list.  It's  perfect.  At first I thought the writing was too large and didn't make sense, until it autaumatically resized it.  Genius!  For free, you'd be silly not to tr
__label__1 If you want to use your Kindle in a more traditional way, this program will be very useful for you as sometimes writting by hand is more enjoyable than typing.
__label__1 Yes, this ap works great.  Lets you type or hand-write notes for your kindle.  Lets you store separate pages for separate projects.  Super easy to navigate.  Definitely glad I downloaded this ap.
__label__0 I bought this app here on Amazon after using the free version for over a year.  Recently I discovered that the &quot;Pro&quot;  version sold here is the same as the &quot;Lite&quot;  (free) version on the other major app selling site. I  thought it must 
__label__1 I always found myself with out a pen to write important messages. With this brilliant app problem is resolved. Thanks developer. Brilliant!!!
__label__1 First off it does exactly what is says it can, what ever motion my finger does it replicated.However, I don't see this as something people will use &quot;just to take a quick note&quot;.  Where I see it getting the most use is by kids.  It could be made 
__label__1 After trying several apps, looking for one that will allow me to handwritten rather than type, THIS IS THE ONE!!!!! Knowing that it works so well, I WOULD PAY 2x THE PRICE FOR IT!!!! TERRIFIC APP!!!!!!
__label__1 Using a virtual pen that follows the touch strokes is a great idea but there should be an option to make the pen tip visible for better control. This app has potential for further development into the realm of handwriting recognition, handwriting analysi
__label__1 This is a WONDERFUL APP.  It does what it says and in my opinion, is awesome for any kind of note, entry, etc. It also has a bunch of other things you can do like change the color, faunt, size, add attachments, and much, much more.  I highly reccomend it
__label__1 this app is pretty great. some people here don't like it, that's fine, but shouldn't rate it low. it does exactly what is says it does and very well. I personally enjoy it, just set the milliseconds to  around 145 and you get a great writing experience. 
__label__1 I really like using this app. I love to write and it lets me do just that! It comes in handy.
__label__1 This product is just what I wanted.  it is a way to take notes with my kindle fire!  thank you.
__label__0 The idea is appealing: Just use your finger to write notes. For that to be better then typing, the app must be very responsive and sensitive. That, unfortunately, is where this app fails. When I try to draw letters, the app does not respond quickly or wi
__label__0 I've tried to give this app a try but its really terrible.  To take notes is really bad.  The options are confusing its never clear how to take notes.  I can't save them whats the point.
__label__0 thank you guys I took your advice and didn't fey the app.Thank you,thank you, thank you. I think they should get a truth or dare app that is for kids and has at the least 100 truths and 100 dares.
__label__0 I really dont like this app and deleted it soon after i got it because every time you play, you get the same questions in the same order and you cant evn choose if you want truth or dare..
__label__0 it doesn't have many to chose from and the ones you CAN chose suck and I like it when they chose the truth/ dare randomly
__label__1 Hello. I'm EmilyJksn. Also known as Emily Jackson. I want to tell you that I think this is a great game. Here is my story:One day I decided to look for fun games.  I have the older kindle fire. Don't be fooled by all the 4,3,2, &amp; 1 stars. This is a g
__label__1 I luv this app! it is the best app ever! it is the only appropriate truth or dare game for kids!!! this app rocks!
__label__0 I looked through the first couple dares... so lame and nothing I would ever do with my friends. None of the truth or dares on Amazon are any good.
__label__0 Took your advise and I am glad I did id say DO NOT GET THIS CRAP!!! YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED
__label__0 it is bad don't get this game.  it is very boring. you can not say no or yes. it just tells you to do someting
__label__1 i love it but you can not plah by your self it is not as fun as if you were to play with a bunch of friends i had a.slumber party and we played this game it is great for sleep overs it rocks
__label__0 this game is so stupid all it does is gives you requests and you really dont even get to answer back dumbest app ever! it deserves 0 stars!!!
__label__0 It isn't a challenge after a while i have to give in and lose. You can never lose because its near impossible for a balloon to pass down to the spikes so after about 3 minutes of just touching balloons nonstop it gets boring. This is okay for little kids
__label__0 its not that fun of a game and some times no matter how much you touch if, it does nothing and then it goes down then POP it goes
__label__1 This game is fun for the whole family.  You tap the balloons on the bottom so that the balloons don't pop on the spikes.  You have three lives.  It lasts forever.  See how high you can get your score.  It was fun for me, and my family likes it.  I would 
__label__1 I loved this game it is so much fun and once you start to play trust me you cant stop!!! :)
__label__0 The minute I started the first level, I had already gotten bored. I know the touch screen works, but the balloons will not float up when I tap them! This app is a waste of your time and space on your kindle. But if they fixed that, I would try it again.
__label__1 its soo fun for the kindle fire. the people who hates this doesn't know fun plus it is a challenge. I thin you should get this app. its soo fun I play it too much.
__label__0 I got this stupid game out of bordum but regretted it instantly! there was nothing to the game! all you did was just push up.on the balloons. that's it. don't even bother with this cruddy app-.-
__label__1 this game is great!I think you should make a new level pack!it will be very very very great!
__label__0 Ok, so I thought the game would be fun according to some of the reviews. And was I wrong! After I was dead and my score came up I was dissapointed. So plz have some sense and listen when I tell you its very BORINGGG!!!!! Deleted this app immediantly.
__label__0 Do not get this gamedon't get itdon't get itdon't get itis anyone even reading this I mean why do we make reviews if no one reads them all!?!!?
__label__0 it dissent work for kindle fire the game is off and it is very very very slow so it is hard to get it
__label__0 it gets really old and to do the fun LOOKING apps it costs 1 dollar a game.it may say its free but you have to pay about 3 dollars to get the full game.DON'T. GET THIS APP YOU GET RIPPED OFF!!!!!!!!!
__label__1 Super fun game sort of hard love it make a new level? SWEET Anyway its fun to do if you have nothing to do :p
__label__1 this game is the best!!!! i like all the modes and it gives you enough in the free one to keep you playing for a while!!! super fun!!!!! really pretty on my kindle fire!
__label__1 Okay, first of all, awesome!!! (see how I put THREE exclamations points) Very simple and for kids of all ages. I hot over 7,000,000 points on my first try for survival mode with no hints!!!!!! I don't think that they need to show the modes that you don't
__label__1 This app is absolutely awesome. You'd never think bouncing a balloon with your finger over a line would be one of the best games you will ever play. And it is. Addicting, crazy-fun. You really should get this app. Completely worth it.
__label__0 on kindle firethe balloons don't go up when u touch them. it just sucks. Please don't get it even if its free!
__label__1 Well this game is fun at first but after a while it gets boring because after you get to know all the levels it gets boring.Still a good game though.
__label__1 one day I was playin' &quot;FLOAT&quot;&amp; won level 22 and got 2,160,000 week!!!!yayy lalalalalala oh uh ha ur still here heheeee just whistlin' unhurt ummm byebye
__label__0 this is very stupid I like happy poo better you should get happy poo. my finger really hearts from swiping I donot like it
__label__1 I think its hilarious how people complain about permissions. Theres a good chance that these same people have a Facebook account yet they dont realize how much information they're giving out with it. They also probably know nothing about the coding and d
__label__1 this game rocks.. for you tards that for a free Of Optimus in your Cheerios... throw it away... of at Stuperman 75 when you see him on the corner turning tricks
__label__1 I love this game..  I get to use my brain for once in a game that isn't overly complex. This is a great game to sit down and blow a bit of time. I'm glad I installed it!
__label__0 on either my high end tablet or my low end phone. I think this is the first program I've ever found that wouldn't run on either!

__label__0 I have an LG vortex and this app installed then crashed my phone, undoing some of my settings and apps. And the gravity burst application did not fully install. This is a very unstable application.
__label__0 come on again really I absolutely hate these kind of games get a new kind. we need beter and newer
__label__0 This app sucked waste of space!!!!! Don't get it! I would have put zero stars but my kindle fire wouldn't let me!! Please if u r not a idiot don't get it! :(
__label__0 Per the description that states sticky (unsecure broadcast) intents are required for Air, is the developer implying one must download the huge-sized Adobe Air onto their devices in order to play this game? If so, it should state that clearly as well and 
__label__1 When I first saw this FAOTD, I thought to myself: wow, not another space shooter game.  But I was surprised...it's not a space shooter (well, not a standard shooter anyway).  If anything, it's more like a puzzle game just with a space theme.  Some of the
__label__0 Very creative concept, and worth the initial frustration of learning the controls. So, four stars for originality. However, you don't need a network socket open to move pixels around the screen of a Kindle Fire. So, deduct all stars for demanding permiss
__label__0 I want a game, not a bunch of ads or my data being mined. Good game, but not worth it.
__label__0 This app is a nice playing game and the gravity well concept is unique and adds difficulty to playing. It plays smoothly and has some nice features.Unfortunately the requested sticky application an Internet access leaves your device open to unlimited pro
__label__0 I give this app one start because of permissions. I will download it and give it a try when I don't have to be scared it will mess up my phone
__label__1 Adobe Air is NOT necessary, either, btw. I don't have it installed & it still works perfectly fine. I don't even like shooters & I really liked this. It's the type where there are planets, & the planets' gravity affects where your ammo goes. Figured I'd 
__label__1 Could care less about the game just like reading superman's comments..I think there should be an app of just his of the wall insane comments and maybe it could be the faotd
__label__0 not very fun. pretty boring. what's with all the free apps being non compatible with the optimus? anyways not worth it
__label__1 This game was fun for a little while.  Good way to kill some time while waiting for someone but that is it.
__label__0 Couldn't get this app to run. Tried several times, only got a black screen. Very disappointed because I had high hopes for a fun, brain stimulating game. Reviewers, don't assume people who can't get the apps to work have an inferior phone, and don't assu
__label__0 I've never had any app suck a battery to death so fast. fail. game was ok, nothing special. uninstalling now
__label__1 I've downloaded so many apps for the Fire that I've had to delete a bunch of them in order to make room for more. This is one of those that I've kept. That should be reason enough for you to try it out. It's fun and worth the download. I can't say that a

__label__1 fun I like the name its just really fun whoever gave it a bad review it is good I think you would like 5 stars
__label__0 The idea was appealing, but the execution is a bit sloppy. After you fire the missiles your own base disappears while the missiles loop and slingshot to your target. When there are multiple targets your shot includes enough missiles to hit all targets. S
__label__1 As a fat guy I hate gravity. As a Christian I don't believe in it. As a republican I feel gravity is a liberal elitist farce hell bent on undermining the nature of God. As an object I tend to stay in....WALL!!!!
__label__0 I hate this game :(it's really hard and stupidA better game is Angry birdsI really hate it you shouldn't get this
__label__1 Well researched from the original and ancient texts, manuscripts, by a splendid team of writers - this is a version you should add to your library... this app is very well done and true to the text
__label__0 the biggest problem with this app is that the background is gray and the font is gray so it is hard on the eyes. there is no setting to change this.  I would not recommmend this app to anyone.
__label__1 I have really, really found this version to be very helpful when I am doing bible studies as it makes for easier understanding in breaking the verses down into plain english. I usually read the King James version but alot of people do not like the thee's
__label__1 This is a great Bible app. The main advantage is that it is downloaded to your kindle and you can read it any where without wi-fi. I have been using NLT for many years and find it to be the best for the true meaning of the scriptures. The free &quot; you
__label__1 The NLT version is the first bible I read through. This was several years ago and since I have read five other versions through completely (including KJV).
__label__1 just like the print version. Like the red letters.  getting used to the features to jump from one place to another.
__label__1 Absolutely love this app.  I can carry my Bible everywhere with me and find scripture references with the touch of a finger.  I love being able to take notes in church right on the app.
__label__1 This is my favorite version, however I have purchased the Mathew Henry commentaries, which are an integral part of any study guide.  It has a smooth integration and the other Bible versions are as smooth.  I like it since it is an offline bible.
__label__1 I love this bible translation. It was my first time reading it. It is very easy and help you understand the bible.
__label__1 Love reading this. Like all it has to offer with different versions and the audio. Will continue studyingthis bible.
__label__1 To have all these translations, as well as commentaries, available in one app is a GREAT time saver!  The share feature is also something I use a  lot, whether it be to something like facebook, or to my email to use in something in the future (or to some
__label__1 I really like it.  This is my first for this version.  Considering adding another one or two and using the parallel format.  I do like the ease of using it and the highlighting and notes portion.
__label__0 This use to be the BEST bible app for offline. With the recent update now the owners can charge you through sms messaging , according to my trust go security app. I'm very dissappointed that another company doesn't care about the consumer.
__label__1 I love this Tecarta Bible App. I switch easily between several versions as I read, quickly able to compare the way different translations or paraphrases as I process spiritual truth. The Message and the NLT in particular present vocabulary and phrases di

__label__1 This app works so well for me.  Its very easy to navigate through and eash to mark, highlight, etc. I highly recommend.
__label__1 Love the software with this Bible.  I like to put two translations together side beside and this software provides for that.  Once you learn the features it is pretty phenominal.
__label__1 best Bible app I'he come across. Able to add other translations very easily as could be and switch between Bible

__label__1 This translation is a great understandable and the closest to the original as possible.  I recomend it to anyone who is interested in really ubderstanding what the Bible sayes.
__label__1 Easy to use, quick select bible verse, easy navigation.Coordinates well with other translations by same publisher. Love the feature that gives expanded definition of words.
__label__1 This is the virsion our Pastor uses and I can now follow what he is reading. Good to have. Yea

__label__1 I highly recommend this Bible as it is easy to use.  It's the one I use for my daily reading.
__label__1 This app I find easy to use, very powerful delivers a very readable and accurate translation of the Bible.  I find myself using it in church in lieu of my study bible for its rapid changing to other books, and verses.I recommend it to everyone. And like 
__label__1 Enjoy listening to the Bible and reading with the person reading the Bible.  I seem to get a lot more out of it.
__label__1 We have several different bibles on our Kindle. None are easy to navigate. They got it right with this one. I really like the highlight feature along with notes and bookmarks. I will probably add a couple more versions. Great app for a tablet. I have it 
__label__1 Having used another book for the NASB Bible and experiencing issues that made it unusable, I searched and found this App.  This is far beyond the one I had used for 3 months. Search can be done by the book you're reading, the Old Testament, and New Testa
__label__1 The other Bible I had on my kindle  the books of the Bible were so small that I had a hard time finding the names of the books.  I have macular degeneration and the new one helps a great deal.  Thank you.

__label__1 This is the very best Bible on the market. I have quit a number of Bible books, apps on my Kindle but this one is by far the best.  I use it to the exclusion of all the others.
__label__1 It is easy to get from book to book and verse to verse.  I love the version {NASB} and the notes section.
__label__1 This is my third Tecarta Bible and I have never been disappointed. It is so easy to navigate and being able to do hilighting in the color of your choice, insert margin notes and organize and rename bookmarks is wonderful. It has a night reading mode (whi

__label__1 I really like this app.  I have used another one, and I think that this one is easier to use.

__label__1 Great Bible App. easy to navigate and has many great features for study and reading.  I especially like the cross reference and footnote features which are easy to access in the text.  The text-to-speech feature for having verses read aloud is really goo
__label__1 NASB is one of the easiest versions to understand God's word. One of the best translations of the Bible. Get it.
__label__1 This bible app was exactly what I wanted. I needed just the new american standard version with quick easy access to verses in a hurry. Using this app for this purpose does not require an internet connection. It comes with lots of extra features which you
__label__1 I loaded this on my tablet as a second translation (NIV was first). It is great to be able to see translations side by side. I also really like the ability to highlight text and add margin notes. Navigation is easy.
__label__1 I have tried many Bible apps and this one is the easiest one I have used.  It is very simple to highlight or bookmark things.  You can even make your own notes in the margins. They way you scroll thru the chapters and versus makes finding things even eas
__label__1 I like the translation (NASB) and the fact that I can take notes, highlight things and find things easily. I also like that it will read to me while I'm doing other things.
__label__1 I enjoy playing this game. This is the first version I have tried so far but once I get started I lose track of time.
__label__0 I was looking for a game to just kill some time with, this is not the game to do that with. Boring, cheap looking, not fun at all.
__label__1 I love this game and have been playing it for a while these last couple of days. Hope others enjoy.
__label__1 Challenging and fun!  There are many games to play.  I don't know how many there are yet because I've only completed 113 successfully.  As you proceed, the games get harder but, if you're persistent, they CAN be won and you can move on.  I set myself a t
__label__1 Have played this for a couple of months. The variety in levels keeps me coming back. Some levels clear quickly while others require more skill. LG Optimus V.
__label__1 This is my favorite game i ever downloaded!! There are MANY levels so you can keep playing. It's also esdy to play.
__label__1 I love this game, but just the other game just like it, bubble buster, is bad now. I upgraded it and now the colors are terrible! I cant tell blue from purple and its pretty bad. I just wish it was back to the way it was like this game! I love bubble sho
__label__0 This is perhaps the worst bubble shooter out there. The graphics are horrible, they may look ok on a phone but on the kindle Fire HD they are rough. There are no finite controls, you just tap the screen in the general direction that you want the ball to 
__label__1 This is just good, clean, simple fun.  The levels increase in difficulty yet beginning  levels are fun for younger kids.For the elderly, it's sure to advance carpal tunnel.

__label__1 This app is a lot of fun. The levels get tricky. I highly recommend getting this app. Really cool. Get this app!
__label__1 Fast reflexes and some relatively quick thinking skills are necessary for this type of game.  This one has a nice flow and has had absolutely no negative operational issues on Kindle Fire.  (I do find that the "Loser!" taunt when you mess up a level is a
__label__1 Highly addictive.  Fun for everyone in my family.  Eveny four year old loves it. Drains the battery quite fast but a lot of fun.
__label__1 This is a very fun game that all of us really enjoy and like to play on the Kindle Fire.
__label__1 Love it, but very addictive. Enjoy playing the game daily. I am now to level 60 or more and I can't get enough.
__label__1 I installed this on my Kindle Fire after I discovered that Bubble Buster was ruined by the last update. Bubble Shooter works very well on the Fire, just as BB did at first. Please don't ruin it with updates.
__label__1 This is fun.  My grand-daughter, (who is 7) just loves playing it...and I find my hands itching to play it instead.  Great game for young children to work on improving problem solving skills!
__label__1 I'm hooked on this game... it's just to fun... I love this game!!! This is one of the most fun bubble shooter games ever!
__label__1 This game was intended for my 4 year old grandson's Kindle Fire that I gave him for Christmas. I put it in my Fire to test if it was appropiate for a 4 year old.It actually is, but as the stages of the game advance it becomes a real challenge and I'm tot
__label__1 This  bubble game is the first game I downloaded on to my first android phone . It has been around for years  so the graphics are not the best. But it has over 900 levels and gets pretty challenging at times. A classic .
__label__1 I have this game on my phone and that is how I first found out about it. After getting a Kindle Fire, I found it on there! It's a great game. It helps to pass time. I play alot before bed to help me fall asleep :-)
__label__1 I really enjoy playing Bubble Breaker. Once I start playing, its hard for me to put it down. I am always trying to break my last score. Great game!
__label__0 No:(
__label__0 This game is so slow and boring that my three year old grandson won' t even play it. Don't waste your time.
__label__1 The game keeps me thinking of new ways to get rid of all the bubbles, I know that's not the object but that's what I want to do.
__label__1 This is really fun.
__label__0 No challenge whatsoever. You will be tempted to throw your phone across the room. Don't. You have been warned ahead of time. Keep it simple, don't download this game.
__label__0 I was not happy with the game. It was kinda boring to play.  Needed more of somoething. Not quite sure what
__label__1 This game is fun when you are board but other than that its annoyingbecause its just busting bubbles id rather play a diffrent game
__label__1 I like this gamefun and easy to use  I had bubble popper on old keypad kindle  and this game is just as much fun
__label__1 I like this bubble breaker just haven't got them all broke but once....I am not very good at it. Amazon
__label__0 Too small.
__label__0 I am sorry to say but this app isn't fun at all. You would be better by playing it with a friend.
__label__0 To be honest, this is the worst game ever. There is no point. I really wish I could rate this... horribleness of an app no stars. WORST APP EVER! DO NOT GET!!!

__label__1 I really enjoy this game. It includes everything you need to stay challenged.
__label__1 This a great game. It's so much easier than using a book and a pencil. So many options for playing.
__label__1 I got this app when it was the FAOTD, but I would gladly have paid the asking price, had I known what a terrific gaming app this would be.  I used to be into sudoku a few years back, but don't really play it much anymore.  I figured, what the heck, it's 
__label__1 I've played a bit of Sudoku, usually with paper and pencil. But this program is wonderful. It allows you to compute possible answers for each square (1-9), or just let the program do that boring part! You can go into a &#34;color&#34; mode, where you can
__label__1 Switching between pencil and pen marks took me a game or two to get used to, but after that the game plays great.  Very responsive to the touch.  Hard to put it down.
__label__1 Sudoku is a lot of fun, and what this app does is provide the tools to quickly work through complicated puzzles.  Things like entering a number automatically replace pencil marks for that number, and the ability to steep backward and forward make it much
__label__1 I love this sudoku app! There are soooo many different puzzles at varying levels of difficulty. I also like that it keeps track of your times and gives you different options while playing, such as undo, redo, hints, erase, etc. I wish it had a &#34;start
__label__1 I'm an advance Sudoku player and I love this app. It has different ways for you to play, and has [as stated] more than 10,000 puzzles for you to play! I am constantly on public transportation, including underground where I get no reception, so this game 
__label__1 lots of puzzles! customized settings! several varieties! what more can you ask for? i use this on my kindle fire and it works perfectly every time!
__label__1 If you are looking for a Sudoku game, THIS is the one you want, it has TONS of game variants, TONS of levels endless hours of fun, you won't regret getting this app as I did not, colors and size are excellent.
__label__0 Too hard to figure out how to operate this app and play this simple but challenging game that I have played for years. Two different keyboards (why a zero key?), 6 or 7 other buttons, multiple square colors...come on, give me a break.  Developers need to
__label__1 Love the clock to try to beat my own times.  Good app. if you like sudoku  I would get this app
__label__1 I love this game and so many games!!  From very easy to extremely hard.  I've spent many an hour playing.

__label__1 ...then this is the app for you.  Great features and customization.  I honestly don't know what I could suggest to make it better. I've tried a few others but this app was the clear winner.
__label__1 My (new) favorite sudoku game!  Easy to play, LOTS of games, many levels from very easy to nightmare.  Settings are customizable--I like to keep it in portrait mode. You can also set colors, hints, font size (helpful for older eyes!), etc.  I highly reco
__label__1 This game is really well done!  I'm still on the easy puzzles but some of them could be hard.  When they are hard, the pencil and erase functions are very well done and helpful.  This is a very user friendly game.
__label__1 First, this app has a very modest set of App Permissions. One reviewer reported that he could not use the app without a network connection. I just turned off my WiFi and it is working fine, so either that reviewer made a mistake, or the app has since bee
__label__1 I really like the interface and various options to this sudoku.  Definitely the best one on Android yet, in my opinion.Here's one unique thing you guys did with this that I love, and it's the thing that makes a player get better.  When you click on a num
__label__1 Overall this is a really good Sudoku app with easy controls, simple and elegant graphics, and a mix of easy to hard puzzles. I enjoy playing Sudoku on my phone and have played other versions. This version ranks just as well if not better than the others.
__label__1 Great interface for playing Sudoku. Tons of levels, great game play, I can't think of a single reason not to love it.
__label__1 I think by now most of us are at least familiar with Sudoku. If you've ever played Sudoku this game is guaranteed to please. It takes basic Sudoku and amps it up with a plethora of variants, levels, and features. Personally I find the game of Sudoku to g
__label__0 I love Sudoko. This game however wouldn't download properly on my Kindle Fire HD. I downloaded it 3 times before I gave up.

__label__1 Lots of great features for a sudoku game.The best I've seen yet.Sudoku solving couldn't be easier or more high-tech!
__label__1 This app, as it says, has 10,000+ different puzzles in eight different difficulty levels. Each difficulty has 1,250 different puzzles. The puzzles play smoothly, and load very quickly. Once you choose a puzzle, hit 2 buttons and it's loaded. As everyone

__label__1 Its a pretty awesome game. of course its a little challenging but its a fun game to pass the time.
__label__1 So far I am enjoying this app. Pencilling in numbers makes it easy to keep track of possible answers. Yes.
__label__1 I gave this app five stars because it is a good app.  I just don't like Sudoku.  I thought I would give it another shot since I got my Kindle Fire HD 8.9, but it's still just giving me that &#34;meh&#34; feeling.  I don't think it's fair to downgrade an 
__label__1 This is my favorite sudoku app. It has some great features and a very intuitive interface. Might make the game too easy for some with the default options, but everything is customizable.
__label__1 A very well done app. Its very easy to get around, very intuitive. Its also very easy to cheat but the helps that are there are easy to control.
__label__1 Some Sudoku apps are just hard to use, not even considering the puzzle itself. This one is a joy to play.
__label__1 I have played quite a few different Sudoku games on the PC.  This is my first Sudoku on the Kindle Fire HD. While I have not yet explored all the different types of Sudoku available in this game, the basic gameplay is far superior to any that I have expe
__label__1 Game is very good for those who like this kind of games (and I am one of them). has extensive collection of puzzles and lot of ooptions.
__label__1 Great game for Sudoku fans.  Plenty of levels and games.  I just want to know why there is a minimum number of words required for feed back?
__label__1 I rarely think games are worth more than a dollar. Usually I try to weigh how long a game can remain entertaining (replay value) and how well they are put together and compare that to other games you can play for just as long for a buck. I think you woul
__label__1 On my mid range phone the sudoku laypout is the best i have seen. Open sudoku is my other favorite and this has better layout options for small screens, plus very useful highlighting to help you visualise solutions. Currently my favorite sudoku app.
__label__1 It is nice to Sudoku puzzle at hand for when you are just sitting idle.  It works well, although I have not had much time recently to sit idle.
__label__1 If you like Sudoku then this is a must have game.  The game is professionally designed and is great to play.  The app does include adware but I have not seen any pop up ads so it appears that at the present time they are inactive. This is a repeat FATOD 
__label__1 I like working with numbers better than words and this game has it.  Sometimes it get very hard to figure out.
__label__1 I hope wasted in a good way.  I want to keep my mind sharp and I must say this program keeps me on my toes.  I haven't found any bugs at all.
__label__1 This is a very nicely done app. There are a lot of puzzles and different varieties, so the game never gets old or repetitive.The game board and number entry pads are laid out well and big enough to see and use in either landscape or portrait in a tablet 
__label__1 I installed this on my Samsung Tab 2 and it works great.  A more complete implementation of Sudoku does not exist.  This is &#34;professionally written&#34;.  My hats off to you guys.  And thanks for the wonderful time killer.
__label__1 Simple, clean interface.  Lots of customizability.  Been hoping I could find a good, free sudoku to replace the one I lost when I updated my Nook Tab from stock OS.  Worth the full price - grab it fast while it's free.  And tell your friends!
__label__1 This is the most full featured Sodoku app I've seen.  Lots of puzzles make for days and days of puzzle fun.  Highly recommend to anyone who enjoys sodoku.
__label__1 This is the first app that I've seen that actually makes it possible to do sudokus on the computer - I'm not a fan of writing down every single number in a box, and so have a method that I place numbers in certain places on paper sudokus.  I can't do the

__label__1 I've never tired of Sudoku and have played for about 8 years.  This game gives a sense of achievement and the researchers say it is excellent to keep the dementia away from our brains.
__label__0 The very easy was not easy to do.  Could not do the puzzle filling up 2 blocks.  Not enough numbers given to make you stick with it.
__label__1 I kept working one puzzle after another until I realized I'd been playing for over an hour.  No problems yet.
__label__1 I'm not a Sodoku fanatic, but I do like to play.  This app makes playing so easy and fun.  There are thousands of games that range from very easy to &#34;you'll never figure it out.&#34;  Great for every level of player.  I highly recommend this game.

__label__1 This is the easiest version of Sudoku puzzles I have every  played. I can get done with a puzzle in half the time since it is so easy to pencil in the numbers that could go in the box.

__label__1 I picked this app up a little while back as the FATD.  Not many apps that I get are keepers.  This one is a keeper.I have seen a lot of Sudoku apps and this is by far the best.  I honestly don't think a better app could be created for the game.  Even if

__label__1 With 10,000 puzzles this should keep me happy for quite a while. I have a sudoku on my kindle reader but this one on my kindle fire is much easier on the eyes. I'm still at the very easy level and they are not too easy. There is still a good amount of ch

__label__1 This is the best sudoku app I'v ever used. The entry method is customizable &amp; it lets you enter all your possible numbers in each box. One tiny feature that made it the best in my opinion, was that when you enter a number in a box, it erases that num

__label__1 I can't decide between this and Sudoku4ever (by the same company) as the BEST sudoku game out there for Android. If you like Sudoku programs, get it. It has a wonderful interface and tons of useful features.
__label__0 very disappointed in this one - advertised for kindle, but no mention that it will not work on fire.  So, if you like stuff for a &#34;two generations old&#34; device, go for it.  if you want something you can use today, pass on this baby!
__label__1 I am a huge sudoku fan and this game has more than enough games to keep me busy with multiple levels of challenges. You can save a game and come back into it later or start a different game and save that one also. Great app a definite keeper for me.

__label__1 Great app for those of us who like old movies and tv shows.  Takes you back to a time when this medium was fairly new.
__label__1 This app has some great classic films, but what makes it fabulous are all the old, cheesy horror films. If you love the old horror movies shown on Saturdays years ago by guys dressed up like Dracula, this is the app for you.
__label__1 Watching just one old classic of James Cagney, Edward G. Robinson or Boris Karloff makes this a worthwhile expense. Not to mention Saturday afternoons at the movie house with Charlie Chan or Roy Rogers. There seems to be hundreds of movies available. A m
__label__1 I want to say THANK YOU to the developer of Movie Fault. I love old films, as in old from the 1960's and earlier. An to have this app, coincides with the old time radio app that I have, and I am in heaven. Best $1.99 I have spent!! I love seeing Bela Lug
__label__1 I read another reviewers review that mentioned they had a wpdn 2.0 and that's why I got it. I love that I have old movies to watch on my novel thanks to you!!For 2.00 which is not alot of money some old movies are worth it!!
__label__1 This is a fairly large collection of classic films. Although they are not the best quality they are plentiful. For only $2 it is well worth it.
__label__0 what a disappointment! can't get any movies to play.wasted my money on this. wish I had known before I bought.

__label__1 this . is.  epic. I mean who doesn't love daleks? its a great game, similar to chess.  you shall be exterminated!
__label__1 The game is surprisingly fantastic. Though it wouldn't be worth much more than its current price (99 cents), I think it was definitely a good buy for the dollar. The controls are simple and the game sounds like it should be too and, all things considered
__label__1 As someone who fondly remembers playing Daleks+ on a Macintosh SE, I love this game. It's exactly what I was hoping for. Younger folks used to getting Angry Birds for 99&cent; may complain because they expect more in the way of action and graphics, but t

__label__1 I love this game! You have to actually use your brain in this game, unlike most of the games we have now. With most games today, it's SHOOT EVERYTHING. With this game, it's OUTSMART EVERYTHING! We need more games like this.
__label__1 This game is easy to play and such a simple concept, but it is VERY addictive! 'I would use the word "genius" but I'm in the room'
__label__1 as a whovian inside and out( been watching doctor who since I was little) I was so excited to find this game! I love it and all the fun it has provided! :)

__label__0 In order to really use this app, you must buy the &quot;Full Version&quot; from GOOGLE. Amazon won't allow you to buy the Full Version on the Appstore, and if you buy it from Google Play, you can't play it on the Kindle Fire HD! I love my Fire HD, but, c

__label__1 I love this game it is the best one I have got it is fun and I can never put it down
__label__0 The graphics leave much to be desired, the gameplay is boring at best, the animation even leaves much to be desired. This game is a big snoozer. I could not possibly recommend it less.
__label__1 This game is extremely crule to animals ....its still fun I cant put it down!!!You should get this appBut if you love love LOVE animals don't get it.
__label__0 who ever made this, i want sum1 to do this to u, and don't download this stupid app. i am an animal lover and this is very hurtful.
__label__1 When you have a migraine the last thing you want is having to deal with something complex or glitchy. This app is easy to use and contains all the relevant data you want. I like so much I might buy the pro version.
__label__1 I downloaded two headache apps on the same day. Can't remember the other one. I deleted it less than a day later. Too confusing. This one's simple and helps me quickly track and get on with my life.
__label__1 This diary is great. I look forward to sharing it with my doctor. The fact that you can keep track of possible triggers, severity of pain, medications, etc. is awesome.  This diary has been a blessing!
__label__1 This is one of the first apps I downloaded onto my Kindle Fire and it's by far the most useful.  Headache Diary Pro allows one to record headaches of several different types, at what time he headache started, your point on a pain scale, customizable trig

__label__1 All your news in 1 location.  I use it every single day it's a great app. Now I can't wait for the Kindle fire.
__label__1 Taptu is a great app for following all of your RSS feeds. It's a snap to add any source and organize them any way you like. Very Nice!!
__label__1 Easy to use, good source choices, beautiful on my Kindle Fire.  This is a first look for my special interests every day.  Very good!
__label__1 I was able to add all of the blogs I follow to this, and enjoy using it almost every day.
__label__1 Coming from someone thats  used both Pulse and Taptu for a while, my final verdict is; I like them both!  I use Taptu on my Kindle HD because i find the Pulse version on Kindle to be behind in updates. But Taptu to be very lovely on a bigger screen, with

__label__1 The pictures and sounds make this app a lot of fun for small children.  It's a standard memory game, but you can see care was taken to make this something my son likes to play over and over again.
__label__1 There are multiple levels of the game, from very easy to more difficult and multiple themes. There's a reward a the end when the winner hears a giggle and all the pieces vibrate. The grandchildren enjoy this game.

__label__1 lots of fun. keeps them entertained and helps with memory skills. I love being able to praise them on a job well done.the sounds are fun too!
__label__1 Love this app. My two year old nephew can't get enough of it. It helps his memory skills and keeps him occupied while his big brother does homework.
__label__1 I have been using this app a lot over the last two weeks and haven't seen lewd ads, so maybe they have fixed this problem. In fact, I haven't seen any ads on this app in days. There's just the mini ad at the bottom that says Kids Match'em Free. In fact, 
__label__1 I got this app for my granddaughter, but I'm having so much, it may be hard to give it to her to play!
__label__1 my 2 yr old loves it.  I haven't noticed the ads others did.  I have it on my kindle fire.
__label__1 My 2 year old loves this game and I confess to playing a game or two myself! It is too cute! My little boy loves the fact that the animals make sounds. Just adorable!
__label__1 I have twin 2yr olds and they love it and I love them using a tablet so well. Free is the best price!
__label__1 We just love playing memory as a family! This app allows us to enjoy it on the go! My 3yr old really enjoys it and we feel it is better than typical video game given his. age
__label__1 Excellent memory game thank you! Using for our grandmother who has Alzheimer's. Would even pay for a version that had a bigger selection of icons or themes.
__label__1 My 2 year old daughter loves this app. It is nice as a parent to find a game that she enjoys and can learn from.
__label__1 I love this app. I have so much fun with my grandkids when we play this. Great color. I would recommend this to all!!

__label__1 My 3 year old twin grandsons love this app. We play it daily it has really helped them to concentrate and think ahead for next moves.
__label__1 This app is my sons favorite! He would play this ALL day if I let him. It's great to little ones! I recommend it to EVERYONE!
__label__1 my little one really enjoyed this. he would constantly play. it definitely helped him with his memory skills. now he is better than me! u should get it! :)
__label__1 My 2 1/2 year old loves this game.  It is really simple but that's exactly what I wanted for him.  He quickly learned how to play it and it keeps him busy.  You have your choice of four different themes of cards to match.  i've even played it a bit for &
__label__1 it keeps little one very intertained.  she likes it alot i give this app a A+ ... well i think its great ...
__label__1 I really like this matching game for my 3 year old and 4 year old. I read the other reviews before posting mine and I went back to check the ads. It looks like the ads have been fixed (math website for kids, etc) and they are very small at the bottom of

__label__1 my 2 &amp; 4 year old love this matching game. The sounds are not to loud and the Colors are nice.  Great game especially, since its free my favorite word.
__label__1 This is a classic match game with lovely art work. It does exactly what you would expect it to do.
__label__1 Even though this is a kid's game, I play it all the time when I'm bored - on a plane, waiting somewhere, etc. You can play it with a partner too. Great for all ages and improves memory!
__label__1 My four year old daughter absolutely loves this game.  It really helped her with her memorization skills.  I was amazed and proud when I watched her finally catch on to the game for the first time.  She breezed through it, matching all the animals and fo
__label__1 My boys really like this matching game, particularly the one with the animals as my kids love animals. My oldest always wants to find the lions and keeps playing to the next game and the next to get find the lions. It's fun to watch them play and really 
__label__1 I love the fact that this is a bundled game app.  I like the furry creatures game and the Halloween match game.  I especially like the end of the game when the creatures or matchups jiggle because it gives me such a good feeling!!  I found myself going b
__label__1 love this game!!! helps with memory and learning!!!! we have a blast playing with this app!!! so much fun together
__label__1 One of my two year old sons favorite apps. There are many memory match games in the free apps for little ones but many of them take too much or not enough time,  flipping the cards over,  explaining them,  etc. This one is just perfect. My son does not b
__label__1 My grandkids loved this game over Christmas and my Neice and myself, when my son was two he started playing memory match so I have always introduced it to my grandkids. Thanks for this app!
__label__1 my 2 yr old granddaughter loves this game she doesn't even notice she's learning. she's  just having fun while were waiting.
__label__1 awesome little game,  my 6month old grandson,  luvs this game! And it was free from amazon, that is even better, thanks amazon!!!!
__label__1 My 6 &amp; 3 yr old both love this game. Just downloaded a bunxh of other apps for them, but they insisted on only choosing this one!
__label__1 Great app...perfect for preschool and beyond.  Fun to play as a single player or with a friend!  I have had no problems with it.
__label__1 He loves this thing.  The only thing it would make it better is to change it to teach spelling as well.  Maybe have the animal make sound and say what it is and spell it.  That might be a seperate apps and is only a suggestion.
__label__1 my three year old loves puzzles. and matching games she plays everyday. and is so proud of herslef when she finishes :)
__label__1 The first time my 2 year-old niece tried this game she didn't do very well but before too long she had mastered the concept. Now I have to fight her for the use of my Kindle Fire and we (her mother and I) have been forced to download the app for use on o
__label__1 Little tikes love to play this easy to understand game. simple matching of recognizable cute animals is a great little game fortoddlers and up.
__label__0 Might be good for a 2  yr old but any kid older than that would be bored very fast with this game. Too few tiles on the screen number of match odds too few.
__label__1 My 2yo loves playing this game.  Didn't take her too long to clear her first board.  She really likes the Animal cards.
__label__0 R rated Ads. Wife and son are playing this, up pops some chick w her butt in the air. NOT designd for kids.
__label__1 Motion is very smooth and fast. Sound FX keeps kids interested.  Works great.  As far as apps go it is a simple concept, but they did it very well.
__label__1 My five-year-old daughter loves to play this game. We have had it for over a year now and she still likes it. They have added several new themes since we first got it. I haven't noticed any improper adds while she was playing it. The adds are unobtrusive
__label__1 My 3 yr old grandson loves this app!  It didn't take him long to master this.  He is better at it than I am.  A must have app for every young child.
__label__1 bought this for my 4 and 2 year old. just what you expect. i got it free. i couldn't see paying for a memory game.
__label__1 Great for short attention span kid. My two year old loves it.  Completely worth it. One of the best free kids games so far.
__label__1 a simple game my 4 yr old loves. worth having. keeps her busy.  I like it too. that&apos;s all I have to say_
__label__1 I downloaded this for my almost 3 year old and he loves it. It is a great learning game for him. The animals also make sounds so that is fun too.
__label__1 got this ap for free! My students with special needs can work this game quite easily and get excited when they get a match and are rewarded with a cute sound! This game is a great time killer when you need to entertain a little one for a bit.
__label__1 My granddaughter, 20 months loves this app.  She really enjoys playing this memory game. She loves the different animal sounds.
__label__1 My son still plays this app and I have had it for a very long time.  The different images and colors are fun for him, and he has gotten so good at planning and figuring out the puzzles.
__label__1 my two year old loves this game. I've had it for over a year and she still plays it and has so  much fun with it.
__label__1 this is a great game for my 2yr old. he really likes all the different levels he can enjoy and all of the pictures
__label__1 Evo 4g. Runs great. My 4 yr old and 6 yr old love it. Filling out the word minimum. Spatula
__label__1 When my children were younger we had the actual games . Never failed that pieces were lost and the kids were done with it.
__label__1 My 6-year-old grandson and I love taking turns, trying to remember the place where each tile is hiding.  We don't keep score, but just have fun solving the whole puzzle.  There are several different sets of pictures, so the game stays fresh and fun.
__label__1 My four year old son loves to play this game. he enjoys the silly sounds and the way it encourages him to find the matches.
__label__1 this has been fun for the kids and adults in our house.  we love it!  love how the season cards change!
__label__1 My daughter loves this game. If she can get her hands on the Kindle, she will usually find and play this game. She is pretty good at it as well.
__label__1 I have always loved programming in BASIC, and now I can do it on my tablet!  I have yet to use it allI would like, but I have only one complaint: it gets flagged as malware by nearly every scanning app there is.However, none of them can tell me what the

__label__1 For a child of the 1980's like myself, finding a BASIC interpreter for the KINDLE FIRE is like finding a long-lost friend who now has SQL connectivity.

__label__0 It was quite strange and very disappointing in my eyes. I do not think it has any point to it and is, in my words, boring.
__label__0 It's kinda like the magic 8 balls... you can tell that it's stupid and I don't like it. I scanned myself and it was like HIGH risk of me being a zombie. I deleted it, if you can't tell.
__label__0 so I scanned in my backyard, and I got an 80% chance of being attacked. Then I did it in the exact place then I got an 8% chance, now I know this isn't real, but at least have it sense you when you move.and also, you should have a radar and your in the m
__label__0 I just bought this game for my kindle and you cant even see anything it is just a blank white screen. would not recommend this game for people with a kindle fire. Really disappointed. :(
__label__0 Yawn
__label__0 For some reason, the voice sounded weird, I don't know why.  It just did not meet my needs, but I guess it's an okay app.
__label__1 I'm 13and I love shut up it is a nice way to tell my bro to shut up so I won't get in trouble
__label__0 The other reviews say this is funny and amusing, but I really disagree. I think that shut up is really kind of rude to say and there are much nicer ways to get your point across. Why would you take the time to get your kindle and load the app just to tel
__label__1 It is great the kids get a kick out of it if they start fighting I use it and they start laughing right away love it
__label__1 But it does exactly as it says it does! It is useful at times, it's to the point and gets the message across.Turn the volume down so it can just be heard, and use it in public while it's in your pocket, and watch others expression when they hear it but c
__label__0 Not even sure why this app exists. My kids downloaded it, but would prefer not to have things like this on our Kindles.
__label__1 I l o v e this app but it needs more!!!!!!!!!!!!!! But it still is fun really really fun when my sister yells at me
__label__1 ummm....first off, nikki warmhead or whatever your name is, this isn't a game. its for info.on that note, this is by far the most up to date and immediate wrestling news source. whether its TNA or WWE this app gives you instant and constant updates.
__label__1 I forgot about  downloading this app and now I have completed that srep this app rules as well I will enjoy it for a long time
__label__1 Great source for all news dealing with prowrestling whether it be wwe, tna, Rob, etc. a all around great source for news
__label__1 I'm a huge fan of wwe,tna, and roh so this is the best app for me.I like to check on the champions the most. Jeff hardy needs to be champ
__label__1 WWE IS AWSOME I READY TO SEE BLOOD ON THE MAT I LIKE HULK HOGON MY GRANDMA AND GRANDPA HAD A HULK HOGON ACTION FIGURE OF HIM EVERY TIME I GO OVER THERE I WOULD FIND HULK HOGON
__label__0 this app by far is the worst I played in like 5 years! and that's really really hard 2 get from me because I'm a huge I repeat HUGE wwe fan and by all my 2 favorite wwe superstars is the undertaker and randy orton!
__label__1 PW Torch is one of my favorite apps, being I'm a pro wrestling fan. It is always up on the latest news and stories in all the professional wrestling ranks. Matches are covered and reviewed with accuracy. Upcoming events are publicized, as are blogs, yout
__label__0 I think this app is for people who either can hack into the stupid game and make it WAY better. My mom gets about a thousand emails about apps  being downloaded. Just another thing to help you get grounded. It gives you like 2  second to order the number
__label__1 This app is great. Your brain age isn't spot on, but it is pretty accurate. When it says &quot;you are using _____% of your brain&quot; that is because not all of your brain is used in this type of test! It keeps your reflexes sharp at the least, and it 
__label__1 this is great I got the best brain age in history it said so I believe you should get it and see if you can get better than minep.s. it will tell u when u do of u do
__label__0 This game was not for me!! I have better games to play than this one! You can tell that some person that was BORED created this app!!
__label__1 This is a fun game for the whole family to play just to see what you get when playing it.
__label__0 It's telling me I have a 50 year old brain, and I'm only 10! All's it does is shove  numbers in your face, then tell you to press the circles in the correct order. And you only have 2 seconds to look at them. Whoever wrote a good  review is crazy and has
__label__1 Very challenging self improvement game. I enjoy making strides to improve my abilities and find it entertaining. I would recommend this to anyone who likes to test his intellectual ability.
__label__1 I got addicted to this game and eked up 31 yes!! so u need to by this it is solo cool
__label__1 This test really needs quite and consendtration. I really enjoyed doing it especially when it said my brain was about 10 years younger than I really am. Ha
__label__0 I would give it a -99947373899777566292837757574738293857379998847474747489 stars if I could. I am ten years old and it told that my brain was working at 1.29% and that it is 120 years old! This is NOT a fun game and I REALLY don't recommend it!
__label__1 I think knowing the size of my brain is cool I play brain age test all the time so cool
__label__1 1star people don't know what they are talking about. they just say that because they get bad ages. anyway this game is GREAT and is a good app.  &bull;_&bull;
__label__0 This app is crazy!!! It told me my brain was 116 years old.I AM ONLY TEN!!! Got that trustmobtech? Do not buy!!!! If you do you will regeret it!!!!!! I wish I could rate this app 0 stars.
__label__0 this app is HORRIBLE it told me that i was 115 years 1 motth and 1 day old do not get
__label__0 this is the most stupid game in the app store. SUPID STUPID GAME NOW I DONT TRUST TUE COMPANY TRUSTMOBTECH ANY MORE WOW LAUGB OUT LOUD S9OOOOO STUPID.
__label__0 This is an absolutely ridiculous app! I'm 13 years old and the app said my brain is 116 years old. I am not that old and this game is just retarded! I DO NOT recommend this app. I would give it 0 stars but the lowest you can give is 1.
__label__0 please don't buy this app. I know its free,  but it is very stupid. it only gives you like 2 seconds to read 9 numbers!!!!!! plus the app picture is so gross.  I had to uninstall because it was so bad. the brain age is probably fake. don't buy an app thi
__label__1 its able to teach people how to play guitar or even electric guitar like myself. its really great but it takes time and patience.
__label__1 Like how it shows you how to hold the guitar, the pick, etc. I am brand new at playing guitar, just got one a few weeks ago and I am no expert so if there is someone with more knowledge they may think otherwise, but as a total novice, I have enjoyed usin
__label__1 I'm just learning guitar and this app is great. I like that it shows you beginner guitar tabs and songs.
__label__1 Great app!  Helped me out a lot, and I even learned enough from the app to apply to other songs and further my guitar skills.
__label__1 Love it!  Fun, challenging.  There are many levels to complete.  In the beginning, they are easy, but get MUCh harder
__label__0 The game just gives you a graph, and you need to find a Hamiltonian path.  It's really boring, and the interface just isn't great.  Avoid this game.
__label__1 this is fun and a challenge.  It is like solving a puzzle but better because it lights up and you can see right away if you a right.
__label__1 I believe there are 280 games total, and you can only advance once you finish the one you are presently working on. This game is a great brain exercise, and something to do when you need to pass time. It also won't be quick to finish, so you can rest ass
__label__1 This is one I play a few times just about every night.  When you make a mistake it screams at you . . . funny.  Quite enjoyable game and I'm glad I got it.
__label__1 This is a collection of puzzles that you have to draw without picking up the pencil or retracing a line. Some are quite challenging.  It is a good game that you can play for a few minutes while waiting for an appointment or for longer times.  Works great
__label__1 I HAVE TRIED THIS 3 TIMES SO FAR AND IT IS A FUN,MIND USING APP. NOT DIFFICULT AND EASY TO PLAY. NOT FRUSTRATING,EASY TO LEARN AND LOTS OF PUZZLES.  THE NEON EFFECTS ADDS A LITTLE BIT TO THE GAME.A GOOD,FUN,EASY GAME TO PLAY WITH...CAN EASILY BE A 2 PLAY
__label__0 This looked like a lot of fun, but the instructions and directions are very weak. It ckuld be much better if the developers would clearly offer some strong instrucgions and help, but right now, it's just not worth it.
__label__1 Great game, the kids love it and so do I, good mind workout for all of us keep up the good work
__label__1 THE KIDS REALLY ENJOY THIS GAME. IT IS DIFFERENT AND CHALLENGING. FELT IT NEEDED A FEW MORE INSTRUCTIONS BUT ONCE THEY FIGURED IT OUT THEY LOVED IT.
__label__1 I got no complaints except I would have preferred the undo button on the main screen.  It's challenging and it builds up.  First impression of the game is good.
__label__1 Fun and challenging. I really enjoy playing it to pass the time. The puzzles get more and more challenging the further into the levels you get.
__label__1 Sometimes the screens are easy, others really make you stop and think. Great game. I keep going back to it to play. I really enjoy it.
__label__1 Much fun we play this a lot...great time waster.Getting a little tired of it though.Can't really say much else.
__label__1 This is a really fun game! Some of the puzzles can be hard but they really make you think and work hard to finish them! I would recommend this game to all!
__label__1 I only got this but I look forward to trying to solve more of the Puzzles.I have only played a few levels but it was a lot of fun.
__label__1 Most puzzles in this game are pretty intuitive for me (as in I don't have to think about it much, but can see right off where to start and what direction to go.  Every once in a while there will be a hard one that takes longer to think about.My kids (of 
__label__1 This game is simple, period. Don't expect 3D images, music or great sound effects. This is a simple, but smart and well designed game that fits its purpose. I have been playing it two days so far and I have not get bored while I have had the time to play
__label__1 This is a fun and easy game.Each level has an array of dots with lines connecting in various configurations.  Your job is to light up every edge by moving from dot to dot.  If you get every edge lit, you win the level, and if you get stuck on a dot with 
__label__1 I play this constantly. I am on puzzle 224 already. My mind gets a work out with this game.  I like being able to solve the puzzle as fast as I can. I am still in classic puzzle mode so I am hoping the next level will time you on how fast you solve the p
__label__0 Not quite sure what the point of this app was.  It was really boring and seemed really pointless.  Don't waste your time
__label__1 Challenging and different from a lot of this type of game.  Makes u think and figure different ways of accomplishing the game.
__label__1 I really enjoy playing this game, it makes you use your brain, not like a lot of other games where you know what to do automatically - this one makes you think a few moves ahead in the game.  Yes, it is a bit like connect the dots, but it's not and it's 
__label__1 I love this game really exercises your brain. I love this game but i have completed all levels. WhereIs the update? Or new puzzles ..im waiting!! Lol
__label__1 I have been enjoying this app.  I guess it really depends on what kind of puzzle games you like.  For me, this one is relaxing.  I really don't mind not having any music in the background.  I usually keep the sound down on games anyway.  I like the tap f
__label__1 So much fun.  Absolutely fascinating. Lots of fun seeing what kind of designs we can make running finger over screen or tapping the screen.  Can't believe it's free.
__label__1 Love this game but can be frustrating in the higher levels. Definitely keeps you &#34;on your toes&#34;. Addicting to play.
__label__1 I love apps that you think and work the noggin instead of swiping the screen like a maniac. While the graphics are nothing mind blowing it gets the job done. More importantly it's about solving puzzles and there are enough here to keep you buzy for awhil
__label__0 This game is just plain boring. Might be OK for kids who are learning shapes and such, but much too easy for adults.
__label__1 I put this on my kindle fire and I enjoy this game a lot.  You get started and then you just want to keep trying to get farther.
__label__1 I love this game. Most of the screens are challenging and you aren't tied up for a long time playing a game.
__label__1 This is a fun and entertaining game. I can spend many hours playing this game, it is a lot of fun.
__label__1 oh this is a fun timed game where you have to move the cats into the house from the field--lots of fun ! offers several fun levels--very enjoyable.
__label__1 This app works perfectly! And the devotional is excellent! Anything billy gram makes is outstanding and this man deserves the up most respect!
__label__1 I always loved to hear and read Billy Grahams messages. This Devotional is short and to the point. I enjoy it very much.
__label__0 So far this app will not install on my Nextbook 7s which is an android 4. I would love to be able to use it. Billy Graham is probably the greatest preacher of all time. Hopefully there will be an update soon.
__label__0 This program never downloaded.  I tried several times and have not been able to get it to download so I have been very disappointed in not being able to view the app.
__label__0 I have not been able to download it . It would be a great app because I have it on my phone & I love it.
__label__1 Great game could play forever however loses something in the carry over to the kindle why I don't know but its a little different then the computer game that we all know and love
__label__0 This app is not what I was expecting it to be. I could make myself keep it and it really seems to be lacking. Should really remake it and try to keep it simple like the original Dope Wars.
__label__0 Worst remake I've ever seen of this game. Idiotic attempt at this game. garbage game from an amateur out to try and make a cheap buck and an insult to the original game.
__label__1 This pizza app was easy to download and install. It contains all the local pizza places and connect you to their order site.
__label__0 this waste of time is not an app at all. It just directs you to a web page which as far as I can tell does absolutely nothing at all. FAIL.
__label__0 Not too many coupons available in my area...kinda disappointed....hopefully they will change and more will become available in the future.
__label__0 This is not a pizza app.  I installed it based on it's claim to be from Papa Johns.  All it does is take you to a web page with coupons.
__label__0 Pretty useless app I downloaded by accident while looking for the actual dominos app.  Doesn't do anything.  Get the dominos app instead.
__label__1 I order dominoes pizza often and the app works just fine.check it out yourself and see
__label__1 I order dominoes online and this saves time having to log on my computer.  I can just sit with my kindle and order.
__label__0 This is not a great app. You can do better without it.I've already deleted it from my device. Too many steps required.
__label__0 I just can not figure out how this app works. I often play Siduco on a hand held game. But cannot eve complete the first game here. I would not buy again nor recommend it.
__label__1 Downloaded free to one and the paid version to the other. Both  are very similar. Hundreds of games to play with several levels. An endless source of entertainment.
__label__1 My husband is a former math teacher, and he really enjoys suduko.  I wasn't sure he would like the Kindle version of suduko, however he spends hours working on Kindle 's suduko.  I highly recommend it.  Amy
__label__0 The directions for this game are difficult to figure out.  I have given up trying. Give me paper and pencil instead.
__label__1 Sudoku is one of the most challenging games I've every done.  I play it almost every day and am getting pretty good at it too.
__label__1 I rate this game to the highest!!  Anyone that love numbers and puzzles will truly love this one.  Have fun with Sudoku!!
__label__1 I play Sudoku in my own time and the competition is one on one ME against ME. I've had three or more Sudoku games loaded on my Android pad for months and they all have their good and bad points; playing all of them and grading them head to head this game
__label__1 Very easy to play and user friendly. Numbers that are no longer in play are not illuminated and that is a plus in my opinion.
__label__1 My wife plays this all the darn time on her phone. I had put several Sodoku games on her phone (SG3) and she said this one was the best by far. She really liked it and when I told her we should get the paid one she said "Don't need that, I don't mind the
__label__1 Simple and straight forward.  It only plays in portrait though and that makes it hard to hold.  Don't improve  it too much, pleses
__label__1 I absolutely love this color version on my Kindle Fire! Many levels/games to play! Could not be happier!! Would recommend this game to all my friends!!!
__label__1 Love Sudoku. It keeps my mind nimble and sharp. Have it on my home computer in various versions. So happy to be able to take it with me now!
__label__0 Though well intended, the game does not function correctly.  I can not fill in the possibilities, and sometimes cannot get rid of the small numbers in the blocks.  This is a waste of time! I would not recommend that anyone purchase this game.
__label__1 I am enjoying Sudoku very much.  This app is easy to use and works very well.  Glad to have the app on my Kindle.
__label__1 Any game by AI factory works well on the Kindle Fire HD. I buy them all because they work and are beautifully designed. These are just the best time wasters around. This Sudoku has great features that make playing much more exciting and there are more ga
__label__1 I play this several times a day when I was some fun brain stimulation.  I highly recommend this one to all Sudoku fans.
__label__1 This is a favorite game of mine and my husband as well..will get lots of use out of this game I am sure.
__label__0 If you have the time to waste and have no capacity to regret the misuse of this life's most valuable non-renewable resource, then perhaps this is your app.
__label__1 This is a fun game.  I have always liked sudoku puzzles.  Great way to pass the time and use your head.
__label__0 In school I was never really good at math so I didn't expect I would like this game, but I got b/c a friend recommended it to me.  I tried it for about a week and couldn't even complete the first puzzle.  This game needs a puzzle help option where you ca

__label__1 This version is user-friendly and intuitive to operate.  If you accidentally put two of the same number in a row, column, or box, it will light up orange to indicate an error.  Otherwise, the number you type in lights up blue.  If you are a sudoku fan, t
__label__1 I love Sudoku, and this is one of the best apps for the game I have seen.  It has different levels and at least 300 games for each level.  You can also re-play games to improve time/score.Very good app!

__label__1 love it love it.  i am dyslexic and this was on the list of puzzles to work on to keep the dyslexia at bay.
__label__1 I love Sudoku and have used books for years, but this edition for my Kindle Fire HD is just awesome. I especially love the ease with which you can enter or delete numbers in a certain square. I would recommend this to all Kindle Fire HD owners.
__label__1 This is a really good sudoku.  Easy to navigate.  Easy to correct.One thing I really like is that if you select a 2, all the twos on the board light up: makes it easier to see the number patterns.Good for side-by-side play, too.  My Mom and I play this g
__label__1 The ability to try a guess when you are stumped, and the ability to enter different simultaneous possibilities for a particular cell are great.  Being able to erase, back-up, and save a game for re-play later are all a plus.
__label__1 Within the game package is a lot of games, 300 per each of the four levels. I am working the easy set now but am gaining confidence in moving up to level 2
__label__1 Great game. this is addicting. Love the numbers and the hints. would recommend this one to everyone. Get those brains working!
__label__1 I like this version of Sudoku for Kindle Fire.  It is easy to use and very fun.  I am impressed with AI Factory's work.
__label__0 My true advice don't waste your time!!!! Like so many of Amazons crap!!! I'm being totally sincere when writing this. Plz don't take this review the wrong way. Just as it is written. "Just a Willow in the Wind" Doc Craver :-)
__label__0 I read that it costs money to send SMS messages, plus I do not understand why a greeting card app needs so many permissions.  Would like a dev to explain, or minimize permissions... and allow free sms.
__label__1 Easy sending for every day situations and  reasons. I was able to reach out to all my family & friends to cheer them up, or congradulate, or send  get well  notes...  I miss using this app..
__label__1 love this app! have Kfire,works great and easy to use. send them to everybody for everything! hope there will be updates for more(free) cards!  Please,more kinds of cards!!!!
__label__0 my aunt &amp; i share the same birthday...so...i need to send her a birthday card...when I found this  but when i started the installation /download process...i received an error message that said:&quot;3D animated greeting card app has been corrupted an
__label__0 Didn't work very well if at all. It was hard tosend and even harder to figure out after awhile.I gave up after several tries.  I got a far moresimpler app with less promises and it wasgreat.
__label__1 Different versions of solitaire. A game for any card player. A very satisfying play. Hope you enjoy as much as I have!
__label__1 Who doesn't love solitaire? Easy to load to your Kindle; you'll be playing right away. It was free. What's not to like?
__label__0 Can't figure the game out.for nothing. I am a solitaire player and love to play different ones but forget this one.
__label__0 All the pictures of the cards show the numbers on the card.  But when you attempt to play the cards only have the value of the cards in the corners and the suit icon in the middle.  Hard to see the values.
__label__0 This product does not work at all. If you try to move a card the only place it goes is into the free cells. It is a non starter-avoid it.
__label__0 I am lookin for more graphics n this is very simple.  Will keep looking.6 more words are required for submission
__label__1 easy to use. Just the perfect variety of games. not cluttered with games I don't like. Just has the ones I love to play. Works great.
__label__1 I like to play solitaire because its a game to chanellenge your mine.Yes I would recommend this game. And the reason why is because its a nice relaxing game to play
__label__0 This free app was a disaster--I was under the impression that there was more than one version of solitaire, and I couldn't find any, and there is no solution to a bad game.  I came up against a dead end and the game just sat there and did nothing, no war
__label__1 so far so good. it has four card games instead of one. I have this same app on my cell phone.
__label__1 Like this app a whole bunch. Easy to navigate through. Graphics are great. App works well on the Kindle Fire.
__label__1 This app. Is best suited for the veiwer who wants news and weather updates quick and percise. I use it every morning before Ileave my home. I do not find the traffic component very useful. A less confusing upgrade is needed.
__label__1 This is the best local news app I have and the although it can be a little fuzzy at times the Live Stream is very dependable and gives you the exact times it will be on.
__label__1 Fox 45 covers local news very thorough and they are complimented by nation news by the Fox News National parent outlet.
__label__1 Love fox45 news, gives me latest stories on my kindle! Wished they had more local news apps on android app store!
__label__1 When i watch news, this local Baltimore, tv station is one of my favorites. They give quality news and weather, i watch them everyday on tv or my tablet and their app has worked very well on my 9&#34;Zto Tablet and my 7&#34;Matricom Tablet. I will keep t
__label__1 I like being able to check on the news from a source I trust and one that seems to be &#34;right on it&#34;.  They have the very best weatherman, honestly.  He doesn't bore you to death or drone on.  He truly makes you smile and I love his interaction wi
__label__0 not what I thought it was. just like the previous rating. should be more to it and less of the advertising
__label__1 I only watch WSYX ABC6 because they give the most honest news. I like the news and weather people. I think thhey enjoy what they are doing.
__label__1 This app works great.  Keeps me informed quickly.  I like to check apps in morning and evening for many items.This app fits my ideals and views, and is very easy to read and I love it.
__label__1 Fits galaxy tab screen. Pretty basic but glad they made it. Has videos, blogs and photis. Readable ad free content.
__label__1 Very interesting topics, especially the ones not found in the news.a good place to find out what is going on the world
__label__1 This is probably my favorite news app. It gets updated often - you never have to read stale news - and they really get in depth covering all sides of all issues. Politico is not afraid to go after both sides unlike the Huffington Post which attacks mainl
__label__1 This app is great.  I've become a news/opinion junkie with this app.  It's a snapshot of timely issues and opinions.
__label__1 This app is just wonderful. It gives you a quick headline. You may go to a more in-depth article if you choose. A great quick way to keep up on current events.
__label__1 Superior political news source even if the app seems a tad bland -- there is no modern glitz (not altogether a bad thing) usually have to update manually, but that is a small price to pay for solid perspective and well-written news and an app that doesn'
__label__0 Slow app and does not update. questionable reporting at best and hack jobs for left at worst. I dont recommend it at all.
__label__0 Uninstalled.  It requires too much potentially sensitive information for it to run.  It would be nice if it worked without needing access beyond the internet. Too bad.
__label__1 Keeping it real, this review is only for the app itself. Works great, loads fast, never freezes. Can't really complain about it.
__label__1 Great app to have,  just love the up to date information about political situations and what is happening in the world today.
__label__1 This is a dead on game play reporter of the D.C. follies from POTUS, allies and Congress Critters.  They don't pull punches and are dead on and usually 3-14 days ahead of what gets reported as 'current news'.
__label__1 Having practiced reflexology for many years I jumped at the chance to get an app like this on my fire. It's helpful to have acupressure right at my fingertips so to speak.
__label__1 love this product..it is soooo easy to use. you cant go wrong with it whether use know about acupressure or not
__label__0 amateurish at best.........................young people might be sparked into learning about it, but the methodology exhibited is not relevant or pertinent to anyone seriously contemplating the use of acupressure
__label__1 A very good app that has many versions of physical massage to applyon everyday problems like leg pain, headaches etc.  I highly recommendalso wish they would do one for feet
__label__1 I use this app several times a week for backache - have also had great relief using it for headache,  wrist pain and toothache.  I would rather use this than pop pills!
__label__1 Best app yet. Easy download. Good instructions and got good results. Most pleased with this app. Buy this app. It will not disappoint.
__label__0 for some reason this book didnt download and because i am new to this kindle thing I dont know what to do about it
__label__0 maybe to much information for the lay person .  to hard to figure out exactly where to press c could be dangerous.
__label__1 I've had this app for at least a year. Still have it on my phone and still refer to it frequently for various techniques and have recommended to others. Money well spent. Good value.
__label__0 I tried some of the procedures it recommend to relieve a headache but apparently I didn't do it right. I ended up with a migraine that lasted for 2 days.I also noticed the same procedures and pressure points were recommended for various conditions. Not r
__label__1 This is very interesting and I am trying to use some of the points displayed.  Not sure if it is working but trying!
__label__1 This stuff really works I use it all the time and it helps relieve the pain I have from a chronic medical condition.  I recommend to try it before pills.
__label__1 This app is awesome.  Just aboout everything you need to help you feel better.  You will not be disappointed ;)
__label__1 As I get older and have more and more pain, this is a good source to go to for help.  I would suggest anyone with pain to order this.  It certainly helps.
__label__0 I tired this but didn't not see any proof of pain relief. Maybe you have to think it will magically heal you?
__label__1 works well and I don't know if its really ancient or not but instead of donating to Africa, I selfishly bought this for my own desires hshshahaha!!!!! WIN'!!!!!!!
__label__1 It has worked for me with minor aches and pains.  I really didn't believe that it would work but it did and I use it often.
__label__0 Accupressure is not effective for treating heart attack, urinary problems, liver disease, very high fever or any of the other medical conditions this app claims to treat. If you have a medical condition, see a doctor to get an accurate diagnosis and effe
__label__1 Good for massage therapist and manicurist who need to massage people with tension . I have resorted to this a few times
__label__1 This app has saved me untold pain and freed me from pain meds. I have used it for headaches, carpal tunnel, tennis elbow and many other things. It's my first line of action when something starts to hurt. The instructions and diagrams are easy to understa
__label__1 just downloaded this a few minutes ago, and in all seriousness have begun to feel the positive effects. I have drastically reduced pain in the areas I treated, and that was only in the first 10 minutes after treatment. great app, will definitely use freq
__label__1 I really like this app... I have many books that are now in the form of an app, and this goes right with them. Everyone need this app if they are in to reflexology!
__label__0 I don't think this was working correctly, as I had a hard time getting to the scene.  We really enjoyAnimal Hide and Seek: Free Hidden Object Game for Kidsand since this app didn't seem an improvement, I uninstalled.  Would like to see more "hide and see
__label__0 My granddaughter Loved this... until I bought it.  Now &quot;Hoppo&quot; won't hide after just 2 plays no matter HOW you shake my fire.  And believe me, everyone 's given it a try.  Please fix.  More simple preschooler apps would be welcome, too.  Just m
__label__0 I got this app to help me with my coding class. I wanted to see if it would code correctly before I took one of my test and looked up a code I had the answer to, this app gave me the code "302.4" when i needed code "304.21". This app was a wast of money 
__label__1 I work for healthcare, and we used to get icd9 and cpt code books yearly, but haven't received them for 7 yrs because of the cost. This is great as an app and I need this to do my work correctly in building cases.
__label__1 therapist as a profession and we need these codes daily to diagnose and bill for services. easy to use as well
__label__1 Handy for anyone to have handy, when they want to know what their health care provider is actually charging your insurance company for.
__label__1 it has everything dont have to lug my books everywhere now it helps alot study anywhere now thanks tina c
__label__1 Being a nurse and using ICD-9 code s for all the labs that we do, this makes my work life so simple just type in what you are looking, there is the code. So much better than trying to find it in the ICD 9 code book. Takes longer to fill out the labs form
__label__1 It's like pocket magic but better. This unique game style will leave you addicted! And don't cry if it doesn't work on your crappy low end phone! aka lg optimus
__label__0 Very glitchy. The image was upside down! In the beginning, it was fine. It started upright but when it started to explain how to play the game, it flipped upside down. So I flipped my kindle upside down and continued to play. But after a couple turns, it
__label__0 I didn't even bother making a character after multiple reboots i didn't find it worth the effort to pick a name and then tell me the name had been picked and start a freeze up.  I Might have liked it but the glitches even before actual game play ruined i
__label__1 this app is great the book haves a lot of information, is good for people who want to know more.
__label__1 Terrific
__label__1 The Bible Scholar Set 1 of 2 is very informative as well educationally. Brings new insights to the Holy Bible, very easy to understand and follow. Non - confusing, provieds clarification on points that seem hard to understand. Easy to read and follow, ma
__label__1 I love this app because of the way they explain the books of the bible and is great for someone new who wants to know more about the Christian life.
__label__1 Great way to help study the Bible.  With Set 1 they make a  way of referencing the Bible.  I use them often.
__label__1 Terrific 2
__label__0 this does not do what is supposed to do. it is totally useless, if itworked it would be a good study tool.
__label__1 The Bible SCHOLAR SET: As I learned the 2nd voulme is a must "Have to complete a 2 volume set". This 2nd volume is just as fastinating and accurate as the first volume. If you are planning a Bible study class, "I discovered that the  2nd volume 'opened u
__label__1 This is what will make DVD/BluRay obsolete and I welcome it!Great interface (as you probably already know if you are a Plex user).  If you don't know plex, google it and set it up on your home desktop first.  Then all of the movies, music and home videos
__label__1 must buy for anyone wanting to play your own content on you android device. easy setup, great interface , and remote access
__label__1 We run our own media server at home. It's nice to be able to take it with us when we travel. I can watch a show from the kindle fire while I'm in Washington, California, or Canada. All I need is an internet connection and my account allows me to view and
__label__1 I bought this for my HDX 8.9 Tablet and I am very happy with it. Still investigating all the features it has but so far no problems.
__label__1 it is great to be able to watch my videos from my home computer anywhere I go.  also there is a roku version for the living room tv.  my only problem is the server software is more friendly with Mac over Windows for the extra plugins.
__label__1 Best way to stream local media on your network!
__label__1 This app works great for my Kindle Fire HD. I never experience any of the complains that some of the Kindle Fire HD reviewer left for this app. It could be that it was already fixed when I downloaded this app.
__label__1 I love this app.  It allows me to stream 720p movies from my home server to my Motorola Atrix, Asus Transformer and Nook Color with an interface that easy enough for my wife and kids to use.  I even use plex with my google tv.  When I am on wifi, video n
__label__0 Amazon should remove the Kindle Fire from their list of compatible apps and refund Fire users. Barely works and when it does, it doesn't work well.
__label__0 Why download this when you MUST have plex installed on every device?  Just download a dlna renderer-same concept but NO LIMITATIONS LIKE PLEX.  Crap app.
__label__1 I set up my server, set-up Punisher: War Zone, and then enjoyed the cheese-fest from the comfort of bed on my Kindle Fire HDX.  There was no loss in quality; sound didn't skip and I could see everything clear as day.  The app did crash once, but only onc
__label__1 I had trouble port forwarding my server, but once I figured it out, this app became awesome.  All of my movies (200+) on my Kindle anytime, anywhere.
__label__1 Now that it's no longer an issue, and you get can get it for free for the next 2 nights, why not try it out? It's definitely worth it!
__label__1 My new favorite app! I got lucky and found this when the Amazon App store had it for free. Took just a little tinkering to get it to play well with my firewall, but once that was straightened out, it's been smooth sailing. I'm able to stream movies & epi
__label__1 This app is the perfect add-on to a Plex server. From this app you can access everything that is available on your Plex server from anywhere. It doesn't matter if you phone doesn't support the original media type as the server will transcode the media as
__label__1 This is not only one of the most amazing apps I have, it is also my favorite app for my Roku streaming box.  I've converted my entire DVD collection to mp4 files.  While it took longer and was more involved than when I i-podded my music and got rid of CD
__label__1 Excellent app gives easy access to your Plex server allowing you to stream to your handset or indeed to cast the content to your Chromecast connected TV.
__label__1 This program (the Plex system), is simply one of my favorite, useful pieces of software..  Use this with the plex media server, and you are set.
__label__0 video lags, plays catch up or loads forever. probably one the worst app for streaming movies on kindle fire. why plex, why?until a major update comes out I would try Emit instead.
__label__0 besides being confusing to use, amazon-developer do not offer the refund option, not rven for a second. wished could have tried before purchasing.
__label__1 The UI is great. The app is very intuitive. Connects pretty fast regardless of if on WiFi or LTE. I have been using it for just 15 mins., and i like it already. I do not expect anything bad to happen. I recommend it.
__label__0 I downloaded and installed this on a pretty clean Windows 7 64 bit system, and the server app didn't even launch.  Pretty bad, and I'm pretty unhappy with this cruddy program.  I wasted the $5.Don't waste your money if you have Windows 7.
__label__1 Plex is an outstanding solution for people looking to host their own media server with access available to other networked devices in their homes.  I use it to stream movies to smartphones, tablets, and gaming consoles. This app allows me to do the same 
__label__1 I was looking for an app to help me play my content on the Fire TV and now I use this for all my streaming needs.
__label__1 I have this installed on an IPad 3 and a Amazon Kindle. Works perfectly once you set up the host PC.
__label__1 I love Plex for Android.  It is a free app. but you must secure with a credit card.  If you already have a Plex account it is easier to connect the two.
__label__1 I use this all the time when on business trips. I also use the desktop client on my laptop. It does require the use of a server installed on your host machine that holds movies /music. One thing I don't like is the very short buffer time. I believe it sh
__label__1 You can install Plex on your pc or mac and then have it stream your videos to your Phone, Roku, Xbox, or PC.  This is a great free media server.  I used to pay to have one and now I use this one and it is very nice.  It also finds the cover art and text 
__label__1 With Plex now I can stream all my movies to the big TV in the living room using Chromecast!  Works perfectly.  Just make sure your wifi is strong enough.
__label__1 Just perfect. Had plex for the roku and my xbox, keeps everything nicely organized, pretty looking UI, and is even more awesome with this app. Just get it, you will not be disappointed. 5/5 and well deserved.
__label__1 Perfect companion on my mobile device for Plex Media Server!! Very convenient to manipulate/watch my home video collection and I highly recommend it to anyone.
__label__1 This is what you need to play your movies and TV shows. I dont think anything else comes as close to how nice Plex is.
__label__1 I love this app, it allows me to wirelessly stream anything from my pc to my ROKU and my Kindle Fire HDX tablet. works perfectly.
__label__0 The windows server for this app is slow in all respects. The app also couldn't communicate with the server. Don't buy!
__label__1 Love this app. plays all my movies and music. you can even add items from websites. works well on Fire HD but not on Fire HDX as of this post.
__label__1 Over the years I have trod to implement Windows media server with at best mediocre success.  Plexus installed and impressively. ran with little effort on my part.
__label__1 Works great and comes with a beautiful UI.
__label__1 This Plex application is presently the best application by far that  I've found which allows sharing all of ones main computer media with a  Kindle Fire HD. A 80% discount is offered at this time on its purchase price.
__label__1 The app works wonderfully, if you've used plex before it works as well as you could hope for on the Amazon Fire TV
__label__1 I've been using Plex for awhile now on my pc and Roku player, but decided to give it a go on the new kindle fire HD. I love the responsiveness and speed off it and how clear it is as well. Totally worth the cost.
__label__1 This app is kind of like Post-It notes - what the heck did we do before this?!  Lived in the stone age?  I'm able to access my media collection while traveling, at work, vacation - anyplace. Great quality (configurable, too).  Strongly recommend Plex for
__label__0 The Plex app is the front-end interface to the Plex server, which YOU host on your own server that contains the media files. The Plex server have a feature called &#34;Recently Added&#34; list. The idea is that when you add a new media files (video or au
__label__1 To have the ability to access your media content stored on your computer on my Fire HDX from anywhere in my house is NICE.  I am very pleased with it.
__label__1 This is a great client for the Plex Media Server.  You install it on a computer and point it at your media and it streams the videos to any connected client, locally or over the web.  Super easy to set up, super easy to use. Auto fills the meta data and

__label__1 This game is the prime example of an absolutely GREAT game...not only is it a visually beautiful game...it has gore which is icing On the cake.Not to mention the CHEAP PRICE!
__label__0 I paid 3 bucks to see a screen that says my device is not supported.Amazon doesn't do refunds so I am just plain out of luck.I have been a hoid cusyomer here, I have spent well over 1000$ on apps in the last tear or so, but, after this that will all chan
__label__1 Game is awesome on my bionic, plays smooth with no hiccups. You can get this for free through the getjar market but 2.99 isn't bad.
__label__1 First of all this app worked on my Motorola Droid X. It is not exclusive to the "Tegra 2". Its a little choppy (a tiny bit) but plays well and never force closes. I read the bad reviews on amazon, and then I read the good reviews on the Android Market an
__label__1 I got this game knowing I was gonna like it guess what I was right .This game has lots of blood . It is so cool you need to get it now. NOW I SAY NOW.
__label__1 very nicely done. maybe Amazon should have a kids freebie of the day so they can get there games and a adult section for useful apps for the rest of us. this way they will stop complaining about nonsense permissions or the fact there is no grams.
__label__1 This is a very clean, well laid out app that does exactly what it says in the description. I picked it up when it was the free app of the day and even though I don&apos;t use it all that much it&apos;s very handy to have when I do want it. I probably wou
__label__1 Great little conversion tool, pretty small but I moved it to SD anyway. Very convenient to do a quick conversion without going online. Would be nice to have a tablet specific layout option, buttons look huge on Xoom - but works fine and looks OK on a pho
__label__1 this is a great conversion app for Android, makes me wish Google would just buy them out and integrate it into the OS
__label__1 Wow, I cannot believe how thorough and powerful this app is. And if there's a unit you don't have, check the settings. It's there.
__label__1 I do a lot of conversions between US and European measurements, including (and most especially) currency.  The fact that it updates regularly, and I can set favorites for conversions I use often like temperature and distance is immensely convenient.  One
__label__1 I downloaded this for one conversion but find myself using it almost weekly. It has become a nice tool to have.
__label__1 this app is a great tool that does exactly what it says it does. it's simple to use, and easier than searching online.
__label__1 this app has come in handy more than once. great tool to have on your phone. i use it to convert data size a lot but it has a lot of different units it can convert
__label__1 Sorry to all the 1 stars that this is not a game. Do not give things a bad review because its not for you. If that's the case wait for tomorrow...it will be a game again. It's nice to see something useful! Simple to change converter type and works great.
__label__1 I use this app on a daily basis. It's easy to use on my phone's smaller screen but also works great on my tablet.
__label__1 I've had many of this sort of app on a variety of PDAs and smartphones going back to the Palm III in the mid-1990s.  This is probably the nicest conversion app I've used to date.  Not much to say other than how nicely it groups the various units of measu
__label__1 Very simple and easy to use! You can set up your favourites that use a lot or are more common in your area/country. Waiting for the update to keep favourite tab open first instead the &quot;all-tab&quot; You'll definitely use this app! Very convenient!
__label__1 Near perfect and yet 5 stars, thats because nothing's perfect.This app is everything I've ever wanted in a converter app. High precision, lots of units across all categories imaginable and beyond. Well organized UI with nice colour scheme. I love this ge
__label__1 As good as any of the other apps out there for conversions and there are many categories/units in the settings that can be turned on/off if you do not see your unit of measurement listed on the main menu (e.g. MBTU for measuring energy is off by default)
__label__1 For some reason when installing the application on my phone after setting it back to stock pounds was gone. It took me a while to find where I could re-enable it.
__label__1 Works great and looks great on my Droid X. Most useful to me is currency exchange rate function. However, swapping between From and To is a bit tricky. I had given up until someone else's comment explained how it works. The rule being, always press the "
__label__1 like the simplicity and it does what it says it does. it is a shame people are quick.to raye something one star when they failed to use and understand the app properly.
__label__0 There is absolutely no reason a simple converter app needs permission to read. my phone number, yet this one does.
__label__1 This is a very nice app with lots of conversion options.  Easy to use, clean interface. Wish it had Chilean pesos in currency conversion.
__label__0 Why in the name of all that's chocolate does a conversion calculator need full internet access?Do you people just blindly install and rate apps? Do you not care about your data or your privacy?Seriously, dev, why full internet access?
__label__1 this is just to offset the idiot complaining that the volume section doesn't have grams, how would you convert that parent of a special needs child?
__label__1 This is one of the best apps I have downloaded.  It's easy to use and will convert almost anything.  Used it daily while traveling in Europe so I would know exactly what I was spending in US dollars.  Would definitely recommend!
__label__1 Love the free app from Amazon today. &quot;converter&quot;. I just uninstalled 2 apps in exchange. Like the description says...&quot; If it can be converted it will do it&quot;. And it's really easy to use.
__label__1 This is one of the best conversion apps on the market. It provides a very simplistic interface for converting a variety of measurements. Download this for cooking, housework, schoolwork, or any other reason you can think of!
__label__1 This is a very clean, smooth, intuitive app. It can convert pretty much anything into anything else :-) I enjoy using it.Also, they have a very nice customer service. I had an occasion to email them a question and got back a responsed that answered my qu
__label__1 The app converts units as it describes it to do. Phone state permission is for when someone calls you as you convert something.Nicely done!
__label__1 I don't understand these fools rating this program 1-2 STARS....it does what it's suppose to. Friendly, easy, and efficient! I love it!
__label__1 I purchased this app because it was the "Free App of the Day" on Amazon Appstore.  I've used many Android-based converters in the past and while some of them were good, they seemed unpolished and very unorganized.The way this one is laid out is very aest
__label__1 I love a nice, simple app like this.  I'm surprised that people can't take a simple process and program something that is this easy to use.  Also, it does EVERYTHING, including currency which is something I did not expect.  If I had any complaint is that
__label__1 very useful app,  very clean neat and fast, best of all it keeps currency updated,  awesome simply awesome app , great app of the day
__label__1 It's a fairly straight forward converter application, but it looks without flaws and looks pretty good.  One of the cleanest converter apps!
__label__1 I use this converter for everything, from cooking to measurements.  It's straightforward, easy to use, and includes so many different conversion options.
__label__1 for those time when i need a conversion from one unit to another this has help me a lot.  Especially in a chemistry class were we were given problems which used the metric system and the professor wanted the answer in the English system.
__label__1 I've got to admit I'm a dunce when it comes to converting kb to MB to GB etc and what a nice surprise to find this app includes that. highly recommended.
__label__1 I just downloaded a similar app from another well known app place, but this one does what I want and more.
__label__1 I can find so many uses for this app. It has a smooth and fast interface. Way better than even the stock calculator has. One of the best productive apps out there.
__label__1 A great and very useful app for sure!  I've had numerous conversion apps and this rates among the best in my book. I've always preferred conv apps that function like basic calculators and that's exactly how this app looks, feels and functions.  Thanks Am
__label__1 I don't use it regularly, but when I do, I really want it. So it is always on one of the home screens on my phone!
__label__1 I used this tool at least once per week for various projects. Length and mass are my go-to conversions, but I've also used it for volumes and temperatures. It really does everything one could want. The interface is intuitive and clear. I can't think of a
__label__1 This app is easy to use and performs well. For most people it's one of those apps you won't use often but you'll be happy you have it when it's needed.
__label__1 This is a good app. It is simple, easy to use, and clutter free. Easily switch the &quot;to&quot; and &quot;from&quot; by simply pressing the one you want to be &quot;from&quot;. Has just about every unit you would want to convert. Did work ok without a 
__label__1 This is a great looking and easy to use little app that has lots of unit conversion categories. Along with the usual length, mass, energy, angles, etc. you have categories such as typeface sizes: points, picas, mils, inches, 72dpi, etc for just that one 
__label__1 Do you need to convert units of acceleration from &#34;feet / second squared&#34; to &#34;furlongs / fortnight squared&#34;? This application would do the job without much trouble. All common units and unit-groupings have direct conversions. And weird st
__label__0 Not going to install. No reason for this app to access my personal information like my phone state and identity. Invasive and sketchy that it takes that info for such a basic app.
__label__1 who needs a slide ruler when u got this.  works on nook color running cm7.  thanks amazon. keep em coming.
__label__1 App has a nice interface and it does exactly what it's supposed to. Can't really find anything to complain about. Thanks Amazon!
__label__1 I thought this would be a neat little tool to have ready access to.  As an computer engineer, I have to convert units from systems occasionally, and having a built-in calculator which does all manner of unit conversions is a handy thing to have around, w
__label__1 easy to use, easy to read! I installed this app just to see one currency conversion but kept it because I find I am the &quot;go to guy&quot; every time a friend has a currency question
__label__1 Great looking app that delivers.  There isn't too much more to say.  This app delivers on all levels.  It converts one unit of measurement to another, and has a very pleasant user interface.  There is no reason to not get this app.
__label__1 Really a four star app imho, but once again a bunch of morons gave it one star even though it absolutely doesn't deserve it.  I'm SO tired of people being incapable of reviewing directly, it honestly drives me insane.  Why are so many people on amazon so
__label__1 This is a highly polished app that can quickly and easily convert a very wide range of units.  Up until recently I'd only used this for price comparison at the grocery store based on sizes or whatnot.  However, I just started a Chemistry course and while
__label__1 It is great finding apps that actually make your life easier and more productive. As an engineer I use this app all the time.
__label__1 This is a great app, and a very useful one. Congrats to the Author!Now to all the stupid reviews:1. Why downgrade an app like this for finding a flaw? ALL, and I do mean ALL apps have mistakes in coding, or overlooked features, etc.Almost all authors are
__label__1 Especially helpful for us Europeans living in America ;) And for the person that was wondering about differences between positive and negative - ever thought about temperatures?
__label__0 Looks great but has every unit of volume except grams. Child is on special diet that requires me to measure and convert daily.
__label__1 Another &quot;why isn't this already built in to the standard program&quot; app. It does its job well &amp; is attractive. Would be nice to have button to reverse the conversion, rather than repicking both sides.  Nice job. May not use it much, but this 
__label__1 I like all the options it provides. I have thought of many idea for this app already in my mobile food truck : The Twisted Sister House of Hunger.
__label__1 This app does everything it promises in the app name: It's small, lightweight, converts quantities,....ummm and now all I'm doing is stretching to meet the 20 word minimum Amazon requires for reviews.
__label__1 Really love it, can't stop. Kindle fire is s great device, web, reading, games, but sometimes I find this game gets more attention then my reading......LOVE IT
__label__1 This is a great game, but has a flaw. When you tap on the cell to win, you sometimes have to tap it a dozen or so times before it lets you tap on the item to win. More likely than not, you will lose that win.
__label__1 love this game. hope you upgrade it. thanks. I am glad that this game is so user-friendly and I like playing this version of bingo.
__label__1 Best bingo game I'm playing on my Kindle.  No issues, great game play.  Love that you can easily earn $, tickets and power ups as you are playing thus enabling you to play for a longer period of time especially compared to some bingo games out there.
__label__0 another disappointing game, I do not play this one I' am so sorry I got this game, I took it off m y list
__label__1 I enjoy this game a lot!  You connect a series of dots until all dots are connected.  The only negative thing I could say about this game is the voice that yells at you when you make a wrong move.
__label__1 this app is wicked. it is sooo fun and addicting. u should really get this app. it works really good on the kindle fire just to let other kindle fire owners if they are interested. but seriously......u should get this app.
__label__1 Legitimately my favourite app ever (aside from television apps ;P) and the ads aren't bothersome either, so it's a win-win!
__label__1 It makes my thirteen year old's &#34;brain work.&#34; She and i both enjoy it. Trace the lines throughout a drawing without crossing over a line multiple times. Becomes increasingly more complex. Graphics are aglow and kiddos like that as well.
__label__1 I luv this game so freaking much!!!!!its the most addicting game Ive evr played! I promise u jtht u will &lt;3 this game!
__label__1 the app was awesome! but got a little boring after 150 levels gone by!! still really great app and totally should by this!
__label__1 I LOVE this app! Very fun. Can easily be a time killer. I highly recommend this app if you like puzzles, and fun!
__label__1 this is so fun you use your brain I like it excpet for the ow when you make a mistake
__label__1 I love this game it couldn't be better I'm addicted. Very happy about this app. I played for hours straight. I got to level 178 in one day. SO ADDICTIVE!
__label__1 I loooooove this game its very fun and addicting its a must have game fun for all ages its awesomeley awesome
__label__1 I use this on my kindle fire and I have tried many,many, apes, but this one is the most addictive one and very challenging,  that I have played so far. Ionce u get going you can boy quit.!!  seriously!  you gotta try it out.
__label__1 GlowPuzzle is a Must Have for the puzzle lover. Very colorful and easy on the eyes. Difficult enough to challenge me, easy enough to keep me from getting frustrated. Apparently, an unlimited number of levels. My thanks and appreciation to the developer.
__label__1 I love this game so much! it is just so much tuna nd it is really addicting. I love puzzle games and games that relate to that so I downloaded this app because there were so many positive comments and me and my friends find it fun and addicting. so if yo
__label__1 Love how difficult and easy this app is. Fun to compete with the friends, family and the boyfriend. It's simple and fun.
__label__1 This app rocks. I &lt;3 this app. I love it and i think u will 2. I am bored out of my mind. HELP ME. :-|...
__label__1 Very fun little puzzle game with a twist. Some puzzles are easy, some are more challenging, but it's a fun game to kill some time and doesn't require any reading skills, so it's great for kids, too. For free, I'd highly recommend it.
__label__1 A lot more fun than I figured it would be. Addictive even. The idea is simple, following patterns by touching the screen, making designs in neon that remind me a lot of a light bright. You can fly through levels but there are lots here, plus different mo
__label__1 The is a a really great tool kit (utility) for the Droid. I especially like the utility that advises which apps can be moved to my SD Card and also the battery widget.
__label__1 this is great! It is like a one-stop-shop! Task killer, battery widget, CPU and an uninstaller all in one. It reminds u to put your new app to your SD card. nifty.
__label__0 Don't waste your space or time on this one. And the retail price is $4... forget it! Still waiting for thumb keyboard to come up on FAOTD.
__label__0 After I started using it my phone started rebooting randomly.  And when I uninstalled every thing went back to normal.
__label__0 don't bother with a space wasting battery eating program that is inferior to others and looks like an older ad-free version. your os already does it is better. where do these crazy promos come from?
__label__0 There is no reason for this app. All of this is or can be done much better. Dev just taking advantage.
__label__1 this app works great for me. thanks Amazon for offering it for free. i actually prefer this app to the last utility app that i had. user friendly interface and easy to figure out for the most part.
__label__1 Yes Android phones can do what this app offers. The app isn't magic, it just makes things a couple clicks easier to find. Instead of hunting through settings. It all right there one click. Pretty much for people that are not tech savvy and things easy.
__label__1 This app is worth a ton of money! It does all the things I need in a toolbox app. The developer is constantly improving the app, and is very responsive to input. I am really impressed with this, and I get the pro version for free today!
__label__1 This is actually an excellent and feature rich application. The difference between pro and free version are the ads and it seems most people don't get that.Anyway, it really is a swiss army knife of apps that keep you from having to install a ton of sepa
__label__1 After working with this for a month, and using a host of other things, I agree with another reviewer, this is better than Advanced Task Killer.  The main reason I like it is because it has everything I need to remember to watch all in one place.  Cache f
__label__0 Just wanted to put in my two cents. there is really nothing new about this app. Check the rights and restrictions.
__label__1 I tried both the Pro and the Free. The Free has  ads, the Pro does not. Version differences are by design. Test for yourself.
__label__1 this is an awesome app every android user should use this for their smart phone which is great. you should get this app today
__label__0 1. NEWER version in the market for free2. No dev website that I could find3. Review written by dev pretending to be a user.Shady shady dev.  I wish I hadn't downloaded.  Will Never install.  Wish I could rate this zero stars.
__label__1 A few weeks ago Amazon's free app was Taskkiller Pro.  I downloaded it, but killing tasks is not something that is so big in the latest versions of Android.  But the one thing I did love about it was that I could use it to find apps that could be moved t
__label__0 I have no respect for any dev that would go and give themselves 5star reviews. seriously they are so blatantly obvious!
__label__0 The Android OS already does these things, i dont see the purpose of installing an app that wastes more memory, ram, battery and cpu
__label__1 I liked the free version anyway, so this is a win.The &quot;older version than Android market&quot; problem is really Amazon's problem. They responded to my question with something about carefully testing apps. Certainly possible, but weak excuse. Makes 
__label__0 Downloaded, installed, and my tablet went FUBAR with 10+ apps force closing after reboot.  Uninstalled, fixed permissions, and it's back to normal.  Can't say what it was specifically but this app did not play well with my apps (even the Amazon AppStore)
__label__0 100% unnecessary. Android already does all of this (except, apparently batch, but who really needs to do that?) Just a waste of time, and just another scam trying to make a buck off of doing nothing. Do yourself a favor and stay away from this app.
__label__0 Like a previous reviewer pointed out, the same application seems to exist on the regular Android market but it's free to begin with and the version number is higher. Unless this &quot;pro&quot; version offers more functionality than the free version on t
__label__1 does everything it promises. really uniform ui, easy to use. overall good phone management app. already recommending app, looking forward to demoing the app on my review show
__label__0 Android OS already does this. Also, dev appears to be scamming people. Free version in google market that does the same thing.
__label__1 I've uninstalled 3 other utility programs since intslling this all in one tool.  Handles app2sd flawless)y.  Does tons more!  My favorite app!
__label__0 For peddling this old version that's free in the Android Market, and pretending that it's 3.99.Pathetic. Sad. Silly. Shady.
__label__0 These kind of apps are a waste of time and energy. The Android Os was designed to do these things by itself. It doesn't need your help!LEAVE ANDROID ALONE!!!!!
__label__1 A great program to do most of the&quot;necessary&quot;things that keep phone in working order, and all in one nice little place
__label__1 One person says something and the rest of you follow. There is no proof that the developer wrote the beginning reviews, let alone any of the reviews. And I'm sure he/she knew that Android was capable of doing everything this app does on it's own but peop
__label__0 I usually don't freak out about security, but these guys crossed the line.  One day after their aotd release, they sent out an update.  The aotd versions had suitable permissions for a system management app.  The update?  Not at all.If someone can explai
__label__0 Due to the weight of the reviews I am passing on the Free App of the Day for the first time since Amazon opened their app store.People's opinions do matter.
__label__0 why a) get something android already does for free B) is available for free on the market but w/o the pro tag. i think not.
__label__0 it seems the only 5 star reviews for this product is from the developer.  you do not need this app.  froyo already does all of this better than this app.  DO NOT DOWNLOAD
__label__1 this is an excellent app a bug existed and was foind and fixed within 24 hrs now that is service!
__label__0 I wouldn't recommend this app... even when they're giving it away.This app tries to do many things... and does none of them well.Try &quot;Elixir&quot; if your looking for a good free monitor app. &quot;AutoAppOrganizer&quot; and/or &quot;App 2 SD Free&q
__label__1 Wow! It's hard to see why people are so negative about this app. While I would never pay 4 bucks for it, as a free app it works just fine. Does Android already do all of this stuff? Yes, but this brings all of the functions into one place with a better i
__label__0 I used to use this app quite a lot. I actually used the free version from Google Play before it was available here. Too bad it seems the play version is way more updated than here, probably because they charge more for the &quot;pro&quot; version there. 
__label__1 Thanks for this app, many features make it a one stop tool for moving apps to the sd, installing/uninstalling apps, a task killer, battery checker, and more.Thanks again!
__label__1 I use this app to quickly move apps around from onboard storage to my microSD card and I use the included task killer widget to free up space and preserve battery life. This app also provides access to the hidden folders in your phone not normally availa
__label__1 Downloaded yesterday, so far does all I need it to. Replaced a few programs I had installed. Fast customer service for an issue I had with a pop up.
__label__0 Developing an app that is basically a virus and running it as the App of the Day is annoying. The multiple positive reviews that are clearly all from the same person is offensive. Sorry, developer. Make a substandard product, engage in obviously seedy pr
__label__0 This app would actually take up more memory and battery life! Android OS does all of the functions described here and a&quot;task killer&quot; actually would do more harm than good! Devs, stop making these things! And shame on Amazon for even offering th
__label__1 There are so many junk apps out there, this one gives a lot of great info without messing up my phone. I almost didn't get it, glad I did. Try it out and uninstall if you don't like it. HTC EVO 4G
__label__1 I absolutely love this app. It takes the place of so many. No need for a separate App2SD, it creates a list of all apps that can be moved, as well as notifies you, and you just move them from there. The uninstaller is great. You can batch uninstall which
__label__1 No I am not the developer, I'm just a fair user.Come on guys, this program does exactly what the developer claims. A few of the features are handy. It's not spectacular, but it worth keeping an eye on.You should thank Amazon and the author for giving us 
__label__1 I love this app! it has everything,  even an app killer and an uninstaller! Its the easiest way to access ALL your phone's settings!
__label__1 It works well.. You should therefore try it out.. Please make sure you stick to the plan and execute the best practices.
__label__1 The Good:From one app you can clear you app's cache, free memory, etc.The Bad:The folder system is annoying to use.
__label__0 I wish there was a way to give less then 1 stars. This has been a very good app for me. Worked as promised. I've been having battery issues and did a factory reset on my phone. Decided not to install Amazon app store and now SuperBox Pro does not functio
__label__0 This app is complete garbage and you can try all day long to post your own 5 star reviews, but everyone sees through that. Its a nice try, but if you are going to develop, #1 Create something that isn't included and #2 Let it stand on it's own, don't cre
__label__1 I've had this app for several months now. I use it daily. Sure, you can do most of what this offers already, but if I can put it all in 1 place in 1 app I'm all for that.My only complaint is Amazon allowing people who don't have the app to review it. If 
__label__1 It's just like age of war witch is awesome and amazing. It's a fun game. So I give it a thumbs up.
__label__1 I have two boys that are 4 and 3 and are very into dinosaurs and this interactive read to me book did the trick. They enjoyed it quite a bit. As other reviewers have stated, the facts may be a bit off as the T-rex was not the largest dinosaur but it is t
__label__1 Bought for my nephew he really enjoys the book. He thinks it's a big deal he cando it all by himself.
__label__0 t rex. was a little scavenger with tiny arms. if you want to see a real predator check out the spinosaurus, a 60 foot monster!!!!!
__label__0 my grandson was uninterested and he loves dinosaurs.  so short and a waste of money.  i would not recommend this to anyone.
__label__1 This app is designed for people who love audiobooks and convert their books from cd or get their books from places other than audible like the library or itunes. I have not tested audible files but it says it supports tons of formats and i have tested mo
__label__1 Works well for audiobooks, especially if you're switching between different books as I am.  It keeps your place and volume settings.  It only took me about half an hour to decide it was worth upgrading to the full version!
__label__1 I am a fan of librovox audio books, and this works great for listening to these recordings.  So simple and user friendly.  I appreciate the functions and simplicity.
__label__0 Would not play my audiobooks downloaded from another App. I had to find another App to listen to the audiobooks.This was a disappointment due to this Apps advertisement.
__label__1 Great game with multiple solutions for each puzzle. Their website says that they are now working on an expansion pack with new elements.
__label__1 I am completely hooked on this game. I downloaded it and went to go eat breakfast,  half an hour later I was still playing this game and hadn&apos;t eaten. The only thing that bothers me though is I don&apos;t think there should be an option to use pigme
__label__1 There are many ways to solve any given level, which I really appreciate. And the ability to see how others solved it puts this game firmly in 5-star territory.
__label__1 Brilliantly done. I&apos;m glad to finally see a challenging game offered as the free app for a change. (If you missed it for free, it&apos;s well worth your dollar.) The only problem I&apos;ve had so far has been that prisms sometimes get messed up when
__label__1 This game keeps me challenged, sometimes for days. Totally worth a dollar. No fc issues on my droid charge. Don't let a couple complaints about controls deter you, it takes some getting used to although if you long press a mirror or prism it will delete 
__label__1 I purchased this app from the Android app store and I can guarantee you that it is well worth the 99 cents, let alone getting it for free. Some people won't get the concept of the game because they are well, idiots! But if you are of a higher order, grab
__label__1 Very highly addictive. May be banded as a substance control drug. And may be a felony for even have this game on your person. Has been known for tearing families apart, in the future it may rise to $0. 99 a megabyte so get it now at this low price.... Oh
__label__1 This is a great game.  Works great on my tablet.  It's a game you can sit down and actually look for a solution rather than throwing a bird again and hoping it hits in the right spot. This is definitely a game you need to show your Apple friends since th
__label__1 I'm pretty terrible at puzzle games, and these are definitely challenging.  That said, it's a simple enough mechanic that you can wrap your head around what you're trying to do, even if the solution isn't obvious.  I am partially color-blind, so occasion
__label__1 This game is deceptively simple and often maddeningly deceitful. A puzzle fan&apos;s delight but it&apos;ll test your iq. an effortless recommendation @ $1 droid x cm7
__label__1 The game is very well designed, and the levels are very clever. The new update seems to have added the ability to look at other people's solutions. Unfortunately, the solutions don't always save right, so there is some fiddling you have to do to get the 
__label__1 i picked it for free and couldnt stop  playing it. i now only have one lvl left if youve figured ou lvl 6.6 please tell me  because im at a loss
__label__1 this is currently my favorite goto game when I'm stuck somewhere waiting. challenging without being frustrating. is nice to look at too. after the first few levels I thought I would get board, but once you get past section two it gets more interesting.
__label__0 I really enjoy puzzle games and I thought the concept was interesting but this game just simply runs awful, even on high end phones. Additionally, it&apos;s just not at all fun to play. Very boring gameplay, controls, and interface. There were several co
__label__1 The game is difficult at times. Hands down the best puzzle game out. I love the challenge it brings. Runs great on the HTC Incredible
__label__1 recommend this to anyone who likes a challenge. a really unique puzzle game that requires a bit of patients to figure out.
__label__1 This is a very clever and challenging puzzle game. I can not stop playing it. Perfect as a quick, on the go time waster.
__label__1 This is a beautifully logical puzzle game, with nice super-visible (and perfectly simple) graphics. Learn to mix colors and manipulate angles using mirrors and prisms. The game starts off easy to allow you to learn its controls, but then gradually become
__label__0 rebooting issue started with the installation of this app and ceased right after I uninstalled it. besides that it was an OK game. my reviews are usually only positive ones, but the rebooting issue killed me. [sensation 4g]
__label__1 Great job developers.  I&apos;m a big fan of puzzle games and this one is a lot of fun.  I don&apos;t know what the one reviewer considers &quot;a high end phone&quot; but this thing runs without a hiccup on my rooted droidx and galaxy tab.  Thanks again
__label__1 I really liked the concept of using mirrors and prisms to reflect, split or combine colored lasers and match the color of the goal. The interface is nice and simple and game is easy to play. The difficulty is finding the right combination of prisms and m
__label__1 This is by far the best phone game I have ever played.  I am impressed with its intellectual concept and challenging levels.  I have spent many a sleepless night speeding through the clock playing.  Thank you!
__label__1 Super fun and addicting game. Wish it was available on iOS since I don't have my Kindle anymore. If you like puzzle games this is a good one. The levels start out pretty easy, then some get pretty tricky.
__label__1 Fantastic game! Challenging and different game play. I am really enjoying it. Not too hard but not too easy is making for a fun experience.
__label__1 Not a game that can be played with extraneous noise going on, needs a high level of concentration. I can see this appealing to nascent scientists.
__label__1 I really like this game. It&apos;s more fun than a bindle of carrots! I guess it could be classified as a physics of light game, but that&apos;s a little too wordy. it&apos;s fun, not that difficult, and definitely worth a dollar.
__label__1 If you do its your own fault for being stupid. Wait till its free, this happens almost every day, you think people would get it by now.
__label__1 This game runs well on android. It is very challenging but not so challenging that you get frustrated and stop playing. Every level presents unique challenges to overcome. I really love this game and will be disappointed when I finish it. Great concept g
__label__1 I always wanted to get myself that Khet laser game, but didn't want to spend $30. Refraction is a fun and entertaining take on using mirrors and prisms to redirect light beams to hit targets. This is the first game that I have paid for. I don't have a lo
__label__1 This game is a fantastic and addictive time killer, but it is very hard to select colors in the prism, which I find very annoying. Sometimes, the prism will disappear. All in all, a very good game in which I am enjoying very much!
__label__1 This game is a lot of fun and it is absolutely worth a buck. It is a unique puzzle game that will keep you entertained. Highly recommended.
__label__1 I don't play a lot of computer games. I almost never play games on cell phones. But when I saw this as the Free App of the Day, I snapped it right up. I had played a more sophisticated PC version of this game a few years back, and was hooked.This is a lo
__label__1 The graphics are very basic but the game is easy to learn once you start playing around with it. I like that it is a very smart game and that there are multiple solutions. If you are up for a brain challenge then I would say that this game is definitely 
__label__1 This is a great game! I&apos;ve played similar flash games before, but this version improves on them. I&apos;m glad it is the free app of the day, but after playing it, I would gladly pay for it...
__label__1 Could&apos;ve sworn I played this game before; but must have been thinking of something similar. None the less, this is a great game. Ramps up nicely and doesn&apos;t simply throw you to the wolves; nor does it treat you with kid gloves. Also a good way 
__label__1 a excellent time waster,  great puzzles and its absolutely perfect for the train ride into the city.  an A+ application on the original droid.
__label__1 The game is pretty fun and so far from what I can tell it is kinda like the puzzles used to open crates in Gameloft&apos;s Nova. Now I have a rooted htc EVO with cm7.0.3.1(if you don&apos;t know what that is well maybe google it and find out it&apos;s wa
__label__1 This is a nice mellow puzzle game for when you don&apos;t have a lot of time.  Puzzles are well thought out and challenging not frustrating.
__label__1 wasn&apos;t sure the first few levels but now it&apos;s gotten personal. I have been. cracked out on this for hours
__label__1 Takes a couple levels to get the hang of the controls but easy afterwards. For those that said it&apos;s too hard too quickly, well the world needs ditch diggers too. Seriously, it might just not be your type of game. Don&apos;t ask them to dumb it down 
__label__1 Refraction is a great, addictive logic puzzle game.  It starts off pretty easy, but quickly moves on to much more complicaed levels.  Very fun game--definitely worth the $0.99 price.
__label__1 Got this as free app of the day but I&apos;d happily pay for this ($0.99 is a steal)!  Game looks easier than it is, but that&apos;s not a bad thing!  It&apos;s just challenging enough! Definitely try it out!
__label__1 This &quot;game&quot; has given me many hours of fun!  I say game, but it&apos;s much more than that, it&apos;s also a good mental workout.  I&apos;m a programmer and games like these keep my brain sharp.  For me the first 3 levels were a really easy, bu
__label__1 This IS my Go-To game of preference - I prefer it to anything similar or dis-similar out there!  I love it and wish they would add more levels!
__label__1 I got the free version from the other app market, which might be why my scores appear to not have transferred to this paid version. Pretty much my only real complaint about this app, and not a big one since I&apos;ll just replay those levels again.\n\nSi
__label__1 I started playing this game and then told my husband about it so he could join in on the madness. Now I have to try to drag him away. It's addictive and employs sometimes thinking about things in ways you weren't expecting.
__label__1 This is one of the best executions of this style game I have ever seen. The puzzles are unique and require thought but are not so difficult they can&apos;t be solved (yet). Love this app!
__label__1 I picked this app up when it was the free app of the day, but it is definitely worth more then the $.99 this dev is charging. It&apos;s fun, challenging, and well made.
__label__1 It's a fun puzzle game that's challenging without being too frustrating. The components are simple - colored beams of light, mirrors, and prisms which split the light beams in two. You have to guide the beams of light to the same-colored targets. It star
__label__1 This is a fun and clever game but it takes a while to get interesting.  After about 30 levels I was ready to call it quits because the levels didn't feel challenging, just tedious.  But shortly after this the difficulty ramps up-- the boards are more con
__label__1 The concept is simple, the channenge is simple enough to split light beams and then recombine them.  I have enjoyed this app so much as a way to pass time and for 99 cents I highly recommend it to everyone.
__label__1 The app does not become free until 3:15 AM EST.  That&apos;s 12:15 AM PST for those of us who can&apos;t understand what a time zone is. \n\nThe app itself. It&apos;s hilariously fun. Definitely worth getting. Goofy and fun to play.
__label__1 Like portal, this game offers exactly what you expect, a bunch of fun puzzles that make you think, but are solvable. You get more than enough pieces to accomplish a puzzle so there are countless ways to beat each level. Yet the limited amount of space fo
__label__1 A great little puzzle game that plays on colors and their interactions.  This might have a chance of being difficult if you&apos;re colorblind, but even then still worth a try.
__label__1 This game is really interesting and entertaining. It requires you to think and it&apos;s frustrating yet rewarding. Controls are pretty obvious and practical.
__label__1 This is an awesome game that gets progressively harder as you advance.  I got this as a Free App of the Day, but would have definitely bought it if necessary.  Thanks!
__label__1 simple concept but the puzzles are very fun. some of them are quite easy others took me a long time to figure out. great game to pull out when I only have a few minutes. I hope to see a sequel.
__label__1 this is the most fun of any the brain teasers I have tried on google android.  if you like brain teasers and don&apos;t like this it&apos;s not the program it&apos;s you.  It it is very challenging . You can use it in shorts stents, but I found it very h
__label__1 Great Time stealer ! Will not Disappoint  Still have not gotten passed the first level.  Has me thinking in my sleep how to solve!
__label__1 Love this game for its puzzle solving and critical thinking. Keeps me entertained, and is a great learning game for my son. Works perfectly on my Epic 4G.
__label__1 This is a fun puzzle game in which you use mirrors and prisms to align and change colors to solve the puzzles. The difficulty of the levels range from easy to pretty difficult. This game is fun and works perfect on the kindle fire. Great value at .99 cen
__label__1 I've actually had this game for quite a while when the dev posted it in r/Android on Reddit a while back. I liked how during testing he got the input of the Android community there and made a lot of tweaks according to what users posted. Not a lot of Red
__label__1 I paid for this game a few weeks ago. Once I got the hang of it, you couldn&apos;t drag me away. Maybe now that it&apos;s free app of the day, people might start sharing screenshots online. Because some levels are tough.
__label__1 Very original puzzle game, but I wish there was an option to turn off haptic feedback.  I also wish there wasn&apos;t a 20 word minimum...
__label__1 The app works great.  No problems so far.  As for the game, I like it.  Good puzzle game.  I will recommend this to all my friends
__label__1 I got this as a FAotD and have made it roughly through the first &apos;sector&apos;.\nIts very configurable.  So far, puzzles have been interesting, without being too complex.  Your solutions seem to be stored so you can try to improve the economy of the
__label__1 I thoroughly enjoy this game. Haven&apos;t put it down since I downloaded it. Oonce you get the hang of it, the only frustration is solving the puzzle itself. Took some ui setting changes to get the prisms usable...
__label__1 one of the better free apps of the day. i actually played the demo app a couple of days ago, and now its free. glad amazon is starting to make better apps avaliable for the free one of the day. even if it was not free today i would have bought, get it wh
__label__1 It's worth every single cent. Definitely a great time waster on your phone. Don't mistake this for anything other than a puzzle game, but I absolutely adore that each puzzle has multiple possible solutions, allowing you to piddle around, and work it out 
__label__1 people need to learn two things before they download the daily free app...\n1. how to read\n2. patience\nso much fail in here
__label__1 This is what a game should be...easy to learn but always a challenge as each new level gets progressively harder.  Fantastic!!!!
__label__1 This is a very enjoyable bunch of logic puzzles.  They start easy enough but before long they really make your brain work to figure them out.
__label__1 great, fun and challenging game!! People, don&apos;t leave low reviews because you don&apos;t know how to read directions. I have a MyTouch4G (with a 3.5&quot; screen) and I can read them just fine. Keep it up devs!!!
__label__1 I got this the other day when it was free but i would have gladly paid for it. Great game all around, and very unique. Like someone else said, its a nice break from angry birds. This is my new favorite. Looks and runs great on my droid 1, cant wait to pl
__label__1 This wallpaper is so pretty! My fav color is green too, so it makes it better! Works perfect and the quality is beautiful on LG Optimus V.
__label__1 It's 3D! As you move to different screens on your android device you get to see different angles of the fountain.
__label__1 This Wallpaper is really beautiful. It does do some damage to your battery life, but not as much as others I have used. The scene turns as you move through your home screens. As a proud Celtic, I have to say I love it!
__label__1 I really liked the way this looks on my DROID2. smooth graphics with no lagging. I was willing to by the upgrade just to support them
__label__1 I got this app and instantly loved it ,I'm irish so that's why!!! its great because it has beautiful green clovers ,it shines light onto the pretty fountain, it has beautiful background!!!!!!!!! (There is no sound )it is great for Irish lovers!!! i totta
__label__1 Is very pretty. No problems using the wallpaper. I Recommend this wallpaper. er er er er er er er e
__label__0 Does not work for Droid Incredible v.1. Glad I did not spend money in this. Will try to reinstall when I upgrade my phone in March.
__label__0 I'm searching and searching and searching for an app that will join the ringer, system and notifications volumes, but none seem to work for the S3.  this is about the 10th one I've tried today.
__label__0 OK, but cumbersome and time consuming to work with. I like only one or two clicks to make things work the way I want on my equipment.
__label__1 I don't know everything this program does because I'm lazy that way. What it does for me is let me reset the volume on my phone with one touch. I have a Samsung Galaxy Nexus and it is far too easy to change the volume on different things without even not
__label__1 Fixed my problem on my Kindle Fire. On the top of the right corner of it, it had an Icon with a mute on it. It fixed.it and now I have an alarm. Really good app.
__label__1 My devise needed that extra boost, and this APP was just right!  It help give it a louder and more clear tone....
__label__1 This is the best app for controlling the sound for every thing on the kindle every one that has one should get this app you will love it as much as I do
__label__1 I was having trouble with my kindle and it wouldn't have a sound when a app was done downloading and it had a mute sign at the top right but the sound was turned all the way up .when I downloaded this app I found almost every thing about the volume has i
__label__0 I've deleted this app after 6 months because it wasn't helpful for me.I had hoped it would allow me to boost the volume on my Kindle Fire at those times that I need it.I heard no difference from before or after.
__label__1 This is definitely the answer if you're having volume issues with your android/tablet. The volume gets loud enough for headphones and even loud enough to hear across the room in my case. Not bad. A quick warning however is that music can get really loud 
__label__1 I only wish that I had internet on my phone to download it because the App on my Kindle Fire is so much easier to use then the tool on my phone.  You just cannot beat the price - free.
__label__1 Simple and easy to use. Perfect for my Kindle Fire, I use Google voice for texting on it and the notification sounds were never loud enough.
__label__0 wasteful app for a kindle.  Don't bother, don't waste your time downloading & installing.  Completely unnecessary.  If you are having trouble with your volume, this won't fix it, there are other solutions.
__label__1 This is a very nice free app but it doesn't do anything you couldn't do yourself.  It does, however, make changing the volume much easier since all the controls are in one spot so I give it five stars.
__label__1 Absolutely love qvc and this app puts one of my favorite shopping apps right at my fingertips everywhere I go very simple to use
__label__1 App downloaded quickly and was easy to use.  I was able to browse and shop as usual with no problems.

__label__1 Good app I use QVC quite a bit, it's easy to navigate. I love having it on the carousel and not needing to go thru the web.
__label__1 Good Kindle App.  The QVC site has some glitches, and makes to too easy to order using 1 click so watch out.
__label__1 Great short cut to get to QVC, love all the apps, easy to use and fast.  Thanks again for the great app
__label__1 I am glad to see this on my Kindle Fire. I don.t always need my computer to check out items being offered on QVC.
__label__1 I am happy to have the QVC app for my Kindle.  I plan to use it mainly to browse..any buying I do will be done by phone
__label__1 I check with QVC every morning and night before bed. This APP is so much easier than signing onto my computer.I keep updated on my order status, past  items on air (my favorite part) and TSV.
__label__1 I find the shopping on QVC to be quick and easy, and the products to be what they're touted to be. So anything that makes the site easier to use is ok by me.
__label__1 if you are a shopper here you will like this one.  It connects you to the same QVC you know and trust.  Has worked well for me when I used it.
__label__1 If you like shopping with QVC....you will be very glad to use this app.  After all....many people bought their Kindle Fire's HD from QVC, and Amazon would not let any company handle their sales if they did not think they were completely capable and effic
__label__1 I got this app for my grandmother who is in to the QVC stuff and she seems to approve of its ease of use and convenience.
__label__1 I have been a customer of qvc for over 20year's of course I love the channel do most of my shopping with them
__label__1 I have this app on my phone and added it to my Kindle.  It is an easy way to see what has recently aired or what is on clearance or easy pay.  It is also an easy, maybe too easy to purchase.  It is a simple 1 click and the item is purchase and on it's wa

__label__0 I opted out of this app as I no longer will shop with QVC.  I have shopped with them since they were CVN and have spent literally thousands of dollars with them.  I got stiffed on my last purchase.  I ordered a set of chair arm covers and a headrest cove
__label__1 I order regularly on this appl.  It is easy and accessible and glad it is on my Kindle Fire. YES!
__label__1 I WATCH ON TV, BUT SO MUST BETTER TO HAVE IT ON THE TABLET ON MY LAP FOR QUICK ACCESS

__label__1 Love,Love.  I can view what is going on the Q without disturbing my granddaughters programs .Also when traveling there is easy access
__label__1 Makes shopping easy and fun ! The TSV's are usually real bargains. The easy pay option is always a help. I like that you receive the item after the first payment.Be careful,QVC can be addictive..LOL
__label__1 My favorite shopping place!  LOVE it!  This makes my shopping experience so easy and I can buy stuff with a few clicks!
__label__1 Of course this is great, I have been a QVC shopper forever and I can Q anywhere there is Wi-Fi to look at all the latest sales and styles without buying a thing.  This way I never miss a Today's Special.  Thus I can show others the great things on the Q.
__label__1 QVC is my favorite home shopping channel, so of course I was thrilled I was able to download this app. Loads quickly and very easy to use.
__label__1 Recently cut out cable and miss qvc. Now I can watch live from my kindle. Great app. Highly recommended. No glitches so far
__label__1 This QVC app is just like being on TV.  You click on it, and there you are, ready to shop till you drop.  If you like watching QVC, this free app for the Android is perfect.  I have it for my Kindle and it works great.  Yes, I do recommend this.
__label__1 What is it that  qvc don&#34;t sell. i just sit & watchthem do there thing. every hour by the hour it&#34;s sonething different. this us a must have app.
__label__1 Works great for me. I can go directly to QVC without having to go through the web process.  Highly recommend.
__label__1 You can see what the TS is without having to turn on your computer.  It makes it so easy to shop
__label__0 I would like to know who ordered this product for me.  I don't use it and am afraid that it might have a virus.
__label__1 I am a great fan of QVC and ordering from this company. Their range of products is HUGE, their customer service dept. is the best, their shipping dept. gets orders to me FAST and in perfect condition, and their returns dept. so helpful and understanding.
__label__1 I like the convenience of home shopping. Doing it on my Kindle will be even better. I would recommend QVC to my friends
__label__1 Love the app to get to QVC, they are number one with me. You can review items they have available, but you have to have WiFi to be able to get this app. Can't say enough about being able to get to QVC on this app without having a computer available all t
__label__1 I have shopped QVC for years and years.  Now the site is available all the time and at my finger tips.  It is so easy if you have any questions or concerns.  Everything I have purchased has been great.
__label__0 I can not post to the community forum using the app. The browsing experience is nothing like the website experience.  I just uninstalled the app and prefer to use the silk browser on my kindle fire.
__label__1 The QC app is great for the Android.  I have shopped w/ QVC for 15 years.  Their service is impeccable.  The values--especially for jewelry are unmatched.  30-day returns are a wonderful option.
__label__1 I LOVE QVC. SIMPLE AS THAT. PRODUCTS ARE TOP RATED. RETURNS IF NEEDED&#62; BUT never needed to return anything ever. I love the operators when I call in. Ordering on line is easier than ever before.I could hooked on buying and buying, but I watch my spen
__label__1 Another great online shopping app from another renowed shopping channel. It also expands the choices for online shopping. QVC is nice although I find HSN better.
__label__1 I have been a fan of QVC since 1987.  Love having it on the go.  I have to always check out the Today's Special.
__label__1 Great app. I use this all of the time.  It does take some getting used to as it has a different layout from my home computer. Still it works really well.
__label__1 I think this application is great.  Whenever you aren't near your cell or just want to know what is being shown, etc., this app is there for you.  It is convenient and easy to navigate.
__label__1 I have been a fan of QVC for quite some time and i love that i can now get it on my Kindle. My first order off it was so easy and i just love having the ability to order and view other than my phone or computer.
__label__0 This app takes several seconds to load and sometimes will take minutes.  It often returns an error message that it needs to close either when I'm using the app or when I'm doing a product search.  I tried uninstalling it and also removing it from my list
__label__1 Being a big QVC fan, I do like this app !  I need to explore it more...with my credit card in hand.
__label__1 This app has made my life so much easier, when needing to search for products on the 7" tab. I used to have to type qvc.com in a web browser...but with this app, I type what we need and in a few seconds (usually) the product is there. Love It!!!!!
__label__1 I do not shop at stores and don't buy more than what I need.  No compulsion buying and I check reviews before buying
__label__1 HD quality video streaming is nice, plays fluidly and doesn't disconnect. Ability to check your order status, view the item on air, and recent items on air are nice touches. App looks nice, has good graphics, and transitions well when moving from one thi
__label__1 This app is great for accessing you qvc account.  It is very easy to use. You can save your info for fast shopping.
__label__1 I shop on QVC all the time.  its great,  no hassle driving  to the store to try on clothes.  you order & receive new merchandise to try for 30 days.  if you do not like it, just return for refund minus shipping.  if you need a different size, just return
__label__1 I check it from time to time to see what is featured. Love to see what is on even when I'm away from the tv
__label__1 I enjoy seeing the products that I am most interested in at my convince. And only those I want. I do most of my shopping with qvc.

__label__1 QVC has such wonderful products. Now I can access anywhere there is WiFi. I buy quite a bit from QVC. It has gotten much easier now. The free access is great. Wish we could access the &#34;In The Kitchen With David APP&#34;, however. It seems to only be 
__label__1 one of my favorite channelshave on another deviceso much easier to usenot always in the room with the pc
__label__1 This app makes finding an item on  QVC so much easier. Any one ever frustrated by the experience of  trying to get through their product finder line, will be glad to have it. I do find myself comparing prices between QVC and Amazon now too. LOL
__label__1 I have been a member and a shopper from qvc from  day one, before it was called qvc. I just love it. But shipping and handling is a little high. The hosts are wonderful.
__label__1 As a senior citizen with some disabilities, being able to shop on line or from the TV with great value, selection, and pricing not to mention having it delivered to my door is a combination that cannot be beat.  Customer service is excellent, return poli
__label__1 My wife loves it, Dave can see what specials are on and what was on that day.  While she loves it, kind of hard on my wallet.
__label__1 On line shopping is easy and computer friendly. Customer service is the best I've ever had the pleasure to do business with. Always polite and eager to get the customer what they need. Products are usually top quality.
__label__1 I don't buy a lot from qvc but when I want to check on items I can quickly do this now on my kindle....5 stars
__label__1 I use QVC often for certain brand name items and I really enjoy having this app at my fingertips so if I need anything--it is right there. I recommend it for anyone who loves NPR programs.
__label__1 I have been a customer for over 20 years.  And while there have been some &#34;duds&#34; the majority of my purchases have been GREAT.  (Just ask my charge account.)  No matter what you need they will have a selection for you.  I am more than satisfied.
__label__1 I LOVE QVC!!!This app makes it so easy to shop QVC! So easy to order if you need to get in before the item is sold out!

__label__1 If u love qvc like I do then get the app.Very ez to use just like going on your laptop:)
__label__1 you can' t go wrong with them. everything is easy to return no matter what it is and it's good quality items.
__label__0 It seems this edition does not allow or accept passwords so in my oplnion &#34;what's the point?&#34;. It could be the app is not Kindle compatible.
__label__1 Like having this on all my gadgets to keep up this the specials and what is coming up next plus the alerts for the shows I like even when not at home.
__label__1 THIS IS A GREAT APP TO HAVE ON YOUR TABLET. YOU GET RATINGS OF PRODUCTS AND SO MUCH MORE THAN SHOPPING ON THIS APP.
__label__1 really like this app I shop on my tablet a lot. but I also tried to find an hsn app but could not find one hope you get one of those soon
__label__1 I have been dealing with QVC for over 25 years.  They are a quality company the &#34;Q&#34; in QVC, that stands behind the products they sell.  Their service is fast, reliable, and always pleasant.
__label__1 I lie in bed at night looking at my QVC app in the dark till I fall asleep!  lol... Like a lullaby, I guess.... thinking of what to buy the next day.  Shop for clothing, jewelry, whatever... they have it all.
__label__1 I downloaded this for my Kindle only.  It's easy to navigate and I enjoy shopping in my jammies.  Good product.

__label__1 I love the way QVC is saving me money.  I especially love the Cooking with David; never miss him on Sundays.
__label__1 Of all the shopping channels this is the best of the bunch!!  The download app is free and you can do some great shopping on your phone or kindle without getting out of your chair.
__label__1 This app is great if you purchase from QVC.  It is better than doing it from the phone by far
__label__1 How could anyone not love having this on their tablet? Keeping up with what has been aired is fun. Not having a TV around is not a problem.
__label__1 Yep- it's QVC  but not in all it's glory.  Probably a better experience on something better than a 7&#34;  Product thumbnails are small  Going to a deeper screen doesn't help.  Order Status is limited.  Font is tiny, You'll need your glasses
__label__1 Uploaded the QVC app to my Fire quickly and easily. The layout is done very well and I love being able to look at everything QVC has to offer right at my finger tips! If you are a QVC fan I highly recommend getting this app.

__label__1 I love QVC.  I watch it all the time on TV.  And now I can watch it on my Kindle Fire.  In fact, I bought the Kindle Fire from QVC.
__label__1 So convenient to have this on my Kindle - easy to check the TSV and any other product at the tip of your fingers
__label__0 If I could give 0 stars, I would. App took forever to download. It was always hard to open, if it did at all. And I could never get it to let me look up or order anything. I finally deleted app and use web. Sorry QVC, just telling it like it is.
__label__1 I love the QVC App as I order a lot from QVC.  Glad I was able to get in on my kindle.
__label__1 QVC IS AN AWESOME PLACE TO SHOP!  IT'S SO HELPFUL TO SEE ITEMS PRESENTED AND INSTRUCTED ON USE.  LIVING IN A SMALL TOWN HAS IT'S DRAWBACKS, SUCH AS HAVING TO DRIVE AN HOUR FOR SHOPPING!  EASY PAY ADVANTAGE IS A GREAT OPTION TO STRETCH YOUR PAYMENTS OUT, 
__label__1 I enjoy shopping on QVC and prefer to order online, so I was pleased to find the app available for Kindle Fire.  Terrific viewing experience on the tablet, and I prefer it to using the app on my phone.  I have had no issues with the app on the Fire.
__label__1 if you are a qvc shopper this app is a must have .  allows you to place an order quickly or just browse and shop for things.

__label__1 Who doesn't love QVC!!!  I love that I can view my QVC specials while visiting relatives (and they don't even know that I'm shopping while talking to them)!
__label__1 Great app if you love QVC. It makes it easy to shop and inquire about different products. I have said all I need to.
__label__1 Good for looking up QVC items, but haven't figured out how to make a purchase using it, however. .Price is right.  FREE!
__label__1 I am using this on the HTC Evo 3D.  It is amazing.  Stability controls. A ton of various effects to check out. Easy to use and slick User Interface (much, much better in 3.0).  You can take a picture with both the front/back facing camera.  Voice activat
__label__1 This app is great! The camera on my Galaxy Attain did not have a zoom and I downloaded this app and it made it zoom. There are a lot of separate "packs" that you can can download to change your pics and enhance them. Overall, I can say that it is worth i
__label__0 THIS IS A SCAM! IT WOULD NOT LET ME INSTALL AND SAID I HAD NOT PURCHASED IT BUT NOW THERE IS A CHARGE ON MY CARD THAT SHOWED UP AFTER THE REFUND PERIOD!!!
__label__1 An all around superior camera.  I first started using it as a work around to the buggy stock camera on my Droid 3.  Very quick, responsive shutter.  Tons of *free* editing and filter add-ons!  This is the camera app that pros use when their SLR isn't han
__label__1 This app is very nice.  I use it instead of the camera app that came with the phone.  So many options. Its like a new toy.  I dont know what to play with first.  Well worth the price for the paid version.
__label__0 Was starting to work, than it froze my phone right up and had to remove the battery.  To bad because it looked like it was a good app.  Trying to get my money back.
__label__1 This has been my stock camera app for quite some time. I regularly get better pics from this app vs my stock camera on my Droid X. Whoever said you can't shut off the shutter sound is very wrong, by the way.This app has a crazy amount of free downloadabl
__label__0 Evo4g - FC constantly. Disabled stock cam. Dev responded quickly but could not resolve. Nice features but useless if unusable. Beware, this bonked my entire phone.
__label__1 Better than stock camera app. More options and my pictures look a lot better now. I have a Galaxy 3S and it really helps.
__label__1 i have bought several photo apps, but this one is so easy to use, and more options, i will use it a lot
__label__1 Oh my gosh, I was scared.The reviews said that it was bad.The reviews said it was not good.But try it.With full security.Oh, by the way, put helpful, please. I'll check it in 2 weeks.I wanna get to at least 30 helpful.Please. And thanks.
__label__0 Camera pictures upside down no matter what I seem to do horrible on my kindle hd and I used some of my free coins for this...not a happy camper what can I do to return this get my coins back
__label__0 The only thing that it does good is zoom, That's it. Aside from that, It's a freaking worthless and useless app and a flat out rip off for a 3 dollar charge. Thank god I got it for free.
__label__1 By far the best standard camera replacement for Android.  Even Lifehacker recommends this app to replace your standard camera.  It has many more filters and effects than the &#34;redheaded stepchild&#34; of camera apps (Instagram), it has smoother proces
__label__1 Its my favorite camera app. I already bought on google store, but i am glad that i got it on Amazon too. It only defect in the lack of video camera app (the app launch the integrated video camera app if you want to shoot videos). But when it comes to pho
__label__1 I used this app on my first kindle and on my cell phone,so I couldn't wait to download it to my kindle HDX...It works fantastically!! Effects and clarity are superb...keep up the good work guys!!
__label__1 I got this ap for 10 cents and uninstalled 2 other effects aps. It does have zoom and plenty of add on toys. Only ap better is HD paid from Amazon to really improve camera shots on Htc TB with 8 mp camera. Also can change to front camera in ap.  thanks d
__label__1 This camera app is better than the camera that came with my phone. It's amazing! Use this app with Pixlr-o-matic app. In doing so you'll get some amazing pictures! You can then create what you like!
__label__0 I hated this it is not like the one I have on my cell phone and it crashes a lot I would not use this  and I will be taking it off
__label__0 I don't really see the need for this app. Facebook messaging is pretty good all by itself. Pass on this app
__label__1 Downloaded this to my Fire so that i could keep in touch with FB friends while on the Kindle Fire.Works effortlessly...is easy to use...hasn't let me down yet!!!Won't be disappointed with this app if you are a big FB fan!!!
__label__0 I did not like this app. I uninstalled it. There were too many ads. It was not easy to install either.
__label__1 This is hands down the best app for chatting on Facebook, I just love it, it also comes with super cute animated kissy faces & such. My mom loved it so much that she also added the app to her computer.

__label__0 This app does not work for the Kindle Fire HD. I tried the app, and all it does is redirect you to the mobile Facebook page via an internet browser. Please bring the actual Facebook Messenger app to the Amazon Appstore.
__label__0 When I realized this was a chat app I immediately deleted it. Don't see the need for it at all with FB Msg.For those that like it, Carry on Dude!
__label__0 Same issues others had. Would not &quot;authenticate&quot; my account to log me into my Facebook. Could not use this app at all. Facebook just needs to make a messenger app themselves for Kindle Appetite.
__label__1 It helps me and my friend be on at the same time in chat. (Though I'm glad she trusts me for not answering them..erm..the messages 0: )I recommend you to use this apps.It lets you log into more than one account! :)I love it! I chosen this and it deserve

__label__0 anytime i would try to link my fb account it would just open facebook in the browser so i finally deleted it and got something else.
__label__1 This app is really easy to use,has notifications, and keeps track of messages when not logged on I recommend it
__label__1 This app was very informative and I used it all of the time. I love the articles that it has.
__label__0 I don't really understand why they even call this a tracker, it does nothing of the sort. It gives some information and tips on child care, but nothing you couldn't find by simply visiting their website on your mobile device. Baby ESP is the best baby tr
__label__0 In my opinion, anyone with a kindle fire should not get this app because it doesn't vibrate at all. I should have listened to the other reviews and not have gotten this. I'm going to delete this app now.
__label__0 this game shouldn't even b a real app because it is so stupid. do not get this game!!!!!!trust me its stupid all it does is makes a buzzing sound!
__label__0 waste of your f****n time like really all it does isvmake sounds it sounds like u r cutting hair but all it is is a blank screen with a razor in the middle and it vibrates ur phone or tablet. it is stupid do not get but I bet u got it by know if u r read

__label__1 With the glut of crap Android games out there, this one is a gem!  Fortunes of War is a trading card game that's easy to learn and totally absorbing.  The game play is uncomplicated but does require some strategic thinking.The artistic style of the card 
__label__1 Test device:  Samsung Epic, Android 2.2I never really got into the trading card games like Magic and the like, but got a passing familiarity with them and how they are played.  I decided to go ahead and give Fortunes of War a shot, mostly because I liked
__label__1 This is a strategy game with  lots of depth.  in the single player campaign, every level requires a different approach, sometimes you want to be aggressive, other times defensive, and still other times its just a race to the top.  the torn card style wor
__label__1 This is really a clever take on the CCG. It resembles Dominion by Rio Grande Games in many aspects. You begin with a limited supply deck from which you can purchase cards that give you victory points, income or abilities. As these are purchased, they ent
__label__0 There isn't really much to do with the free version. Seems like an ad for the paid version. Want more before considering a purchase.
__label__1 I liked this game so much that I purchased the paid version. Lots of card options. Plays differently every time.
__label__0 hate it. so boring. ugly!!  uugggg!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  ! ! ! ! !! ! ! ! ! ! ! !! ! !
__label__1 Had a power outage last night and my daughter pulled this app up as a bit of humor. We both enjoyed it- it is a very cute app! Its a bit of old time nostalgia meets the techno age but reminds of us simpler times!
__label__1 Very neat app. Thanks to the creators, and keep up the good work. Works great on Cruz t408 very customizable.
__label__1 This app is very AMAZING!!!!!! I could see no adds and it was fun for me, I could and did play with it for with hours!!!!!!
__label__0 no point to it. it does nothing. if u want a good all try angry birds. this app is a waste of your time. don't get it
__label__0 Basically just a candle on a screen and you can adjust the flame.  If you want to waste time watching a candle then get it.
__label__1 I have a kindle fire hd and daughter has a kindle fire.  This app works on both.  She loves to use it at night, almost like a night-light, only its brighter.  With the sleep mode on the kindle, it doesn't stay on all night so its great for her to go to s
__label__1 My dog hates to have me stay up. She sleeps at the end of my bed, so when I want to go on the Kindle Fire and need extra light, I use my candle. Its really pretty and unique.
__label__1 This "Candle" app is just a little bit of fun for my HTC EVO 4G (Android v2.3.3) and Kindle Fire. We are professional candle makers, so like all things candle related.The app displays the top of a taper candle with an animated flame that reacts to the mo
__label__1 My son told me about this app and I have used it quite a few times.  At night when one doesn't want turn on a light this is perfect to give enough light to see where you're going.  Also use it when coming in from the car as we don't have street lights.
__label__1 Nothing is as good as a real candle of course but this is really cool. When you rotate your kindle the flame bends like a real flame. It really is nice,  I dont think it is animated I think its a real candle.
__label__1 This is a great app for the easily amused like me. It can be a little tricky to exit at first.
__label__0 This app is boring all you do is watch fire and touch it then it blows out it's to bad I can't take back my star:(
__label__1 In need of flameless candles that won't catch your table cloth on fire?  This app is for you!  It works well for setting that perfect romantic occasion.
__label__1 I haven't had much cause to use this yet, but the novelty is so worth it.  You can even blow it out!
__label__1 This is by far the coolest thing! I have yet to find a good purpose for it, but its simply that entertaining. You can extinguish the flame with your finger, and have the candle change colors! The best is that the flame looks extremely real!
__label__1 I love this app! You can change so many things!( candle color, flame color, smoke color and background color!) If you have a microphone on your device you can even blow out the candle! Fun app but not a game, kids
__label__1 This is really cool. You can change the color of the candle and the flame. If your tablet has a microphone you can blow it out. It is awesome. :),
__label__1 Remember - this is not a business app, it is not a gaming app, you are getting EXACTLY what the app says it is. A candle. It lights like a candle, behaves like a candle, lets you pick a color for your candle and is nice for creating a romantic atmosphere
__label__1 This is one of the coolest things they have come out with in a long time. It serves no purpose other than just being a neat toy!
__label__0 I installed it on my Kindle and it worked the first time, but would never work again so I deleted it.
__label__1 All the fun of playing with fire, without the consequences!Although, you should NEVER play with fire under ANY circumstances...it can be dangerous.
__label__1 I like this for roaming around the house in the wee hours of the night.  It does not disturb my sleeping family and gives me enough light to keep from tumbling down the stairs or stunning toes.This light tool does not shock your eyeballs.  Nice atmospher
__label__0 this is a dumb app u don't even do anything on this app just watch a candle burn and move. that's it how dumb u cant even change the color of the flame or candle. no use downloading it cuz u will just delete it after u try it.
__label__1 Watching the responses of the people who see me blow out the candle (you can!) is interesting. Most just seem to accept it as ho-hum. This tells me they don't have a clue about electronics.
__label__0 Will not, does not want to work.  Waste of time and effort attempting to load.  Had higher hopes, but all my best wishes for this product were for not.  Probably works better on a smart phone or iPod Touch.
__label__1 It's very simple but good to have. Sometimes I use it as a source of light, sometimes when I can't fall a sleep or want to relax
__label__1 Too cool for words.  You can even move the flame around when candle is out and you touch the candle wax and not the wick (ghost flame...ooooo!).
__label__0 This is just a flickering candle. Nothing special really. I would not waste my space on anything for this. Not worth it!
__label__1 I really like this app you can change background, candle, flame andsmoke color. very cool! the ads are small and doesn't bother me at all. love it
__label__1 Woohoo! I have a candle on my kindle! Yayyy! Ok, there's not really much of a point to this app, but it's kind of cool anyway.
__label__1 It works fine, is a decent little play thing, and can be nice little mood setter. I don't use it often, but I do occasionally play with it,
__label__1 I am not sure if I am bemused or confused by the low-raters who gave this app just one star because it was 'too boring' for them. Have any of them ever seen a _real_  candle? With a real candle, you light it, and it's lit. You move it, and the flame wave
__label__1 i got this ap purely for the fun of it as a silly answer to all those fshlight apps :)
__label__1 I'm kind of a pyro, so this a very safe alternative to actual flame. I love being able to change the colors of everything. I also recomend the lighter app if you like this one.
__label__1 when my husband is sleeping and i have to leave the room for a moment i out this app on no navigate through my room. works fine.
__label__0 Uninstalled
__label__1 I like this candle toy.  It is not intended to be a fancy game but it does what I wanted, just watch it and think clean thoughts.
__label__1 I want to use this when the power goes out. It is just perfect. Works just as it says and it is super pretty. Plus, no worries about burning down the house. :)
__label__1 Used it last month when the power went out to find my way back to the room with the real candles. It really works and is not just for show. Pink fuzzies to the creators of this app. Thanks. Will be fun to use it while camping.
__label__1 It's a nice little candle. Looks like the real thing. I have a kindle fire and it works on it. You can't blow it out using Kindle fire but you can touch the wick and put the flame out or start it again. It does have ads but I don't find them annoying. I 
__label__1 want a candle lit dinner for two?  just fire up you kindle, turn out the lights and there you go.  it looks and acts just like a candle except it doesn't get hot, drip wax or get the least little bit warm.  gives an almost real ambiance, actually romanti
__label__0 Its sooooo stupid! I don't even get the purpose for this app....it just does the same thing over and over and over again. Its just a waste of space. DONT GET IT!!!
__label__1 this app is fantastic, great, soothing, awesome, and sooo great!!!  it would be so cool if u could blow it out on the kindle fire!  I know it seems boring but so glad I got it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
__label__0 This is probably the lamest app I've come across.....ever. No clue why I even bothered installing it. Real candles are way more interesting.
__label__1 I've had this for some time. It works well on Kindle Fire HD. If you just want a break from it all.
__label__1 This makes a good low light.  For those of you complaining about it: 1) it is supposed to be a low light, 2) it is a UTILITY, not a game, and 3) you should only complain about it if it doesn't work on your machine.
__label__1 Why didn't I think of putting a candle on my Kindle Fire?  Oh, right, the warranty and wax and heat.  Everything Progimax touches is golden.
__label__1 Good way to organize my apps that looks nice, and doesn't cover the whole screen like the folders do for my Incredible2.
__label__1 CircleLauncher lets you place widgets on your screen each holding either apps, bookmarks or contacts (no mixing allowed) and, when you tap on the widget's icon, all the objects associated with the widget are displayed in a circle or a bar (horizontal or 
__label__1 Easy to use, cleans up panels. Think of it as folders for apps, contacts etc. Plenty of color and design choices for the widget. I now have buttons and lines of varying size, design and color on my DROID X2 - looks very clean and organized. Thanks Amazon
__label__1 I like this app better than "application folder". It is  quick and responsive when I try to access shortcuts through it. There are lots of features which is great!Still needs:1. better layout that handles shortcuts for more than 10 apps in one widget.2. 
__label__0 I really don't appreciate when companies try cramming extra garbage into their apps and don't even respect you enough to acknowledge what they're adding in. I did enjoy using this launcher, but who knows what else they are sneaking into this app. More th
__label__1 This app is a great way to save space and have all the Apps you use most on your he page. Highly recommended, get it today.
__label__0 I downloaded this app when it was offered free for the day. I thought it was a really neat app until a day later, some of my apps started disappearing. Not cool! I uninstalled it. Beware before you get this app.
__label__1 Simple, clean and handy. This basically is a short cut for your widgets.  The way it is organized makes it easy to launch your most used apps with one thumb. I am really enjoying the convenience of this app and appreciate the clutter clean-up. Works well
__label__1 CircleLauncher helped me to clean up home screens on my Toshiba Thrive.  I have created several launchers by theme (games, organizer, photo and video apps) and placed them on the home screens instead of the multitude of icons.  The home screens look very
__label__1 I tried the free version as as soon as I figured out how it worked (couple of minutes) I decided to bought the paid version. Im really glad I did I because CircleLauncher lets you group apps, contacts and shortcuts in a very cool and neat way while helps
__label__1 I tried other programs similar, and this is the slickest and most practical. If something is out of sight, it's out of my mind, so I love that the icons each hide tons of apps. It launches fast, and it's easy to see/read what you have. It also is fast. I
__label__1 This app gives me a nifty way to keep all my app shortcuts in a neat and cool way. The transparency option makes it a favorite
__label__1 Here is a favorable review of circlelauncher. It does a great job at being a good widget. Way to go dev.
__label__1 I love this app! I can put all my apps on my homepages, grouped like I want. Well worth the dollar cost!! Fantastic app! Droid X.
__label__1 Great app! It is EASY to set up, looks great, and works flawlessly on my HTC Incredible. I love that I can now select my most often used apps with one click, and my home screen is clutter free. I use the folder editor app on one screen to categorize all 
__label__1 I really like this app. Does take some time to set up. If the app isn't set up right the first time, no worries, just send the oops to the trash bin and try again.
__label__1 This app is great for older phones with a small screen (LG Ally). Trash all the cluttered Icons and add this widget to the home screen. Would have paid a $1 for this app.
__label__1 I absolutely love how this app allows you to have multiple shortcuts to all your selected apps in a 1x1 real estate space on your home screen. Less is definitely more, and this app reinforces that fact!The icon itself may not be the most beautiful, but t
__label__1 This app/widget is amazing. It makes life easier than before. Additionally it makes things more beautiful than just using folders. iOS users who have seen this were jealous! I love it. Well worth the price!
__label__0 This app can make phone calls without your permission! Homey don't play that. This is the first launcher I have seen that phrased it quite that ominously. No way will it find its way onto my phone.
__label__1 This app is great. It saves space on your home screen by allowing you to organize all similar apps or contacts into single 1x1 icons.
__label__1 "CircleLauncher" is a clever app that allows one icon on the home screen to be used to quickly launch apps that you preselect to be shown when you press the launch button. Setup and configuration of the app is very straight forward and it easy to make ch
__label__0 I halted the install and could not think of any reason an app like this needed permission to access my browser history.
__label__1 whoever developed this app os a genius!  its just what I needed to organize my apps and contacts. it compressed my home screen into just one simple button, my favorite contacts into one button and my favorite games into one button. I highly recommend thi
__label__1 This app does what it promises. Nice way to de&ndash;clutter my home screen. Works great on DroidX. Like that I can have multiple varying sized circles of shortcuts, Apps, etc instead of just the usual grid of shortcuts, folders all lined up like neat li
__label__1 i dont generally review free appofthe day, but this one is really nice.  it is basically a homescreen folder replacement that looks a lot better and with more options.
__label__1 Finally a useful widget free from the appstore. I like it much better than having to use folders.. best free app. in a long time
__label__1 This is by far one of my favorite apps &amp; makes organizing my collection of apps easy. I have icons organized &amp; labelled according to subject or catagory, such as audio, video, app mgmt, camera, etc. I also have many game apps &amp; have them orga
__label__1 Pretty good.  Now I can arrange my apps in a better way, like it. Got it for free, sweet. There are more spaces on my phone now.
__label__1 I love to hear people complain like they do about a free app.  there is nothing wrong with this app it does what it says and works like described.  I would have gladly paid the 1.00 price for this app.  it greatly de-cluttered my home screen

__label__1 this is a good launcher and the different styles and colors are what sold me on it. reduced some clutter on my homescreens as well
__label__0 Does absolutely nothing on Honeycomb Asus Transformer. Doesn't even appear in the list of Widgets. Maybe Amazon and Developers ought to be a bit more diligent before listing Apps as compatible with various devices and versions.
__label__1 This is a great App launcher. It's exactly what I was looking for.I like Wave Launcher, but CircleLauncher having different launch groups linked to different launch buttons on your home screen is a very nice feature.I love being able to have more icons a

__label__1 This is so much better than folders! I love how easily they come up and pop back down, and doesn't distract from the screen. Setup is easy and I like how you can go in afterwards and further reconfigure it without having to reload it. Very useful, I high
__label__1 Keeps your screen clean and gives you a nice,  neat,  attractive method of launching your apps.  Very customizable,  and reliable.  No force close,  no errors.Galaxy S II
__label__1 This app not only redunces clutter of multipule icons on the home screen, but by grouping apps together allowing better organization.  Streak 2.2)
__label__1 This app is ready to use and customize. It is great to put my frequently used apps in the circle instead of going through multiple home screens.
__label__1 Very easy to set up and modify, much better than I was expecting. Definite must-have, especially if you love customization on your home screen. Thank you very much Amazon for the Faotd, I appreciate it.HTC EVO 4G
__label__1 This is a fantastic app for removing clutter from your home pages. It works much like having folders on your desktop, but it is much cleaner and has a better look to it then any other app I've seen to date
__label__1 So I was thinking about purchasing this app and then I realized it was free. Any-who, wow it's amazing. Works.wonders on my Samsung Galaxy Tab 7. Highly recommend it. :-)
__label__1 This idea was the first of it's kind and I never saw it used before. I enjoy the circle launcher and it's a useful shortcut to some of my favorite apps, looks good as well.
__label__1 This is hands down one of the best free apps I've gotten from the Amazon Appstore.  It's definitely worth a buck if you have to pay for it though.  It's easy to use and cleans up your apps nicely.  I have a ton of apps and before this app had a cluttered
__label__1 this is super cool. si te quiere leer este en espanol, no te puede por que mi gramatica es terrible.
__label__1 Great app that helps you organize and reduce clutter.  Easy to use and very customizable. Highly recommend.  Go ahead and buy it now!
__label__1 Awesome widget!Wish you could save a widget presets to use again and again. Or sort Apps like Application Folder or Folder Manager.Wish the app list showed the app image.
__label__1 This just saved my one screen a whole lot of real estate.  Live it,  hope it continues to work and be updated when needed.  Thank CL Devs!
__label__1 This is a very handy &quot;widget&quot; that does exactly what it is designed for.  Actually it is awesome!  There will always be some morons that don't understand how to follow instructions.This is a great app! Thanks Amazon!
__label__1 I love how I can hide apps under the main icon, it keeps my screen clean and neat. One tap and there's my favorite games!
__label__1 If you love apps, you will definitely love this one. Transparent, so I can enjoy my home screen, or any screen for that matter.  Can generate any type of launcher to suit my needs. This helps  organize apps by using classifications that fit my style and 
__label__0 Touch screen stopped working after installing.  Did a battery pull worked for a minute and froze again. Did second battery pull unistalled,  no more problems.  Buyer beware
__label__1 This is a GREAT replacement for using folders on your screen.  I can group the apps I want together and it keeps my screen nice and uncluttered. I have a background picture for a reason, and I like to see it. This helps a lot.
__label__1 I'm not exaggerating. I have been able to organize my entire device. I get to my apps faster. No more scrolling through the entire apps drawer and forgetting what I was looking for.MyTouch 4G
__label__1 I love this. It's just what I wanted. I don't need to clog up my front screen and I also don't need to switch to the side windows by scrolling left and right. Very good and extremely customizable. Worth the buck and of course thanks go to Amazon for givi
__label__1 This is a great widget.  I have been using it since it was first introduced.  It can be used in so many ways.  I use it as a stealth launcher on a homescreen with clock.  Awesome
__label__1 This app has become a must for me. it puts all my key apps at my fingertips in an organized fashion.
__label__1 This is a really smart app, total space saver and organizer. I now have these on my home screen grouping my apps together based on function and each launcher labeled appropriately
__label__1 These are the sorts of things that can't be done on non-jailbroken iPhones.  It really cleans up the user interface.

__label__1 this app is a great way to organize your Apps and contacts for fast, easy access. great thing is that you can have many circle launchers, organize different types of Apps in them and label them. very well worth the $1.00 especially if you have a lot of A
__label__1 This it's one of my favorite apps to date. I like clean looking home screens. With this app I can make the widget transparent and barely visible yet with a quick tap I can have the apps and contacts within easy reach. Would like an option for direct text
__label__1 this app is fantastic. I use to have an iphone, and got sick of the uncustomizable home screens. This is what android life is all about.
__label__1 I grabbed this when it was the FAOTD a while back and I have used it on my home screen ever since. I love using it for my most common contacts, so I can access them with a touch.I will be buying this on Google as soon as the developers work out the bugs 
__label__0 If you're planning on using this on a Honeycomb tablet, don't bother. They don't say anything in the description, but this app is not supported on Android 3.x
__label__1 This is a very cool way to maximize the amount of space on your smartphone's home screen. An excellent way to organize your app shortcuts while reducing the clutter.
__label__1 I've been using the lite version of this for a few months now and I loved it from the start. Theres nothing fancy about it, so I don't want to over sell it...its basically a folder with some style to it. To sum it all up, I shouldve paid a dollar for thi
__label__1 If you run out of space on your home screens this is an awesome idea. You just press the app and more apps that you set appear.

__label__0 if u like circlelauncher you'll love wave launcher. with wave launcher im able to pull up a screen shot app and take a pic of what im doing ie.. during game playn. or flick on an app real fast while talking on the phone.  so on and so on.  you can be a l
__label__1 This is a pretty simple but effective app. It helps save real estate on your home screen while giving you fast access to 8-12 additional apps. A dollar well spent!
__label__1 this app helps clear the clutter of apps that usually cover a screen. the app is great because you can group apps together under one icon and then label them for ease of access. the best thing is that it clears a cluttered screen and apps are accessed wi
__label__1 Saves space and your not just limited to just one slot on your homescreen.  Use games for one,apps for another, it's great!Thanks developer, and a thanks to Amazon for all your doing to help the android community
__label__1 This is the best Android launcher I've seen in the last 3 years!  How could it have taken a dev this long to dream up such an elegant design?  Totally worth $1, although I got it for free :  Just get it!
__label__1 I was skeptical until I tried it. Fantastic applications and the type that needs to be app of the day more often. Put the circle widget on screen and select applications. Then when you tap it they show around the circle and you can launch.
__label__1 CircleLauncher is an indispensable app/widget on my phone, an HTC EVO 3d. It's something Google or HTC should have incorporated into their user interfaces. Elegant and practical way to save valuable screen space.
__label__1 perfect way to clean up your homescreen. use it everyday. love the different icon packs as well. you will not be disappointed.
__label__1 HTC EVO this is amazing It took 20 minutes to reorganize my face page and it was worth it. When I realize you can have multiple icons with different apps or bookmarks saved that's when I realized how cool &amp; efficient this app was. Prior to this app S
__label__1 The app works great and clears up a lot of clutter. I don't see any lag when it's being launched. Had I known about this app earlier I would have gladly paid for it.

__label__1 I just downloaded CircleLauncher and tried out the widget. It's a interesting little thing. May help unclutter your home screen.I placed it on an unused page and loaded up about 8 apps.  clicking on the widget brought them up in a circle on the screen.  
__label__1 This isn't a sexy or "cool" app but it is extremely useful.  Setup a productivity, photography, or game launcher and put your favorite apps in. Make the launcher a circle or a drop down list.  Change the background by blurring it out or shading it darker
__label__1 really like this app and that i have only 3 home screens since 70+ apps launch thru 9 themed circle launchers!
__label__1 My 2 y/o loves it.
__label__1 My two year old loves this app. It takes a good amount of space but it is well worth it. The picture and sounds are vibrant and clear. Great app. I highly recommend it.
__label__1 My 3 year old loves this and plays it all the time. He especially likes to imitate all the sounds. Ended up upgrading to the better version.
__label__0 I liked st first don't remember it talking but now it does and my 2 year old is smart knows all his animals and there sound also same with vehicles and the noise they Make I know this is free but geese um at least have the right names and sounds so we ar
__label__1 My children are grown, but I got this app for a friend's child to amuse her while Mom stepped out for a bit.  This app was engrossing enough for the little girl that she hardly noticed that Mommy was gone, and now every time I see her she wants to see.  
__label__1 He loves this app he calls it the moo be aide he loves the cow on it makes watching my baby brother so much easier thank you
__label__0 This baby game was acting really messed up, and was making my Kindle slow. The app is also very boring for babies and others alike, which I found out once it had finally finished loading. Don't get.
__label__1 I don't got no kids I bought this 4 the heck of it I'm 10 this Thang is soo fun!!!!
__label__0 Looks good. Baby chooses from a category shown with cartoon icons.  A pic of the real "thing" is shown and the name of the thing is spoken.  Then the baby is provided with a completely different sound.  A truck may sound like a train.  The goat tweets. O
__label__1 My sister can NOT get her eyes off my kindle when ever she is playing it. U get 2 touch things (such as animals, interments, and household items. I think u should get it * only if ur geting it for a baby or kid.
__label__0 Just downloaded this and very disappointed. When you click on a picture the person says something different. For example, my daughter clicked on a donkey and the speech said &quot;Dog! Ruff ruff!&quot;. I will be deleting this app as it will surely only 
__label__0 My child did not like this app.  I did not like it.  We got the interactive books for here.  I like them a lot.
__label__1 my toddler absolutely loves this app.  the icons are big and easy enough that he can hit them his self.  there are plenty of objects to include the ones he knows with new ones for him to learn.
__label__1 Seems to be a well thought out piece of software.  It also has a section for a user name and password input per site. This is how I get my radio shows that I can't listen to for one reason or another.  It is detailed, so powerful, which is another way of
__label__1 As I enjoy Old Time Radio finding an application for my Motorola Droid X became a must do task.After a number of trials I settled on MyPod.  It has been reviewed as being too difficult to learn and use.  I will concede that it has somewhat of a learning 
__label__0 Imagine if someone who'd never seen or used a computer or listened to a podcast were tasked with designing the UI for a podcast manager. What you'd get would almost certainly not be as badly designed as this. It's literally easier for me to just remember
__label__0 I finally found the right calorie counter that keeps track of your daily food intake AND your exercise calories burned and it's printable so if you're keeping track for six months you have a record!
__label__0 this list of about 100 things is very unuseful. Adclick should rethink this app and add about 5000 more foods. then we could use it. I will now delete it and search elsewhere.
__label__1 Nice app on my Kindle Fire 7&#34; HD. Very quickly finds calories associated with various foods. I use it in conjunction with my written record of daily intake of food.
__label__0 All the assessment s are incorrect. The listings are extremely limited. If you try to loose weight using this for a tool you are apt to gain weight instead. Even if the product is free it should be accurate
__label__0 This app is TERRIBLE and has very little information. It lists crazy things..ready?.In the eggs section.4 kinds ..and 1 is quail eggs.REALLY??Not worth  it.And its free ..thx  mary ann
__label__0 This game would have had a okay concept if you could get it to work. The game will start but will crash before you can even get to the middle of the first level. I deleted this game off my kindle and suggest that you don't get this game.
__label__0 it is so dumb just get angry birds PLEASE I NEG YOU DO NOT GET THIS APP it is the WORST app ever it is so stupid it is not a good app plzzzzzzzzzzzzz do not get this app it is boring
__label__1 loveitloveit. I love this game so much and I hope everybody else does to bro. (me and bro game get along).
__label__0 It worked fine for me on my kindle fire, but the game its self just sucked really bad... The worst App I've downloaded yet.
__label__0 I was hoping for the Word Worm game that is for pc's.  The layout on this faugh  word game is distracting the color is awfulIt refuses common words. ---No fun.
__label__1 I love word searches and this game is a challenge. I would recommend this game to anyone who likes a challenge. thanks Amazon for offering this free app of book worm
__label__1 This is a great game! My computer is down and I miss my bookstore game. But this version for kindle is so similar, I have really enjoyed it.
__label__1 I love word games.  This is great!!!!  It is not hard to figure out.  It is a challenge.  Amazon has some pretty good games for phones- tablets-pc's-and kindle fire.
__label__0 Really not very impressed with the game. Doesn't drop letters in any pattern that you can use to make words. Too many Consenance together, no vowels.
__label__0 This is not what I thought and am highly disappointed. I played Worm Word on the computer and that is what I thought I was ordering. That is what it described and showed when I ordered. But when I went to my Kindle, it was this game and not half as good.
__label__1 I have searched for a game comparable to Bookworm for years. Finally, I have found it!! I am so happy right now!! Great game!!
__label__1 I love this game and play it often.  It is such a challenge to try and beat the letters that are going to inevitably blow me away.
__label__1 I love word games and used to play bookstore yahoo. I lose track of time playing this game! I just recently downloaded it but so far no complaints! Great job.
__label__0 This game leaves a lot to be desired for someone who enjoys word games.  The dictionary is poor and there is little to no challenge.
__label__1 Love to play this game in all modes. Helps me unwind and think at the same time. Could really use a better word dictionary..many words I Know are correct the game does not recognize. Still fun.
__label__0 I'd give it no stars but apparently that isn't possible.  You can't play it, the game just stops unexpectedly.  Deleted it off my device already.
__label__1 Only change would like to see is either a better scoring system for the untimed version or just let you play untimed, unscored and unstopped.  Like creating as many words as possible but don't like playing with a timer....and that's purely personal.  As 
__label__1 This game is adictting! Sometimes I stay up to 1:00 am playing it when I should be sleeping cause I work. Worth buying!
__label__1 This is a fun and addicting game.  I can waste hours playing this.  My 8 yr old grand daughter loves it too.  I would recommend it for kids and adults.
__label__1 I like this app for my kindle fire. It's fun and challengingI don't understand the bad reviews for it.
__label__0 horrible graphics, unreadable.  nothing like bookworm.  don't try it. was of money.  big purchase mistake.  just learning.  will not repeat my mistake
__label__1 This is the best App,/ I have ever found,,install it in your Kindle,by all means,,easy  application,easy to understand,,great result,,Recommend for Kindle Fire,,you will hear it in the next room,!!Regardless of what the other Nerds Say in the reviews,,Yo
__label__1 This ape was recommend bon a forum and I must say it was exactly what I need to increase the volume of the speakers on my phone. The I initially got it for my speaker phone feature but I must say it took my stock music player to another level
__label__1 I had trouble with it at first but then realized I  didnt download it right and after I did it worked great
__label__1 It does exactly what I need it to, boost the volume on my kindle speakers. I've never gone above 11, so I have no idea how loud it can actually get, but usually anywhere from 9-11 is more than enough.
__label__1 This little program did in fact boost the volume on my Kindle Fire and I love the program.  Highly recommended!
__label__1 had this for a few weeks finally decided to try it out on my kindle fire which as you may have heard by now has terrible sound I mean its great for background noise or when u want to hold it close to you but yeah it sucks. anyway finally gave this a try 
__label__1 I love this app, It improves the sound quality and volume of the basic Kindle Fire (2nd generation).If you are looking for a better way to increase the sound for music, videos and the silk browser. This app is for you!
__label__1 I have hearing nerve damage and even with high powered hearing aids my hearing can only be restored to around 60%.  Distortion is another problem.  One of my favorite programs is Downton Abbey but often I have a hard time understanding but I just gave it
__label__1 I don't know how it works, but it honestly makes the kindle quite a bit louder! I was totally shocked!
__label__1 Yes it works great on the kindle Fire want to test itrun Pandora and set your main volume about half way then goto the Volume app and play with the controls remember there are twooptions speakers or headphones.You do need to be careful because it could g
__label__1 For me this is especially helpful while using the phone to play my music with an aux jack in the car &amp; it makes a big difference I was so surprised. I have tried others &amp; haven't noticed any difference. Using LG optimus s with custom gingerbread 
__label__1 I hadn't checked this app out, figuring that it was strictly for volume...but this app also provides an equalizer (which even most players don't), and one which doesn't require an engineering degree to use!  So crank up up the bass boost or a variety of 
__label__0 The new Kindle hdx is a very nice tablet - except for external volume which is not loud enough.  This app didn't help.
__label__1 Ive a Fire 8.9 HD, and I grabbed this app today. Works wonderfully. Boosted up my speaker volume, on kindle, my independent speakers, now to try my Bluetooth speaker out and see if it brings up the volume.Now my radio apps sound much better, my downloade
__label__1 I am so happy I got this volume control app. I have been using Bluetooth headset or speakers but it can be really inconvenient for casual listening. This works exactly as described. If you are an audiophile you may not be happy with the quality of music 
__label__0 AS others, tweaked all settings, tried everything - simply does not work. I had high hopes because Kindle Fire volume is pretty bad from factory. Shame and want my money back.
__label__1 It works great on kindle fire and now I can play my music louder, just don't set it high or it will damage your speakers
__label__1 This Really Works!It is amazing!I can now watch netflix without headphones! Best 2bucks I have spent! This really gives you lots of options when it comes to your sound on the kindle fire.
__label__0 I want my money back,I try with different apps.my own files,tune in,music Fm,shared, audiobooks,etc this app Does NOT work on kindle fire, how can I sue the owner.is useless.
__label__1 I have to say that I was a little skeptical about purchasing this app,  but it was WELL worth it. Volume+ gets an A+ in my book. Awesome App!!!
__label__0 I downloaded this app thinking it would help make my kindle speakers better on account that they suck (hello amazon are you listening! ) well this app does not help! there is no noticeable difference. Save your money and just download speaker booster for
__label__0 I have a kindle fire HD and this app removes the firm hard hitting bass.  There is no setting that improves the sound in any way.  sorry, but this app is a complete waste.
__label__0 This app worked as promised for all of 25 SECONDS, after that it stopped effecting my sound.  Will send it to the cloud until updates come out.  Do not recommend for Kindle Fire.
__label__1 I have a rooted Kindle Fire running CM7 and this app boosted my volume level by 200%. I can now hear the internal speakers from 10 feet away outside!
__label__1 I dont know what the other reviewers are doing, but I tested this app on the stock Kindle Fire max volume levels for the Hulu app, Netflix App, Amazon Prime App and on youtube.  On all the tests, this app dramatically increased audio levels on my device.
__label__0 I couldn't get it to work. My kindle's volume was not high enough so I bought this. I't didn't seem to help
__label__0 This app doesn't work, when i try to use custom eq ,the sound reduces considerably low making terrible noises ,i completely regret buying this crap that doesn't work i wonder how in the world this app gets 4 stars,it got me completely duped..save your mo
__label__1 The amount this raises the speakers on my unrooted Kindle Fire is fantastic. it turned a horrifically low volume device into a wonderful and loud device. Thanks dev! Only one suggestion: have it begin automatically on reboot, not a major deal, just would
__label__1 the volume on the kindle fire doesn't quite work for me. I like watching netflix while I'm grilling swimming bathing. now I can hear.
__label__0 It did not like this because it just didn't seem to do a thing for the stuff.I just deleted it.
__label__0 Absolutely no difference on kindle fire. Volume was measured before installation and post. Unfortunately nothing had changed. Highly suspect the &quot;great&quot; reviews came from rooted kindle fire owners. Shame...
__label__0 This is nothing, no information at all! I did not even keep it for a day. That is how bad it is!
__label__0 This was a very poor app.  You can get more information by going toyour state government site and look under there various sites onfarming, agriculture and etc.  Remember with Kindle Fire, once youdownload its there for good.  Safe the Cloud space.  Don'
__label__0 Its just a  very basic doc with info a 4th grader could have written. (with apologies to 4th graders everywhere)
__label__1 this app is okish but all it does is tell you tips on your lawn. I think that it is a waist of app space
__label__1 The Green Lawns Made Easy! ap is pretty informative, especially for someone who lived in the city with concrete all around & now resides in Dandridge Tennessee with so much grass, weeds & beautifil farms.
__label__0 This app was not worth $2.99 it should be free I deleted it, It was the worst, I use to love the game show Name that Tune, nothing like that and was very poor, also didn't work properly and kept freezing.....
__label__0 i dont own this app but ...if its guessing a somg kind of game you might as well get a game called songpop there is a free version and an ad free one for half the price of this game...you can even play socially with people and there are different genres 
__label__0 Vincent you really need to buy an English book. Your use of the English language is deplorable.  Wishing you luck with your studies.
__label__0 This app is a waste of money. If you what a good game. Get something like blood and glory. Its much better then this rip off.
__label__0 waste of money people 5$ and all you get is a sucky game do not buy this game shouldn't even be. 99
__label__0 did not like this at all. was boring. not good names at all and kept repeating the same ones over and over again.
__label__1 I only got this cuz if u have a bunch of ag dolls and you cant figure out a name this helps alot
__label__0 I don't like this app at all you will not like. no one will like it at all it stinks so don't get trust me its bad
__label__1 people need to calm down and get over themselves its a cute app and fun to see all the different names that pop up
__label__1 I love bananas,and I love when that weird man says &quot;banana&quot;.my freind and I laugh when I say banana.cute game.:)
__label__0 this game is probly the worst game for kindle fire or any other type of tablet don't waste your time!!!
__label__1 This is one of my favorote games! I didn't even have it for a day yet. The guy that says banana sounds just like my dad therefor it's hilarious. The only downside is that you can not save your bananna's outfit. Other than than that it is a great game wit
__label__1 My son is 4 and loves this game! It is so simple and silly, but he loves it and that is what matters : )
__label__1 i have not played it yet but i love banana's so much i know i will love it and yes i am kinda crazy
__label__0 &quot;Very basic&quot; is too complex of a description for this &quot;interactive story.&quot; With single sentence pages, no music, barely any sound effects, narration that sounds like someone sitting at their office PC, bland visuals, and one touch spo
__label__0 my children are 5 and 3. both said that's it? the animation and interaction were both seriously lacking. the story was weak. I would not recommend it.
__label__1 This book is beautiful in every way! Love the story, love the illustrations!!! You can read it to your child or your child can choose the read to me option and the book will read to them!! My daughter loves it!!!
__label__1 I really like this wallpaper.  My only problem is that the configuration screen is totally unreadable.  Otherwise, awesome!  Nice visual aid.
__label__1 I has no effect on battery life but looks so cool. It is pretty basic though, the Droid just melts and eyes glow. Does everything it says. I would love an update to maybe add some change for when you plug your device in, maybe change the eye color? Idk i
__label__1 I love showing it off to my husband. it is just too cute. would be cool if there was customization.
__label__1 Looks great on htc evo 4G. I let my battery die, just to watch the android melt all the way. This wallpaper doesn't seem to drain the battery as much as other live wallpapers.
__label__1 This is a really good wallpaper. It looks great and works well. I haven't seen any change in battery life. No problem recommending this one.
__label__1 this application is so cool my only issues is i keep turning the screen on so i can watch him grow. i wish i could change him to a different color other then that great application
__label__1 idk what some people are talking about, I have the evo 4G and the battery time is known to not be the best. but the depletion of my battery has very very little to do with this live background. I have been using this background since before I saw it on a
__label__1 absolutely love this app. subtle and cute. does what it says without adding to the battery drain. give it a shot, you won't be disappointed.
__label__0 I have installed and uninstalled this many times, but it will not run.It doesn't show in my apps list, my widget list, or anywhere else. Fortunately, it shows in my mManage Applications lost so I can uninstall it.
__label__1 REVISED: Cool ap. Finally loaded and works and looks pretty cool. Revised to 5 stars.Looks like a cool app. Loaded, but doesnt open. Uninstalled, reloaded, same results. Samsung Galaxy S 2 Touch.I will revise once it works.Dave
__label__1 I downloaded this for a fun diversion, but I found myself leaving it up.  It's nice having a &quot;live&quot; wallpaper that doesn't drink your battery.  No cons to report while using this app with my Samsung Galaxy S II.
__label__1 This is a pretty neat live wallpaper/battery monitor. It does exactly what it appears it does... as your battery life diminishes, the Android dude melts into a puddle. You can adjust the background colors (the top color, and the bottom color to which it 
__label__0 I installed this app and used it no problem. Then about an hour later I started getting these rampant notifications that were nothing more than spam. Mostly on how I am the winner of IPads, gift cards, etc. uninstalled and the notifications stopped. I ho
__label__1 I love this live wallpaper. I wish the image was better quality and I wish there was an animation when charging but I still think its an awesome idea.
__label__1 i love the idea of having melring android depending on battery and i love the android avatar guy but i thought the wallpaper would be cuter or not so boring, maybe more colors or something! pther than that its cool &amp;its really in sync with the batter
__label__0 it seemed like a nice app but once i used it, i realized that it wasn't fine tuned and deleted it shortly after. they need to work on it a little more for people to download it
__label__1 Informative, &quot;cute&quot; and a great way to show your android pride. Didn't kill my battery. Was a constant source of entertainment all day long. Everyone I showed cracked a smile. Give it a try, really, you just might enjoy it.
__label__1 Thia is a great wallpaper.  The addition of the percentage was a nice touch. And You can change the size of andy in the settings.  Big or small...
__label__1 so cute,  that stupid little android melting away instead of looking for a power source to recharge its batteries kaboom
__label__1 this is a great addition to my minamilist home screen,  I was able to ditch my battery meters,  and now just have beautiful widgets home.  works excellent on a rooted of droid.
__label__1 The &quot;Drains Battery&quot; review made me laugh--brilliantly put. It's a joke guys, think before you respond...&quot;at around 100% the normal rate&quot; = NO CHANGE. And &quot;a couple hours later, it was down to 95%&quot; I only wish my phone only 
__label__1 I like it, it's a cool background and does exactly what it says it does.  The only reason I don't really use it is that it's sort of a boring background.  Although, what I find boring someone else may find sleek so I won't down-rate based on a style base
__label__1 This has been a great wall paper to use, with an easy way to see where your battery is without killing it
__label__1 Neat idea. Looks nice, not with crazy, jumbled designs , no scroll, which I love, and free. Definitely worth the download!
__label__1 This is a fun wall paper.  The% at the bottom is also prety cool.  I also think I am getting better battery life.
__label__1 11-25:can now move back to sd card! only takes up couple hundred kb on card.  ;)  i love the settings that let you customize background colors and robot size.  well done!PRIOR REVIEW: ... I did really like this wallpaper but made mistake of installing up
__label__1 Just got this app today and I can't tell if it hurts battery life or not but I can't imagine that it would. It just changes the picture with the battery level to the next picture in the progression (much better than other live walk papers). Overall I lik
__label__1 This app does what it says. I set it as my live wallpaper for my Incredible 2 and is a fun way to maintain visual cues for your battery life. Update now adds a percentage of life left. Everything is in the background so it doesn't interfere with my apps/
__label__1 love this wallpaper. functional and cute and it doesn't kill my battery. I'm usually hesitant to download live wallpapers but this app is worth it.
__label__0 it is VERY low resolution.  all live walls are battery drains too.  maybe if i could customize colors and it was HD... i could use itnice IDEA tho
__label__1 This is a clean simple application that shows the battery charge status. Minimal battery consumption for a live wallpaper. I actually find myself trying to waste my battery just so that I can see the cute Droid melt.
__label__1 this is great. the android logo is cute enough as it is, but when you add it mealting in an adoable little puddle as your battery depletes, makes it even cuter.cant believe its free
__label__1 Graphics look very sharp and it functions on my HTC Incredible 2 without any issues. Also seems to use far less resources than other live wallpapers.
__label__1 so cute and I love him. what is there more to say? do you want my five star rating or not?
__label__1 Not mucb to say.  Works as intended and is easy on battery life for a live wallpaper. It makes my daughter sad when the battery is low.
__label__1 The updated graphics are much better. Cool to be able to change background color. Like the added percent readout, though it is somewhat small and gets a bit lost in my homescreen icon. Thanks for listening dev and adding in requests/suggestions so quickl
__label__1 Doesn&apos;t destroy battery life because it remains still till battery level depletes, but still provides a new appearance each time your phone is checked.
__label__1 Would like to see the ability to change colors but otherwise pretty cool! The little Droid dude is cute, but I agree that the eyes should glow only when charging.
__label__1 This app works just perfect. Very nice for a free app. Does not use any additional battery. Would be nice if the eyes glowed bright when charging. Droid2Global.
__label__1 Shows me in a neat way how much juice I've got left. Does what it says it does and that all that matters
__label__1 I love this background the moment I got it. It is unbelievably simplistic but aethetical and Useful! This background beats all the other backgrounds out there and it's free! I am more than willing to pay a buck for such a pleasing background.So what this
__label__1 needs a better landscape mode and it also needs an indicator by the android of how much battery life is left too. also needs to be more customizable like change background/color/how much battery life is left etc. other than that this is an awesome wallpa
__label__0 it ducks like totem eggs horrible controls horrible graphics horrible objectives horrible! IM WARNING YOU DONT PLAY IT. YOU WILL HATE IT
__label__1 Fun,  frustrating, and addictive! Easy to get started, challenging as you go,  and hard to guess how much time has passed as you play,  absorbing!
__label__0 This is the worst app i have played in a very long time!!!!  the visual is ok, but the game itself is boring, repetitive and tedious!
__label__1 THIS WASN'T FOR  ME  BUT  FOR  MY GRANDBOYS,THEY HAD A BLAST WITH IT.SO FOR CHRISTMAS THEY  GOT A 7 INCH TABLET NOW  THEY CAN PLAYWITH OWN
__label__1 Looking for an exciting game with rich graphics and a compelling story?  Than look no further!  Dante: The Inferno, brought to you by the hard-working development team of Another Good Time is just the game for you!  I love this game, and highly recommend
__label__0 The game presents itself as a clean, well-made puzzle/adventure through The Inferno.  Instead you get alot of bland graphics and a game that bores after the first few screens.  Don't be fooled by the description and pictures, this game is not very good.
__label__0 This *game* wants my phone # and info, network info, wifi info, and then open network sockets. What the...?!  Too bad because this game actually looks interesting.
__label__1 I hope Amazon updates the product listing to indicate that this single player game contains NO extra permissions! Did the developer fix it at the last minute? I don't know, but at least he or she did the right thing!
__label__1 Graphics are okay, but the gameplay is great! You've got to act pretty quick on your feet in order to survive, as well as use your head. Well worth a dollar as you can spend a decent amount of time on this and not get bored. The levels are challenging at
__label__1 I have added a photo of the Kindle Fire permissions page and as you can see no permissions are listed or activated.Game play:You have to collect all of the souls in the level to open the gate and exit. As soon as you collect the souls you have to move qu
__label__0 This game looks and sounds great. The game mechanics are great. The story is great.The controls are indescribably bad.If the control-cross was resizable and a touch less sensitive this would be a 5 star app.............as it is its 1 star crap.Its too ba
__label__1 this app is GREAT, very entertaining platform game. a great way to pass the time when your are board. there was one level with a minor graphics glitches but nothing big
__label__0 The game seemed like it would be fun. I played multiple levels but the more difficult the levels got the more frustrating the controls became.  Consequently, I uninstalled the app.  The graphics were decent and concept was ok but the controls ruined it f
__label__1 I played all the way through this one from the android market.  It had ads which why there might be the diff between free and paid.It turned out too be a really good game.  It starts easy and ramps up the difficulty as the game progresses, just like it s
__label__1 so I read a few of the review and decided to try the game, I played 8 levels before writing this review.the game didn't ask for no additional permissions , do that's a plus.there's is directional up down left and right .. kinda old school but it worked f
__label__0 until developers can justify these permissions with logical explanations to &quot;us&quot; end users I'm not going to give them my money even if its a faotd
__label__1 great game lots of fun i recommend it to anyone who likes puzzle gamez five stars out of five stars
__label__1 Dante's Inferno has a good core mechanic that is a pleasure to see used in such creative levels. The gameplay is smooth and the pace great for picking up and chipping away at a level or two. definately want to see how further levels progress. classic gra
__label__0 did not enjoy it. It is a puzzle game that depends on how fast you can move to avoid monsters and traps. It got boring real quick.
__label__1 To start with, I have to point out that this is not my type of game, so I have uninstalled it after a few maps.But I wanted to give some positive scores, because I see a lot of attention that went into this game.Yes, the controls are a bit itchy, but I t
__label__0 I did not get it.  I found it very boring.  Did not hold my attention.  Playing on Kindle Fire. Maybe it would be better on another device
__label__0 I downloaded the app and it began to install and could not install.  I attempted to install several times without success.  If anyone has any ideas let me know.  I would be glad to reassess the app if I can get it to install.
__label__1 OMG this game is so cute I'm 12 and I think its amazing totally I love it love it please get I so think you should
__label__0 I thought this was a game not somthing to tell u to do cetain things at certain time. that certain thing is something not for a 12 year old.
__label__1 I got it for my 3 year old daughter her name is Chloe and she loves it as long as she love it then I'm ok with that she able to take care of the baby. so people who gave it I hate it.  then what the hell is wrong with you ok get it
__label__0 nothing to do you just sit there and set timers and alarms for stuff to do. and there os somethings on there I would not want a 2 or 3 year old to see!! and pictures!!!!
__label__1 for all the people who say its boring this is not a game. This is to help with child care. So don't hate you haters. and again its not a game.
__label__1 I had an infant in the NICU for 3.5months. This app can be set to remind you to pump (which is what I used it for) as well as other cares for the baby such as meds. I will continue to use it when the baby comes home.
__label__1 its super cute and its like a real baby! she cries when shes hungry and stuffs.i totally recommend you guys getting this app!!!!!:) Have a Merry Christmas:)!
__label__1 I love it. I use it everyday and it has everything I could need. I use it for my toddler too.
__label__0 I hate this app and u should never get it. it makes like totally no sense and I uninstalled it immediately.
__label__0 For one: I thought u could make yewr own baby and stuff. For 2: Its just a schedule! I do NOT reccomrnd this app!
__label__1 I have really liked this app and its features. It helps a sleep deprived new mom stay organized. I would recommend it to anyone. Best part is its free!
__label__0 if y'all think that this is a game... its not!!  if you would go back to the description,  it says that it keeps track of sleep,  eating etc... DO NOT GET IF YOU DONT HAVE AN INFANT TO CARE FOR!!
__label__1 Sooo friggin useful; especially for a free app. It has many useful features. It makes keeping track of baby's habits much easier. I use it to help me remember which side I nursed on and to keep track of how often she eats.
__label__1 For being a first time mom this app sure does help out and remind on feeding times, diaper changes, and the other things needed to do :)
__label__1 I just love this app it keeps up with everything. no more forgetting what time baby ate or how much how often or how many it keeps up with it all.
__label__1 This app was a great tool to use when my daughter was first born. We used it to keep track of feedings, diaper changes, and her doctor appointment stats. We still use it to track her height/weight and love this app!
__label__0 two words man two words: don't getit doesn't make any sense and the first time i saw it i fought it was cute but now its (fart) bad!!!
__label__1 This game is for people that are going to start a family and I am I put this game because I was growing a family with my twins  and this made me think I am going to be a great father and I was very excited to see my twin girls there 8 months now I can't 
__label__0 wish it did a little more than it does, looks like i will go back to using color notes instead.
__label__0 This app looks so cool when I founded, then after installing it in my fire, look so dull and boring. Maybe needs an update. The menu options do not have preferences, so you can't customize the look. Too bad!!!

__label__1 I like jigsaw puzzles, so I thought I'd try this game and I am so happy I did. I only play huge (48 pieces) and hard (no edges highlighted) as I enjoy the challenge, but others may like that there are easier options. And expansion packs of more images ar
__label__1 I think I somehow got this app for free once, but I would definitely pay for it. I've purchased the expansion pack, and it was worth it. Nice, smooth game play. Fun. And you can choose how hard you want it to be, etc. Great app overall. I can't think of 
__label__1 Like many puzzles in HOG. Varying degrees of difficulty add interests. Was FAOTD but I would definitely recommend for purchase.
__label__1 This game is great. The only thing I don't like is the music, but there's an option to mute it. For anyone who enjoys puzzles, this is for you. There's a very simple level, a medium level, and an even harder one.
__label__1 This has been a very enjoyable game. Graphics are well chosen and the options on the puzzle difficulty are very flexible.
__label__1 This is one of the most beautifully clean games I've played on my Fascinate. The colors pop and the jigsaw puzzle itself is very addicting. Challenging enough to keep you coming back, but not so challenging that you end up getting frustrated and toss it.

__label__1 Love the puzzles and how you can select the size and level of difficulty. Beautiful pictures that are very vibrant.
__label__1 All of my four children,  ages 4 to 8, love this game. Especially my 6 year old. He's always asking if he can work on the puzzles and unlock new ones for me. This is a good one for young and old alike.
__label__1 This is a fun way to do puzzles.  It is a little hard to move the pcs. but you will figure it out after doing the first puzzle  There are quite a few pretty pictures to do.
__label__1 This is a great puzzle to own.  You have various choices of level &amp; pieces.  What I like the most is that I have to solve it.  There are no hints.  Makes you burn some brain power!
__label__1 This App is so worth the price.  Now I got mine on the Free App of the day however, I wouldn't mind paying for it.  This App is endless...by that I mean, you can use your own pictures to create a puzzle.  The App keeps track of your completion time and n

__label__1 This is a very simple puzzle pieces game, but it runs smoothly and is a joy to play. Varying difficulty options as well as many picture choices (including your own) keep things from getting stale. Highly recommend.
__label__1 Got this as Free App of the Day. I don&apos;t like jigsaw puzzles but I love this app. Great photos and  endless ways to customize. I even used one of my own photos to make a puzzle. I&apos;d buy it, it&apos;s a great time killer. Love those free apps, w

__label__1 If you love puzzles you will love this game. It gives you choices of difficult, easy, and medium  and the puzzle scenes are really nice. I'm waiting for them to do a part two of this game.

__label__1 This is one of the better puzzle games I have tried on my HTC EVO. The implementation is very good and I have played it for hours without any issues. The game basically makes mosaic pieces out of either the preloaded or your personal pictures stored on t
__label__1 I love an app that does a job well, with great presentation, and perfect functionality.  This app is one of those. IT WORKS VERY WELL!

__label__1 Works great on the Fire! Pictures are beautiful and puzzles are challenging. A puzzle game done right. Love, love, love it. Can't wait to try the expansion pack.
__label__1 The android market version was updated last week.  Why not this one?  Did you abandon the Amazon Apparently store?  Don't forget about what you wrote in the changelog over there mentioning the Amazon app stores awesome constructive criticism.
__label__1 But it is ridiculous to require 20 or more words in a comment so here you go, blah blah blah blah
__label__1 This is a fun and addictive slider puzzle game. I like the ability to choose how many pieces and the level of difficulty for each puzzle. If I just want a quick and easy time killer, I can choose the easiest levels, but the harder challenges are there, t
__label__1 I played this puzzle app on the Kindle Fire demo model in my local Target.  I came home and downloaded a couple of free puzzle apps to my own Kindle Fire, but I wasn't impressed so I paid real money for Spectrum Puzzles and I was not disappointed.  The p
__label__1 I find myself becoming very relaxed while being challenged. I like the fact that you can easily glance at the full picture when students stuck. A true brain game.
__label__1 I love doing puzzles and this app has some good ones. The pics pop right out.  the colors are very vibrant on my kindle fire hd. I love that the pieces can be rotated and are given in different positions. Others I have played has the picture in the appro
__label__0 Cool app but all the pics are unorganized. Took me hours to put them all in order. It should say &quot;some assembly required &quot; in the description!! Some ppl might not have the time to unscramble the pics.
__label__1 I haven't stopped doing puzzles since I got this. The graphics are great, there are varying levels of difficulty, and it's just all around fun.
__label__1 I downloaded this 2 hours ago and have been playing ever since. Have tried different sizes and difficulties as well as using my own images. works great, lots of fun. gotta stop playing and get something accomplished today!
__label__1 The demo version gives you a taste of the challenge ahead.  This isn't just a regular jigsaw puzzle.  It has difficulty levels.  On the medium level, the pieces can be rotated.  You no longer can use the edges to build a shell then fill in the blanks.  T
__label__1 Love playing with this app. Lots of puzzles to keep you occupied. Pictures are much better than the ones in other puzzle games I have tried.
__label__1 If you enjoy puzzles or just need a quick distraction from the chaos around you, then this app is perfect! It has varying levels of difficulty, and when you're ready for a new challenge, there are 3 other image packs available, albeit for 99 cents each. 
__label__1 I down loaded some time ago and kind of forgot about it. In the process of cleaning up I rediscovered it. Been playing every since.  Beautiful you l bright colors . Aesthetically pleasing as well as fun!
__label__1 I really like the pictures that this uses, they are really colorful and make putting together the pictures fun. I like how you can choose the level of difficulty so anybody can play this and have fun with it. It does suck a bit of battery power, but I ha
__label__1 These puzzles are both lovely and interesting. They also offer a variety of ways to play. I have the expansion pack and the spring pack, and would really enjoy MORE puzzles please.
__label__1 I thought this app was going to suck! But I thought I would download it and try it. IT IS FREAKING AWESOME! BEST PUZZLE APP EVER!!

__label__1 I have enjoyed the puzzles in this app, the size and difficulties settings allows for many different age and ability groups to use. Have used this app with children and adults. Really like it. I am buying the expansion pack.
__label__1 Love the puzzles, love the pictures, love the fact you can keep getting add ons, the only downfall is that all the puzzle pieces are squares.  However, being able to select the puzzle piece amount makes up for it.
__label__1 Beautiful and full size pictures/puzzles on my tablet (running Honeycomb 3.2).  It is intuitive and easy to play.  I didn't get this app for excitement, but rather because I enjoy puzzles.  The developer didn't put in unnecessary permissions.  To top it 
__label__1 Lots of options and ways to increase and\/or decrease the difficulty. It comes with many images, but you can use your own as well.
__label__1 I do love this app. I only wish the peaceful music also played during the puzzle. Can't install last update tho.
__label__1 Even though this game is $1.49- its worth the price. Spectrum Puzzles is a jigsaw puzzle. They give you tons of pictures to do. You have a choice after you pick your picture-small (12 pieces), averge (20 pieces), large (30 pieces), and last but not least
__label__1 Author has addressed issues with early release and this is now a fun, solid app.  I certainly do enjoy playing.
__label__1 Fun app with enough variety to keep me entertained. Contrary to other reviews, this installs and works just fine on my Droidx.
__label__1 very simple to use and a great app for kids.  My son is enthralled with it and the variety of difficulty levels leave room for him to grow.
__label__1 The idea of using a custom picture for a puzzle has been around for a while, but never executed well. This dev carries it through very well in this app and even adds new features in the mix. Highly recommend.
__label__1 If you enjoy puzzle, this is truly a fun set.  I love the different levels and the pics are pretty
__label__1 Been playing it now for about 2 hours, this would be worth paying for.  Really addicting. Making the review a minimum of 25 words is stupid.  As Mark Twain said, why should I use officer, when I get paid the same for cop.
__label__1 The puzzles are colorful and the subjects are fun.  Since downloading a few days ago, I have already done many puzzles.
__label__0 If I want a puzzle game like this there are hundreds on the market already for FREE so why would anyone pay $1.60??? Come on Amazon wake up!!! This is nothing new nor fun. I&apos;LL PASS!!
__label__1 Definitely would recommend this game. Great while listening to podcasts. Lots of options and the ability to make custom puzzles from your own pics.
__label__1 This is a fun and easy to use app that I've been running on my Droid Incredible without problems.Pictures are provided and start easy, move up to difficult and are played using a small number of pieces or a large number of pieces (all pieces are squares)
__label__1 Here's the caveat...you get this one and then you get hooked on the puzzles so you HAVE TO get the additions.  They aren't expensive so I ended up with all of them.  I wish they made more.  You can choose how many pieces and the difficulty level.  It has
__label__1 This is a fun app. The puzzles were cool and a range of skill levels. I had fun playing this app. You should try it.
__label__1 Wish it was free, but that's okay, I got it on free app day. The game is good and the puzzles are hard. Just wish the images were harder
__label__1 got this app several days ago and love that i get to choose how difficult or how eady i want my puzzle to be.  and the pictures are beautiful.
__label__1 I love being able to use my own images. Sweet little app that I keep coming back to play.  Easy to use.
__label__1 There are times when you want to have a brain break.  This app is perfect for that. I love that you can choose the number of pieces along with the level of difficultly.

__label__1 love it!!!!!!!!! lots of puzzles,really liked making my own!!  the Colors are really bright and clear. hope to see other puzzle apps****
__label__1 I love this app. Beautifully colored puzzles. Each puzzle has 4 different puzzle sizes, amount of pieces, to choose from along with 3 different difficulty settings. So the same puzzle has several variations to it. Can easily be set up for your kids and t
__label__1 Although most people will say I (or anyone who gives a good rating) is the developer, I&apos;m not. Just wanted to say I love puzzles and this does what it is supposed to do. It&apos;s fun, runs great, great graphics, does what it says. It&apos;s nice ge
__label__1 I hate puzzles...the little cardboard jigsaws my entire family obsesses over for days puzzles... But I love this app! I finally figured out why people like puzzles. The pictures in this app are interesting with vibrant colors, the music is just lovely, a
__label__1 Neat selection of pictures, definitely varied levels of difficulty. Gameplay is straightforward, but interesting enough for at least some replay to get faster scores.
__label__1 ok...some have rated this puzzle a 1 star for reason of bugs. I'm using the Fire and the puzzle does closes down many times (and it does iritate me sometimes lol), but I still would give it 5 stars (even ten if I could). This has been the greatest jigsaw
__label__1 I don&apos;t like picture puzzles in the real world, so I wasn&apos;t even seriously considering this application. However, since it was free, I installed it. Believe it or not, I actually enjoy working these puzzles. For that reason, I have to give this
__label__1 I really like this app - especially that you can use your own images. That aspect really expands the options.

__label__1 Really like this puzzle game its fun and enjoyed it very much.  Do recommend to others. Easy to use and fun for all ages.
__label__1 My first spectrum puzzle, and I love it.  The puzzles and all of the different available levels of difficulty are fantastic.  I haven't even counted the number of puzzles, let alone how many variations.
__label__1 I love puzzles so really enjoyed this app. Wish there were more puzzles in the free version. Ended up getting another puzzle app (very inexpensively) because I found this so enjoyable for short bursts of time to kill.
__label__1 Very generous number of puzzles are included along with three levels of difficulty.  If you get stuck on a puzzle you can select to make it one level easier without loosing your place.  They also have an expansion pack with  even more puzzles.  I can't p
__label__1 Well designed, easy to use interface with beautiful &amp; colorful photos. I&apos;m not much into puzzles but thought I&apos;d try it as it was FAotD today and was pleasantly surprised! \nIf you like puzzles I&apos;m sure you&apos;ll love this!\nWell don
__label__1 Great game works well on every level. people complaining now on the fact that there&apos;s no permissions, if there was they&apos;d have slammed it but come on really no permissions! You people are way too paranoid.\n
__label__1 Great for the whole family! I appreciate the fact that there are more puzzle pictures released now and then. My daughter enjoys how easy the game is to use. We also like that we can select how easy or difficult the puzzle is.
__label__1 Very good game, well worth the price.  Simple concept, but very well executed, and way above par for Android apps.  Works flawlessly on DX and wife&apos;s Tbolt.
__label__1 This is an app for the puzzler. I am hooked. Great oportunity to modulate difficulty, with great  tableau. Have to be thoughtful when i start as I will not want to stop soon

__label__1 This is a real good puzzle game if you like puzzles. You can play this for hours without realizing it.

__label__1 First jigsaw puzzle I have tried and glad I did.  Addictive and fun.Looking forward to trying different options offered.
__label__1 No problems so far. I have played small and large puzzles with edges showing. Good variety of images. Wish the puzzle pieces were jigsaw, not square. Other than that, no complaints.
__label__1 This game requires no permissions! I installed it right away because the game looked appealing, and it was. The gameplay is very simple, as it explains everything right from the beginning, that&apos;s how it&apos;s supposed to be done, take note, to all 
__label__1 Not a typical jigsaw puzzle, more of rearrange/properly arrange squares.  All the same it's fun and works very well.  Lots of options for increasing difficulty.  A very nice app.
__label__1 Spectrum is great fun. The puzzle variety keeps it interesting and you can choose your difficulty level for each one. You can even change the difficulty while you are solving the puzzle! Looooooove it! Spectrum has options to buy additional puzzle packs 
__label__1 This is good to keep my brain active and sharp.  It is just challenging enough so that I am  not bored.
__label__1 Fun game that is very simple and easy to play, but really fun and challenging. One of the best free apps offered. Works perfect on Epic 4g
__label__1 I really enjoy this game/app. I love doing jigsaw puzzles but really good physical ones are expensive and take up a lot of space. Also, I have pets so there is really no place to keep a puzzle safe while you complete it.These video puzzles are a great so
__label__1 I play on kindle fire h.d. works great no problems . Beautiful pictures, multiple game play. If you love puzzles this is a must play app. You move the blocks around to complete the puzzles. Enjoy the game everyone. =^**^=
__label__1 East to use UI; beautiful, colorful pictures. LOVE the ability to enter in your own photos from your camera. Lots of different levels for each picture so it will take you awhile before you get bored of this. I would&apos;ve paid for it.
__label__1 I stayed up late and started playing Spectrum Puzzles. Now I can&apos;t stop! It is soooo addicting. Worth $1.60? Easy answer: yes!
__label__1 I love puzzles of any kind,but this one is a little different which was a pleasant surprise, can't wait to put more puzzle together....
__label__1 If you're a traditional puzzle fan, Spectrum Puzzles is the ideal app. Not only does it present a number of puzzles, it gives you multiple ways to work them; 12-48 pcs. Sometimes pieces may be difficult to recognize, but the game lets you know when you h
__label__1 First of all, I am a huge fan of puzzles and this was definitely a pleasant surprise to see as the free app of the day in the Amazon app market.  I downloaded this app thinking it was going to be limited to just a few stock images and not that fun, but w

__label__1 The game is actually very fun. It definitely has the &quot;just one more&quot; effect on you. Next thing you know you&apos;ve blown through an hour just rearranging puzzle pieces. Nice clean UI, none of the usual permissions that will scare the conspirac

__label__1 Picking your bonus round is a real hoot. Game is a lotsa fun. Works fine on Kindle HD.I can play for hours and not lose a real dime. Highly recommend this game!
__label__1 This is a wonderful graphic game very realistic play.  We go to the casino boats once a month and this game has proven you can play and not pay (out of your pocket).  Was worth the money.  Works well on my Kindle Fire HD 8.9, have fun!

__label__1 Boost Mobile CDMA allows unlimited data with no-contract at $15/mo. T-Mobile also has a GSM plan that's $30/mo with unlimited data and 100 voice minutes. Exceed those minutes with this app! My friend uses this on Boost CDMA with no issues! I can always r
__label__1 If you have a phone or tablet with no activated account, this is a great way to use it as a phone. It sets up easily with your (free!) Google Voice account, and works over 3G/4G or wireless. Amazon has a great price for it, saved me $3.00. Voice quality

__label__1 I don't know where else to ask this, but i thought i was already making VOIP calls with Google Voice, no third party required? I mean, i'm sitting here with (apparently) no T-Mo signal but connected to the LAN. When i place a call a dialog asks me if i w
__label__1 Been making calls from Sydney.. Beijing... Tokyo, and many other places. Drops calls every now and then, but overall, works very well. Beats the pants off of Skype.
__label__1 This app is incredible! I can make calls with myLG Optimus Prepaid Android Phone (Virgin Mobile)and not use any minutes. Well worth the $3.99.
__label__0 I have droid bionic.  Go to the Google voice app.  Click on setting and choose &quot;ask each time I make call&quot;  Then go to your contact list and hit the green phone button.  It will them give you the option to call with or without google voice.  Th
__label__1 A great VOIP application utilizing Google Voice.  No need to confiure a SIP account,  one checkbox to check on Google Voice settings page and you're up and running for both incoming and outgoing calls.  Voice quality is above average and the price is rig
__label__0 You can get the same thing by just using google voice. This is just some developer trying to make a few bucks off of people who don't know any better.
__label__0 I'm not getting any sound on either side with this app. If I do get any sound it's usually just a loud buzzing sound. It frequently stays stuck on the calling page and doesn't actually accomplish an outgoing call connection. And it only receives one inco
__label__1 What a great app. Easy to use, very reliable and works consistently. I use this app a lot to help not to go over my minutes. #verizon #droidbionic
__label__0 It works for outgoing calls but not really,  I might be able to talk for a few minutes and then the audio stops completely and even if I try to call again there is not sound. So I pretty much have to restart the phone if I want to call again.  Incoming c

__label__1 I was skeptical at first since Skype and all these &quot;free&quot; services require money if you read the fine print.  I have an HTC EVO View tablet.  it is like a phone but not.  I am also new to android but I was so tired of apple.  Google voice doesn
__label__1 I tried this app before from the Android Market place on my VM Samsung Intercept. Total no go.I then had a chance to get a $2.00 credit for the Amazon Android Marketplace, and they had GrooVe IP on sale for $1.99. Snapped it up.Recently was able to upgra
__label__1 Using cm7 on my Evo, this works perfectly. I'm on vacation and the place I'm staying at has spotty coverage. Using the wifi that's available and putting the phone in airplane mode is saving me big on battery drain.  Obviously helps that I still get my sm
__label__1 I love jigsaw puzzles and this free app definately made me want to purchase the other two Apps provided by Spectrum Puzzles. The puzzels have wonderful pictures to choose from, including the size of puzzle you would like to complete. If you have your tim
__label__1 This is my second favorite game on my Kindle Fire (behind Plants vs Zombies). The mechanics are seamless and delightful - tap to rotate, tap two pieces to swap places. The pictures are gorgeous, and with the expansion pack kept me avidly playing for days
__label__1 This is a great app, especially to be free!  I love to work jigsaw puzzles, but they are always in the way or pieces fall in the floor.  With this app, you don't have to worry about any of that.  The puzzles have different settings, so you can change the
__label__1 I tried the free version and immediately downloaded the paid version (which is a great price for the amount of puzzles) once I finished the puzzles. It's great to be able to choose difficulty level. It's a challenge, but not impossible - perfect!
__label__1 There are 10 puzzles.  There are 4 playing options:  12, 20, 30 and 48 pcs which is like playing each one 4 times.  The BUT part is you have to purchase the other puzzles offered if you want to have more puzzles.
__label__0 Freezes while you are working on it shuts down the kindle, wish the developer would fix these things as they've been told about it many times.
__label__0 It was awful. I would never want to play this again. It too easy to play I wish it have more choice.
__label__1 I LIKED THIS PUZZLE SO MUCH AND GOT SO INTRIGUED BY IT THAT I DECIDED TO PURCHASE THE FULL VERSION. I WAS NOT DISAPPOINTED.
__label__1 This game looks great on a Kindle Fire or even a 4in Sprint EVO.  The puzzles are beautiful and range from moderately easy to challenging.  The free demo includes six puzzles -- just enough to whet your appetite.  The full version has 47 puzzles.  There 
__label__0 It only lets you play six pitcher puzzles then if you want to play more you have to by the non free virson so I woulb not get this stiled game.
__label__1 This is such a great app, I love the pictures and this keeps me  entertained .graphics are good and I like the content of the pictures.
__label__1 This puzzle is very entertaining, shared it with my sister and she loved it too. All ages, all levels and if you buy the upgrade you can do your own pictures.
__label__1 This is a great app. I have the full version & even bought the expansion pack. You can go back and do the puzzles at different difficulty levels and it also lets you use your own photos or pictures so it's really unlimited in the number of puzzles you ca
__label__1 I downloaded these for my son..and now I'm hooked..I really like the graphics in each picture and then there's the puzzle piece amount..I have down loaded my next three puzzles already..They have a challenge to them and I like that...keep them coming.
__label__1 The calculator is so easy to use. It provides the amount of fabric to purchase for various aspects of quilting in matter of seconds and eases my concerns of buying enough fabric.
__label__1 I'm making two quilts and I needed to figure the material for the backs. This was quick and easy. Love it!
__label__1 My wife, who is an avid quilter saw this program at a get-together and says this is fast calculating, and a great service for non-computer users and very easy to understand.
__label__1 Great quilting tool since this is what I do.  Have not used it yet but I am sure I will soon
__label__1 I love the QuiltCalc.  I own a quilt shop and it makes things easier and faster.  Don't have to try to think on days when we are busy.Glad I could download it on my Kindle Fire.
__label__1 This is a fantastic app and a GREAT and handy quilting tool. I love Robert Kaufmann fabrics and this app provides another reason to love this company! Thanks RK!
__label__1 I love the options, particularly the calcs for setting triangles, my personal measurement nightmare! Well-thought out. Love that ad pops at the start then doesn't show in calc. Love description of how to use each calc. Great app, RK!
__label__1 I work in a quilt shop and this is very handy to use to get the information you need. You would be surprised how many customers come in for us to figure out what they need; but that is what we are there for.
__label__1 Got this to test it out to recommend to my quilting customers.  Love it.  It's so easy to figure out what you need in fabric for a project.
__label__1 The QuiltCalc App is an excellent easy peasy tool for quilters, whether it be for just beginners or pros. Great app to have for all quilters at your very fingertips.
__label__1 I've only looked through it and checked out a couple of calculations, but this could really save me time and frustration. And it was FREE!!!
__label__1 This is sooo convenient to have with me at all times. Wonderful little tool if you're a quilter. I especially like the piece count option. You can specify any size piece you're cutting. The other calculator only allowed for squares or triangles, but not 
__label__1 I got this app because I have a hard time figuring out how much backing fabric I need. Usually have to make another trip to the store but with this app I haven't had too. Very helpfull app.
__label__1 Quilters calculated is sew handy on my Kindle fire HD.As a quilter,it takes alot of the guess work out of how much fabric you need for all your quilting projects.And this would be an awesome app for any of your quilting friends.
__label__1 This is a fun, old school dungeon Crawler with excellent graphics.  Very addictive!  This is anexcellent example of a mobile app that hits the sweet spot of easy to learn with a good amount of depth.  My only gripe:  I wish it was easier to organize your
__label__0 I am not necessarily a fan of this type of game, but I tried it only because it was offered free. Slow, cumbersome and no directions. It is not fun when you are guessing what to do. Got bored real quick.
__label__1 If you liked Wizardry or Might and Magic, you'll love this game. This was a great trip down memory lane.
__label__0 Like I said for the title why is in the TOP FREE if its not free? I almost bought a app that I would later forget about and delete. It said Free people but its not free. It looks fun I wish I could have gotten it but why buy something you know later your
__label__0 I usually like these games, but this one was really boring! Same thing over and over and over. One problem is having to go back several levels to get more keys. YUCK!
__label__1 My ONE complaint: Ow, my aching thumbs/fingers!There are a miscellany of minor &#34;get used to it&#34; hics and ups but over all, if you ever loved the classic &#34;Dungeon Crawl&#34;, you'll love it. The mobs don't respawn (a single tear rolls down my 
__label__0 I bought this for my daughter and son my daughter is 8 and my son is 9 but they thought it was boring so I tried it but it was boring to me. BTW when I got off the game the music keep playing so I removed this game don't waste ur 99 cent if it does that.
__label__0 After reading the reviews I really wanted to try this game.  After downloading my s4 scanned it and it said test security access.  I instantly Uninstalled this app.  Why would they need to test device security?
__label__0 This is the worst game I have ever downloaded.The controls on this game are awful.The game play is boring and repedative and pointless.I uninstalled after 10 min.of play I could not stand one more min.Do NOT WAST YOUR TIME TO DOWNLOAD!!!! The only good r

__label__1 Decent graphics and sound, a tad to easy to get lost, love all the goodies available. For free it's worth twice the price!!
__label__1 Played this as a demo a while back...liked it then -like it now i got full version.. graphics remind me of early  nintendo games i loved
__label__0 I kept dying so i just stopped minutes in. It was free and i deleted it from my phone within 15 minutes...
__label__1 Deadly Dungeons takes you back to the days of Ultima Underworld and Eye of the Beholder and does so in a very good way. It's a pure first-person POB dungeon crawl with decent graphics, intuitive controls and good level and monster design. I have only one
__label__1 Wow, just finished the whole game. It was a classic dungeon crawl and looks a lot like the similar games from many years back. It does have the somewhat repetitive nature of these games, but if you play through 2 to 4 levels, you get a new kind of dungeo
__label__1 This game definitely calls to mind a few of the old school dungeon crawlers that I played way back in the day. It's  pretty fun with decent replay value. :)
__label__1 A little difficult to maneuver at first, but once you get the hang of it, it's fun. Great for a stop-and-start day, and even for a couple hours.
__label__1 I find this to a very compelling RPG. The story is not particularly deep, but it is deep enough to make sense of the bosses at the end of each section. There are no puzzles and most of it is very straightforward. If you like clearing out levels of monste
__label__1 I got this as faotd and didn't open it till later when the dog needed to go out at 3am.  while I waited I started up this game.... the sun had come up when I stopped for a break. lol. let me just say that sometimes simple is better.  I have subs in big m
__label__1 This is not my type of game, took it as the free app of the day, just to try it.  But my Grandson loves this game. He says great graphics, and I believe he said 3-D and it seems to be right up a gamers alley.
__label__1 I didn't expect thus game to be this good. The only thing I would add is an option to delete characters. Great game, worth the money.
__label__1 nice well thought out dungeon crawler the  permissions it request make sense as well witch is always a plus not having stupidly outlandish permissions.
__label__1 This game is like a classic FPS dungeon crawler you just haven't played before. The mechanics are rather simple, which only add to the addictive gameplay. There is a tremendous amount of customization to allow you to build the type of character you want,
__label__1 This has become my new favorite tablet game.  It lets you advance as a character, gear up, not too crazy of a grind.  I have been playing RPG's sine Bard's Tale on the Commodore 64, and they are by far my favorite style of games.  This is very reminiscen
__label__1 BEST GAME EVER! It's like the monsters walk up to you and you have to kill them? Well haave fun!With the game of course!

__label__1 Did you play PC games from the time Atari 2600 was on store shelves till Playstation 2 was released? If you were like me you avoided all the consoles in between that time because they never had good dungeon crawlers or DnD-type RPGs. Deadly Dungeons is a
__label__1 I am hooked can't put it down because there is always another monster to kill. keeps me in suspense on what is through the next door.  worth buying for sure!
__label__1 awesome and fun.  I will not uninstall this, and I uninstall a lot of things I end up not liking.
__label__1 I grew up playing a multitude of D&amp;D style RPGs in the late 80's and 90's on the PC, and this was a welcome return to those days. The graphics are decent, and it can get a bit repetitive at times, but man is it hard to put down!There are some very ni

__label__1 If you're looking for a good time wasting RPG then this game is perfect for you! I have only had this game a couple days but I have multiple characters already. I like how each new characters starts out like a blank slate and you get to choose exactly ho
__label__1 I got it last night and turned it on to try.  I couldn't put it down. It was 2am before I could tear myself away. Deadly dungeons is addicting!  Lots to choose. No in app purchases. No adds. No must give a review to play. A complete old school dungeons a
__label__1 I found this game to be totally absorbing. This game plays very well and to date this has got to be my favorite
__label__1 I grew up playing first-person 3D dungeon crawlers back on the Apple ][e, Commodore 64, and the venerable IBM 8088 when shareware games came of 5" floppies in magazines.  Back then, consoles were in their infancy and NES was nearly a decade away.  If you
__label__1 This game is really great. It reminds me of all my old favorite RPGS on the NES and SNES, only better! Many improvements were made to that old engine and layout, such a surprisingly epic music score and the ability to look around yourself outside of turn
__label__0 I appreciate someone or a team of people wrote this, but I can't get past the lack of control, the world of 90 degree movement is not fun. Galaxy SII
__label__1 Okay, so I had found this game a while ago and I immediately wanted. However, I didn't want to pay for it right then and there, so I added it to my saved for later list.Lo and behold, I am glad that I waited! I love the FAOTD part of the app store.Though
__label__1 This is like the original &quot;Eye of the Beholder&quot; type RPG. You pick a charactervand start playing.  A couple of hints...use a bow...concentrate on building up on type of magic spellband save often.
__label__1 I have been super hooked on this game...it is so reminiscent of the old might n magic games I played growing up...I love it!! I wish there were more Apps like this one! it loads quick, u can save multiple characters...tons of items ...I love it!
__label__1 I've played them all, all the way back to Wizardry 1 on an Apple ][ and Alkabeth. I've solved every Infocom text adventure. I solved the cassette release of Empire of the Overmind (I still have it too, in the box!) and every Scott Adams adventure ever ma
__label__1 This game has been on the top of my list for awhile now and I finally decided for a dollar what the heck. Turns out the pictures do not do the graphics justice at all. This game is actually pretty awesome for. The retro style makes this game what it is a
__label__1 Great graphics and it moves as fluid as water, although it's also pretty hard to get started. Definitely one of the better dungeon crawlers
__label__1 Ai love this, but you should be older than 12 to read in my opinion. l. I love the storiee
__label__1 ok everyone is like it has bad spelling or inappropriate stories well it doesn't im11 and even I thought the stories were pretty hilarious so back off hatersr
__label__1 it was really funny, but after like 60 stories (doesnt sound like a lot, but if you read 2 a day it only goes for a month) it just goes back to the beginning
__label__1 i love this app. i was cracking up and i still freaking laugh. its so funny. i wish there was a part where we can share our stories n submit them becuz i so wud. awsum app n evry1 who thinks its innappropriate...stop complainin n just dnt read it.
__label__0 I started to read it .  It. was horrible. I deleted it like 5 minutes later. It is not appropriate for kids. I would only recommend this app for adults. It shows bad pictures too.
__label__1 the sex stories are great.  for the people who say its bad it is really not bad. I like it
__label__1 to all thoose it is not suppose to be funny it is to make u chuckle but not to lyho (laugh your head off)  colon give it a break gosh
__label__0 Worst app ever! It did not make me laugh once, I deleted it right away. This app is not even worth downloading, seriously. Don't waste your time this app sucks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
__label__1 this is an awesome game but dont get it if u cant read it is just awsome it gets u in the mood
__label__1 I tree with awesome.....I'm 11 and I think this app is so funnnny!! Some are weird but the rest are just plain old funny.....I would recommend this to anyone who likes to laugh!!!!
__label__0 I really did love this app until they updated it and now it won't even load enough to do anything it just force closes it.They need to work out this bug fast .
__label__1 This is a great app to have to make you laugh , you should really get it some stories are inappropriate but great and funny this app is awsome.
__label__0 well ive just read the reveves and i don't want to download good luck getting any people to down load DONT WASTE YOUR TIME!

__label__0 This game is the worst a slot machine game could get. I don't know why we had to pay for the game in the first place. I highly recommend that you DO NOT buy this game. Overall, it is a load of rubbish. If you want a good game, go ahead and start looking 
__label__1 Great easy to play game. Perfect to share with grandma! Hopefully it will help avoid trips to the casino lol
__label__1 Yes I love Teddy Bears &amp; slots, it's the best of both worlds! The pulsating hearts are a tad freaky. As for payouts, I bet conservatively one dollar a bet and after thirty minutes I had over thirty thousand dollars. Won over thirteen thousand in a ja
__label__1 I got this game because it reminded me of a machine at the casino, of course if I 'hit' as well as I do on this game in the casino I would be a very happy camper! The bonus rounds are really fun and the game plays great on my Kindle Fire. If you want som
__label__1 I really like this game but wish it had more different bonus levels. The super bear bonus was great just wish there were more different kinds instead of just the 2 -3 bonuses.
__label__1 This is the game for slot freaks. Hours of entertainment and you can really win some &quot;fake &quot; money too.  Has not frozen up on me so far. WARNING very very addictive. Does anyone have the phone number of MegaHearts Anonymous?
__label__0 I can't see any point to a gambling app that doesn't allow you to win any money. At the very least, players should have a chance to win back what they paid for the app! This is not really a &quot;game&quot; as there is no skill involved. Might as well ha
__label__1 I am playing this on my Kindle Fire and it is working perfectly!  Winning started off slow and I raised my bet to $500 per pull and started winning like crazy.  I hit 4 or 5 major bonus games in a row and I won $6,017,940 in about one hour.  I hit 4 or 5
__label__1 ........love it........fun.......the bear is a little creepy but since I down loaded it I have been winning up to 35,000,000.00 and the bounds games aren't bad neither..........but it really should have a button to makes the winnings go a lot faster so I
__label__0 This was such a lame game. Glad it was free. The payoff is so small if you get a payoff at all. I bet $20 and I still lost all my money! Glad it was free!!
__label__0 This has got to be one of the most boring slot games ever created! The price &quot;free &quot; is too much to spend! Don't waste time downloading this. Life is too short! ;0)
__label__0 even though it is the faotd it id notbl worth it. i.t froze the screen for 7 hours and then deleted everything!!!!)
__label__1 Fun free app of the day. Graphics are great. No thinking required. Reminds me of the slots in Biloxi. Enjoy!!!
__label__0 The graphics and sounds are okay I guess, but since there is no real money involved it is a very dull game.Even the "extra" games you can play when you win like roulette and and card colour guessing game don't help it.Don't waste your time on it, even th
__label__1 this app is not even on the top 100 free apps list for kindle fire so I am not even going to get it even though it is the faotd. that's all I am going to say.
__label__1 Choice of odds payout makes for lots of action! Dream odds highly recommened. Frequent bonuses and generous play at $100 bet. Over a million in winnings so far. Great fun!
__label__1 this is a fun slots game. you have a few fun options with it. you can watch your winnijngs counted or turn it off. i like it on myself. you can play 5 or 6 reels. my fav option is the payout option.  dream is the way to go. won 24 mil jusf playing around
__label__1 I hated slot games until I was attempting to get my Mom to purchase a Kindle Fire and allowed her to downloaded this app.  It's additive! The mini games are fun. as well. I play this app while watching TV because there's no thinking.
__label__1 Had placed several smart phones on the counter of my bar and customers were really into the slots until the ATf showed up. Arrested seven patrons, me, and closed down my joint. Thanks for nothing Mega Hearts Slots. Use with care.
__label__1 lovely game! nice graphics and good sounds. I won 85k on a $20 bet with dream winnings on. refreshing game :-)
__label__1 The best part about this is that it works flawlessly on my HTC Inspire and my 10inch tablet.  no ads and no problems of any kind.  I could pass and hour a day if I had the time..  I love Mega hearts. the maker of this app did a GREAT JOB with this game. 
__label__1 I don't understand why this game isn't being rated better. My husband and I are having a blast with it.payout is great so that makes it even more fun. I haveplayed a lot of these games and they start out fun thenyou can't win enough to keep you into them
__label__1 I really enjoy playing this slot game.  It is like I am in Las Vegas without losing any real money.
__label__1 I enjoy playing this game.  It has great graphics, spins like a REAL slot machine, and is very entertaining!  Not sorry I purchased this one!
__label__0 As a recovered gambling addict, I was really disappointed to see that Amazon would taunt my uncontrollable urge, then I saw that you can win the &quot;Chocopot&quot;! I haven't addressed my eating disorder yet so I felt this was perfect! So I go for a wa
__label__1 this is a great slot game. bonus games comes often, payouts are great, too bad the casinos don't pay this way.  I recommend this to all that enjoy playing slots.
__label__0 Started playing, and CRASH! Restarted, and found the game play awkward. The quizzes look fun,  and I want to play, but it doesn&apos;t work well on my Droid 2.
__label__1 use it on the computer all the time. just wish you could challenge friends too like online. very fun though. Hopefully they add the challenge option soon.
__label__0 What a junk application. Not fun, set up is idiotic. Typing is buggy. Glad it was free. Not worth buying. Maybe after some updates...
__label__0 This might be a good app but I wouldn&apos;t know since it never opened just force closed every time I tried to use it. I appreciate Amazon free Apps but Sporcle is useless on my Droidx.
__label__1 This was the first app i bought from Android Market in March when i got my phone. I love it and use it daily. It keeps me thinking and keeps my mind working.The quizzes are timed, so you have to be quick! However, you aren't forced to answer them in orde
__label__0 I tried to download this on my kindle, and it charged me for it but wont let me install it.
__label__0 I love the Sporcle website. I play all the time and find it well-implemented, clever, and entertaining. I like it so much I paid for this, which was a mistake. This app is none of those things.Every game I've found so far requires that you type in the an
__label__0 That says it all. Just add it to anything related to this app. Example: UI...Stupid, Categories... Stupid, The Quizzes... you guessed it.
__label__1 I really like the sporcle web site, this is pretty close. It&apos;s really fun and has a lot of great quizzes. I do wish it would recognize wrong spelling. As for those complaining about not being able to type fast, that has nothing to do with the gamepl
__label__0 lately the free Apps haven&apos;t interested me but I like random trivia. so I download it, clicked to install, and all it says is &quot;not installed&quot; with no reason why. don&apos;t know if it&apos;s my phone or what but I can&apos;t rate properly 
__label__1 Works great on Droid X. Almost an infinite amount of quizzes. Definitely going to be usable for a while, and that&apos;s all I want out of an app.
__label__0 At first I thought this wasn't bad. I knew all this answers and other than problems with speed typing and errors I gave it 3 stars.  Then I got into a couple of games.  You really can't skip an answer!  What a piece of junk! Uninstall...
__label__0 I love trivia, but this is stupid. I just want trivia in categories that I recognize, not NHL captains. WTF? I love hockey, but that is too trivial. Uninstalled. Go away, sporkle.
__label__0 I only see a black screen aww boo.  I really wanted to try it.  samsung transform  thats the prob with so many slight  ver. of android hardware
__label__1 This App made it very easy to calculate car payments when car shopping. Was very useful for me eliminated all the guess work.Barbara S.
__label__1 I especially appreciated the ability to input taxes, trade-ins, etc. Pretty much covers all possible permutations of the car buying/pricing process.
__label__1 this app allows you to determine monthly payment from purchase price, expected fuel costs, and what car you could afford based on monthly payment.  light app and easy to use!!
__label__1 This app is a very handy tool  Kindle tool. I've used it several times in car dealerships to double-check their auto loan calculations.

__label__1 While this app doesn't do much more than the title indicates, it does do a very good job at calculating car loans.  Happy with it!
__label__1 This is a very useful app for car shopping.  It works well on the kindle with very good result.  Recommend.
__label__1 I've used this apps couple of times, trying to help my friends out for the interest rate or even the amount of downpayment to give the dealer. So it has been helpful at times, it is nothing that you use EVERYDAY, overstatIng when you need it you will be

__label__1 I recommend getting it if you like Japanese fashion, or just really cute or crazy outfits. It helps if you like designing clothes too. Lots of good ideas.

__label__1 Tried many and keep coming back.  Love the books and reference but taking notes in  many ways beats any other app.
__label__1 I know its free but... that voice... its so... odd... kinda robotic... lol anyway, great Bible app but as I said a more human-ish sounding voice would be nice.
__label__1 I choose this app and love it, the app is fast, the app has lots of resources and I have referred someone.
__label__1 As a student of the Bible, it is so cool having Strong Concordance's references at your fingertips, as well as other bible translations, books, commentaries. maps, and dictionaries that you can download as part of the app and have at your fingertips, too
__label__1 I've had these on my old pocket pc's and found very useful. Some nice commentary downloads from Calvin to Henry to Keil and Delitzch, Luther. A very expensive library easily downloaded for nothing. Nice maps dictionaries, books. An excellent product that
__label__1 lThe absolute best Bible app for the Kindle Fire paid or free. What really sold me is the &quot;Night Mode&quot; setting. White text on a black background makes reading off a lit screen easy on the eyes. Super slick interface. Navigation is a breeze. Jum
__label__1 I just love this app...it does just what it says. Very easy to navigate. Many versions and languages...would be great for missionaries and those who enjoy reading God's word in another language. Also is great for studying the Bible because it has Strong'
__label__0 In the preview, it showed commentary ability. This not the case. There is no way to obtain commentary on a verse or a book of the bible you are reading. You only get one version to read from. I deleted this one. Useless.

__label__1 I have a Velocity Micro Cruz & this app actually works like its supposed to .  I have several Bible translations to choose from, several commentaries, dictionaries to choose from plus various other things, maps, books, etc...  It has split screen capabil
__label__1 I understand that the difference between &#34;love it&#34; and &#34;hate it&#34; when it comes to Bible-study apps can come down to a single translation, commentary, set of maps, or function being available or not.If you have found a Bible-study app that
__label__1 Great, I was told about it an dlove it too, and have told others to get it..............I love it. Get it!
__label__1 after about a dozen attempts, this is the best overall Bible app i have tried.five stars in usefulness as a study Bible with the study helps that are available via free download. best part ... these helps are easy to access and use!ease of viewing is onl
__label__1 The Best way to study the original language. Also using Strong number's to find the english meaning. It has a variety if translations. I have the KJV.
__label__1 Works about as good as can be expected for a program designed for small screen devices. You get most of the material you would find on a Crosswire.org Bible program. It even has something that my Windows Crosswire version doesn't have, the ability to sho
__label__1 This app does does so much. I love it!the kj is linked to the Strongs concordance it has a list of commentaries to use and bible dictionaries. It has a lot of different languages and Bible translations. I do wish they had more of the latest translations

__label__0 You can't use this app without wifi access.  Bummer!  I want one I can use when away from home.  I liked this app's set up and ease of use.  I can't give it more than a 1 though.
__label__1 Great way to follow the preacher.Tap on the book of the bible.Then Tap the chapter.Very quick.We love it.
__label__1 The best Bible app for Android. A few feature requests: 1. turn off the soft-button backlights when in night mode and 2. be able to set colors to use in day and night mode. I'd love to see the RSV and NASB, but that's more a limitation of what's availabl
__label__1 This is a great offline bible.  I love it and it's very simple.
__label__1 well its okay but when i played it for my kid at night he had nightmares because the voice scared him and i don't blame him at all. plus it was hard to hear on the kindle fire. so other than that it was fine.
__label__0 The app did not work was not happy about it so my commen is not a good one about this product
__label__0 I chose this app because it has the opportunity to compare different versions of the bible, side by side, offline. Most of the features shown in the preview wasn't their after download. I'm not sure if they weren't downloaded, was not intended in the fre
__label__1 THIS APP IS GREAT FOR BIBLE STUDY AND YOU CAN EVEN GET ACCESS TO MORE INFO ONLINE. WORKS GREAT OFF LINE. WOULD RECCOMEND.
__label__1 This app is a drill sergeant!! LOLIt does not play around when it comes to your workout. Best trainer I have downloaded...love the gps and the fact that it is very, very accurate.
__label__0 The map feature comes up with your route with no map behind it, just a red line of your route. I find Map My Ride to be a far superior product.
__label__1 I am walking for my health. The Runkeeper helps me keep track of the progress I make each day.  I compare the results of each day with the previous ones.
__label__1 this helps get me motivated to get up and walk and it makes me feel like I actually accomplished something when I get done to look at the results and the path I walked.  they have a setting for walking, running or bicycling. gives calories burned, voiced
__label__1 I enjoy this program, and have it on both Kindle and smartphone.  Easy to keep track of my daily activity, helps map out walking/running courses, and encourages me to stay the course.  I recommend it!
__label__1 A great tool to keep your apps organized. Easy to find your way around and use. I use it a lot.
__label__1 I use my ViewSonic gTablet to display Sunday Church programs and meeting schedules that change each week.  My SD card was filling up with outdated programs which with my limited skills I found onerous to delete.  This little program has made the process 
__label__1 this is the perfect app for anyone who needs to manage data on their kindle fire without the aid of a Pc. excellent for getting rid of accidental downloads and duplicate files.
__label__0 its so stupid ok. yeah I don't really care for the reviews but this app is so. I cant even explain the pics on the cracked screen don't even looked like its cracked its dumb. I tryied to remove the app from my kindle it wont waste of space don't buy
__label__0 I got this one as a simple time waster.  but it really is nothing with using.  I get is free, but even basic broken screen prank apps will break where you touch, this one only has a single image per break type I'll pass and get a better one, still free..
__label__0 it sucks and i uninstalled after trying all the diffrent screens, in other word three seconds latertwo thumbs down
__label__0 Not very funny.  And no, I was not convinced that my brand-new kindle was broken.  It is just a stupid prank.
__label__0 The graphics are very, very, very bad. The only way to turn it off is to completely shut down your device (Kindle Fire).
__label__0 I thought u would actually open the app it doesn't hide status bar had to go into to apps menu to delete it. everytime u tryed to delete it from main menu all it would do is crack not convincing either
__label__0 i  put it on my kindle fire and it stayed and i had to turn it off i wish i could rate it lower
__label__0 trust me to NOT GET this app it froze my kindle fire and it doesn't even do what it says
__label__1 Great gag app, I use it all the time. It is good for snoopy people that look over your shoulder.
__label__0 u don't even need this app if u want your screen to crack just.throw it on the ground then there u.go a broken screen
__label__1 I tried this app on my mom and she was SO mad at me for 'breaking' my new kindle fire. And it was hilarious!!! I would definitely recommend this app to anyone. It looks so real and it will fool anyone. I love it!!!
__label__0 i got the app then i pranked some people in my family then whenever i launched the app i quit it then whenever i touched something it would launch the app wtf!!! you should change that do not get i deleted it
__label__0 plz. don't get this app. everyone can tell thy its fake... don't buy this its a waste of app.space. It kept crashing when I opened it... very lame, and not good.
__label__0 this is a waste of rime its crappy graphics if u delete it the screen keeps cracking.it looks bad Abe it suck

__label__0 First of all, this app is just a copy of Crack Your Screen. Second of all, it looks like a CRAPPY copy of Crack Your Screen. Just get Crack Your Screen, people. That's what I have.
__label__1 I luv this app because my mom thought I broke my screen and almost bought me a new onesincerely,Carlie Kitner
__label__1 this is awesome u can prank peaple into thinking your screen is broken if u do not prank ok its just me thinking.
__label__0 Three taps and the screen goes back to normal. Thats no fun. The app does what it says its supposed to but it should stay to appear broken unless you go in the menu and exit the app or something.
__label__0 this app is a waste of time.it does not look like it broke. it does nothing like my hermit crabs
__label__0 you can tell the graphics on the screen is fake. I kept on trying this app on people but everybody could tell it was fake. crack your screen is much better. get crack your screen its not a rip off.
__label__0 graphics suck and its totally useless.  uninstalled after about a minute. I'm actually upset that i cant remove it from my download history.
__label__0 don't get this app!!! it started freaking me out beacause it kept on cracking the screen. but then I figured out that u have to turn your kindle fire off, then turn it back on, then delete it.
__label__0 Hey Hey Trojan: I'm going to pop a hole your logic. what if touring have that kind of screen saverAnywho..tell me if you downloaded this app and kept it for more than a week and be truthful...the app gets old after a while unless you have a lot of friend
__label__1 I fooled my mom with it! She was going bonkers! I can't wait to try it on my dad! She was about to freak out and go really nutty! It is super funny!
__label__0 please do not waste your time on downloading this app it was poorly put together my lil brother can make a better app and its so unrealistic 1 star was I could give it a 0
__label__0 This app is terrible! It almost kept my screen on the static option, permanently. If you want your screen to look like a wild pack of buffalo stomped the poop out of it, be my guest. Because of my experience I would not recommend this app.
__label__0 This app is the worst app ever!!! It took a half hour just to get it half way downloaded!! So I advise u DO NOT I REAPEAT DO NOT GET THIS APP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
__label__0 This thing doesn't even look like my screen is cracked!! My friend tried this on her little brother and he even told her that it was fake!!! He even knew that it was an app!! DUMB!!!
__label__0 I got it and ones you have had it for a day evevery time you click some thing then it's cracked up every time its stupid don't buy it
__label__0 it was good until I didn't press it and it keep comingback on my screen I got mad but if u want that piece of junk then go ahead
__label__0 this app is really cool to trick people but i couldn't change the setting so i didn't really like it.
__label__1 I enjoyed drop it on pillows and picking it up and trying to make other people feel guilty. tricked my annoying nieghbor.  its free free free free
__label__0 When you turn the broken screen on, the app automatically gives you a frozen broken screen with no option to turn it off or to get it out of the way to do other things on the kindle. Had to delete it to make it stop. Thumbs down on this app!
__label__0 sometimes I accadentley click on it and it happens all thetime and I hate it. it is so annoying
__label__0 RIGHT WHEN I DOWNLOADED IT ANYTIME I TOUCHED MY SCREEN IT BROKE I WAS LIKE WHAT THE HELL I DELETED IT BUT IT WONT STOP CRACKIN AND IT GOT STUCK LIKE THAT FOR TWO DAYS!!!! WASTED MY TIME!!!  :[

__label__1 I luhz it if u don't then read the description. it does exactly what it says it does! Literally stop looking drop into it!
__label__1 I love this app it works great on my Kindle Fire,it does not crash,and it gets a good laugh out of me and my friends.
__label__0 I can't see how ANYBODY looked at these graphics and thought, &quot;Yeah, that totally looks like a broken PHONE screen&quot;, television screen. MAYBE, if it's my dead grandparent's black and white Zenith that they got rid of almost 30 years ago. Can't 
__label__0 The image looks fake and it seems the banner has to be disabled every time you use it. Don't waste any effort or time on this application
__label__0 I'm sorry, but this is a pointless app, good try thought, I can give you that. I would like to give a higher rating, but It's just not there
__label__0 Like i downloaded it and then i had to shut down my kindle and turn it back on so i could take it off because i couldn't click anything else without it popping up.
__label__0 I hate it I would be sliding through the games on my kindle fire I wouldn't press it it would come on it would take me a littel while to get it off I hate it hate it hate it
__label__1 Ha I can fitly prank my mom dad and grandma wow this will be helarias your talking about the oltoment
__label__0 It is the worst prank app ever in the history of apps. Just terrible!!!!!!!!!!!!It is a waste of storage use.
__label__1 its awesome I even tricked my grandpa. and my mom and my grandma its awesome and its ffffrrreee.  its bomb! coolness
__label__0 I excpected it to be actually realistic and cool but you can see everything behind the &quot;crack&quot; and when I tried to delete it all it did was keep going back on and I got so frustrated. I dont recommend this application but its your opinion
__label__0 this app is terrible. i could not uninstall it so i asked my mom for help and it took her an hour to get it off.STINCKS STINKS STINKS STINKS STINKS STINKS STINKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
__label__0 needs a lot of work and it is a horrible game I hats it its the worst game ever and I mean ever I would say to get reg of it it is terrible
__label__0 This is not good at all it only has one screen crack and it don't even let u go anywhere else like u have a real broken screen and can go play a game or something . And u can't change to a different screen crack.
__label__1 It's FREE... if you don't like it,  don't use it!  people need to stop being such haters. Be kind to others.
__label__1 I love this app I can prank my friends when they come over.  it is sooooooo fun 2 play with and a good waste of time!
__label__1 I myself have never played with this game.  My grand daughter uses this and she states she loves it.  So I believe it's good or she wouldn't use it.
__label__0 hey dev.. keep trying..glass break sound loops non stop on dx running gb. couldn't kill sound so uninstalled. that locked the phone up with sound still looping. had to do a battery pull.
__label__0 I got this app thinking it would be kinds cool to have. a cracked looking screen. It too me five days to fix this.. but whenever I tapped on anything on my screen to do ANYTHING... it wouldn't let me because then the screen would then crack... and wouldn
__label__0 This app will not fool anyone. It uses unrealistic sound and keeps the status bar available on the top.This is just a gimmick to use on old folks who have no functional knowledge of cell phones.
__label__0 I was trying it out when after it closed it kept on going. so I had to shut down my kindle fire if u like geting annoed sorry I'm ten. do not get it
__label__1 I love it I am going to prank my sister. I love this app I think tu shouuld by this app
__label__0 It is not fun. It is fun for maybe, what, five seconds? You just touch your screen to ' crack ' it and that is it.
__label__1 My mom fell for it and bought me a new one so hilarious I love this app very very fun
__label__0 this app is sooooooo stupid it crashes. plus the cracked screen would not even fool you if you had thirty beers I'm worning you don't get this app
__label__1 I fooled my mom, friend, and sister with this app! its great for leaving your device out in public. so people wont want to steal it if its &quot;broken&quot; amazing app!!! &lt;3
__label__1 I really prank my friends and cool......best app ever...........is cool :-) wow and cool app I will rate 5 stars
__label__1 Can't wait to use it on my parents y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y h y h th g BBC y h
__label__0 ... Is accurate in saying this app is a joke. I'll just say that you get what you pay for... And this app is free.
__label__0 Wat first I thought it was cool but after using for a couple minuets it started to make my kindle fire freeze and it wouldn't work I finally deleted it. plz don't get this app
__label__0 I HATE this app! I tried it on my KINDLE FIRE and it took me A LONG TIME to REMOVE it. See this is what it does You CRACK it and then you CANT see ANYTHING on the screen and it takes you FOREVER to take it OFF! I RECOMMEND you DONT get this app!
__label__0 boring but a little fun but good for a prank but after a while it will start to suck little.
__label__1 It tricked my sisters and she said ow so she told my mom and she grounded me f or a week I told her it was fake
__label__0 Not for the LG optimus, does not install at all. I was excited about this app and did look forward to logging into kongregate, its a great community, but sadly will not work on my phone. Also does not work without flash and there is already a free versio
__label__1 If you're familiar with Kongregate, then you know what this is all about. If you're not familiar with kongregate, then go spend a few minutes on their website. Now imagine playing those games on your phone. Not ALL games will please everyone, but with th
__label__0 this is 5 dollars wasted. on the kongregate website you can download the exact same app for free. merely slapping a &quot;pro&quot; in the name does not make it worth the ridiculous 5 dollar price tag
__label__1 It is easy and basic but can be challenging. It passes the time okay. I have played it many times and still like it. It takes some strategy but isn't so hard you give up.
__label__1 Don&apos;t know why Even put one star, this is a great game, fun give it a chance, hell it&apos;s free what can you loose
__label__0 That's right. I started the game today and it said I had to log into the Amazon App Store to play it.Not acceptable. Uninstalled.
__label__1 It took a few games to figure out what to do, but ever since then it has been a blast. I got it as the FAOTD and couldn't be happier. This is definitely an app worth paying for.This is a strategy game that is fun and keeps your attention (especially if y
__label__0 HTC Desire, the dice don&apos;t roll so I have no way of knowing if the app is worthy of a download. As it stands, if they fix the problem I&apos;ll fix the rating.
__label__1 I decided to pick this up as the Free App of the Day in spite of some of the poor and uninformative reviews and I&apos;m glad I didn&apos;t miss out on this great game.\nDo yourself a favor and watch the video! It is well done and explains the strategy i
__label__1 I loved this game when it used to only be on iPhone, I always had to use my girlfriends phone to play. Then I found the free version on the android market and now the paid version is free on here, its pretty addicting.
__label__0 ...until today's update, which included an insane list of new,  extremely intrusive permissions. You suck, Canned Bananas. You already had in app purchases included &amp; now this? Uninstalled.
__label__1 I downloaded this game when it was the free app of the day.  Not being a big fan of matching games, I was pretty sure this game would get uninstalled rather quickly.  Several weeks later, I can say that Lock N Roll is still getting quite a bit of play on
__label__1 I got hooked really quickly. The tutorial is really short, but there&apos;s additional info\/instruction available in the menu. Fun little game, probably going to have to limit myself on when and where I can play it. While laying in bed at night is defin
__label__0 Evo 4g dice do not roll. Can&apos;t play if dice don&apos;t move. If this is fixed I&apos;ll try again and update review.
__label__0 1 star because the app was fun until it started force closing on me and trying to donkey punch my phone.
__label__1 Fun game but once you learn the trick of clearing the board it gets a little to easy and ends up boring around 150k you just want it to end
__label__1 Fun and challenging app. Not much to it but is quick to play and challenges you to beat previous scores with various ways to score and remove dice.
__label__1 This is really a fun little app for when you are waiting for a meal or in a doctor&apos;s office. I really like it.
__label__0 Would not even open on my other tablet.10.1" dual core @ 1.6icecream A 4.0Could be one of the best thing in apps, but, sadly, is not at allUPDATE to the above: They had an update, that made it work, for Tablet, but sadly, ONLY on the tablet. Kind of defe
__label__0 I am interested in the idea of sending pictures to my TV from a tablet.  I downloaded this and it was easy to install but it would not recognize my TV that I uses Wi-Fi to down load Prime  and Netflix movies and TV shows.  Maybe the TV is too old.  I bou
__label__1 Does what it says it does. If you want to toss up your movies and such through apple tv this is for you then
__label__1 Great idea, all You need is internet connection,....a lot of great movies and other shows, educational etc., I love it
__label__0 I have a Kindle Fire HD.  This app simply does not work with my Kindle.  Given it's popularity, I assume this product likely works best on Android phones which I'll try shortly, but my HTC One already has DLNA interface functionality built in.  For me pe
__label__1 cant believe i can watch anything on my tv that i can watch on my kindle....love this app and recommend it to everyone......
__label__1 This is the best app by far! I can say that it is very cool to send the videos your watching to your own smart TV. And easy!
__label__1 This app works on my Sony Smart DVD player and also works on my Xbox 360. Loaded with videos. I plan on buying the pro version.
__label__1 Hangman games are the best especially when you put your mind to the task. Fourteen categories are presented. "All" is usually my choice to save the man from his demise. if you let the simple design fool you another fatality is your surprise.
__label__0 never used, could never get it to do whatever it was supposed to do.  I guess I just didn't have the patience to learn how to play the game. removed it from my tablet.
__label__0 stupid dumb app this is. don't download it. no wounder its free.glow hangman is stupid four words don't download it'sstupid.
__label__0 Way to small on Kindle Fire can barley even see it and letters are so small you hit the wrong letters. Free app but not worth the download
__label__1 I love this app. Not only do I use it in the park,  I also like to browse through the lounge and look at the beautiful pics people take during their day. I hold a passport but I don't get there as often as I'd like. I 've never posted because I'm just no
__label__1 Very helpful when you are a visitor to Disneyland and trying to plan your day.  Comes in really handy if you have young children who do not do well in long lines.
__label__1 This is such a great app!  Thanks!  I can't wait to use on my upcoming trip to Disneyland and California Adventure.
__label__0 The members of this social club are beyond rude! I felt like I was in high school once again, very snobby!
__label__1 I always use this app and I love it!!! Always accurate and always keeping me updated with what's going on. I love how CMS are on here adding anything they know :)
__label__0 This could be a good app but when I always try to log in it forsecloses. fix it please and I will rate it better
__label__1 This was just what I was looking for to help keep track of the family budget.  It is easy to use and does not require an account on another website like some other budgeting apps.
__label__1 This app is a lot of fun. It taught me where our money goes.Then at the end of the month, I can adjust my spending.
__label__0 I was really looking forward to using this app. I have a kindle fire and it would not download at all. So dissappointed. I'm glad it was free but I still wanted to use it. If it would download I would have probably loved it. Oh well. Thanks
__label__0 Some of the reviews were good for this so I gave it a try since it was free. I found it to be a very confusing app and found it wasn't at all what I thought it would be. Don't waist your time on this app.
__label__1 I love this app. It's easy to use and I like how I can add all my accounts and credit cards as well as all the most common vendors I use. It gives an analysis of how much I'm spending and where. I keep track of all my bill payments on it too! Works great
__label__0 why do they need to know your exact GPS location and why does the frog randomly die? Why dont they have people test the games and apps before making people pay for them?
__label__1 I played a fair amount of Frogger on my Timex-Sinclair 1024 as a kid.  This is just as much fun, and with much better graphics.
__label__1 Sound and video runs fine. Controls are OK once you get used to it just like other games. No errors or anything like other people. Overall perfectly good game for 99 cents
__label__1 This is a fun application if you can get across. Just have to do more practice.Great grandson loves it and never gets across.
__label__0 It seems this game was designed for a specific screen resolution, and doesn't adjust for different devices. Screen elements are placed in very awkward positions. This is a very low quality production. Expect more from such a major player in gaming.
__label__0 I downloaded this game on my Kindle Fire and I was able to open it but all it did was play music which was very irritating.  I couldn't play the game at all.  I called Amazon and they credited my account and I uninstalled it from my fire....waste of time
__label__0 Won't install, so have no idea if its any good. Amazon sent me email like I got it but it throws error that it can't install. Droid2 global
__label__1 Classic frogger, cuter than ever.It does request gps location like the other fient scoring Apps I have, and it is frogger, so it will only work in portrait mode, neither of which is a suprise to anyone who has used fient or who has played frogger.Gamepla
__label__0 I wish I could at least try this game, but when I attempted to open it on my Droid Pro, it said "Must be played in portrait mode. Can't be played in landscape mode".  I turned the auto rotate off on my phone and it still wouldn't open. Amazon's suggestio
__label__0 Sucky gameplay and controls. Laggy response. Sucky graphics and music. Sucky permissions. For a game that doesn't connect to the internet, there's no need for GPS or the ability to discover your accounts.
__label__0 I can't think of a possible reason for Frogger to need my location or the ability to discover my accounts... and apparently neither can the developer because they offer no explanation.  I won't install this program until both of those permissions are rem
__label__1 I didn't have an issue with lagging on my HTC Incredible.  Just like I remember playing as a kid.  Is still challenging (or maybe it's just me, lol)  Love Frogger and am so glad it's a FAOTD.  Would definitely pay .99 cents for it :)
__label__0 Not fun.  Music Is so annoying and does not stop when you exit.  Do not bother with this one.  Uninstalled.
__label__0 It downloaded and opened successfully on my Archos 43 Tablet.  The music plays and the clouds roll by on the main menu page like it's working, but nothing happens when I try to play a game or view options.  Got the same results when I tried to "test driv
__label__1 Works perfect on the Inspire 4G with AT&amp;T Gingerbread update. Fun game, worth $.99 easy, even better free. Get it while it lasts.
__label__1 This is a fun game. A little reminder of where hundreds (maybe thousands) of quarters went. I'll have to be careful that I don't pull a George Castanza if I'm playing this while walking down the street.
__label__1 I read all of the reviews before downloading and still did.  Bad reviews due to operator error seem to be very popular with faotds and it's very unfair to the developers.I have been very satisfied with any Feint game I've downloaded and this is no except

__label__0 Why does amazon developers not explain the permissions they request? GPS and find all my accounts for frogger? Be nice to have am explanation for the request and if needed that  is fine.
__label__1 this game takes me back. nicely done. and it actually works on my p.o.s. temp replacement phone (htc hero) had samsung moment it got wet and broke. saving,for evo. anyways ty dev for making something us p.o.s. phone users can use.
__label__1 i was shocked to see that this game is exactly like the game i use to play at the arcade 27 to 30 years ago. its fun and its challenging. i recommend it to those who like a challenge.
__label__0 The screen is sooooo tiny! Too hard to play. Find a different version elsewhere if you want to play this game.
__label__1 Awesome port of retro arcade throwback to 80's era. It was a time of david bowie, big hair bands and one hit wonders. A time of mtv and arcade houses. Home based arcades and computers were lacking so the only place to play cutting edge videogames were th
__label__1 to play this as a young child so it was nice to know it is back for my kindle fire, i spend hours on this and enjoy my youth all over again.
__label__0 it's not a good omen when you have to tap the screen several times just to start the game, as nothings happening after the first tap. it only got worse - could not manoeuvre the frog at all. rarely do I rate an app 1 star, but this game fully deserves it
__label__1 Nice port of Frogger. Graphics are decent, controls are good (how else do you expect to play a touchscreen game if not by TOUCHING the screen and as a result, cover up some of the screen), and the game is not slow as some people have stated (even on my o
__label__0 this game is so horrible the controls are bad and its so slow who ever made this game was a waste of time this app id a piece of garbage
__label__1 this game is the best frog you could ever bye!!! totally worth 0.99 cents!!! if you have the money I definetly reccomend this game for you!!!:) :) :)
__label__1 I loved this game since I first had it on my laptop - I have been trying to get past the first level and it is hard - it is harder to play on the kindle but I still love it - second level here I come
__label__1 why people never happy with the free app of the day???? cmon people its free .if you don't like it don't download it.
__label__1 This is a good game and fun trying to keep the frogs from getting smashed and to get to the other side. You got to get it now!
__label__1 This game brings back memories of the original game, with a kick! I could sit and play for hours, if I had the time!
__label__0 I was happy to see this classic as the free app, but even for a free app this sucks. The controls are bad, the game is slow, runs only in the portrait mode and add to that it malfunctions - even after I exited the game the background music kept going on 
__label__0 Really?  Why would a game like Frogger need my FINE location data?  Is the game going to use this information to simulate frogs running across MY street from my home to my neighbors!  I don't think so.  Unacceptable invasion of privacy!
__label__0 I should have listened to the reviews. The controls are to slow. You get killed every time. If you're bored it might be ok.
__label__0 Sorry folks, no game should need the &quot;discover known accounts&quot; permission. Fine targeted advertising (using my GPS and draining my battery) is bad enough. Swiping my email addresses, Facebook ID and Twitter ID so you can spam me without telling
__label__1 Runs great on galaxy tab.  Fun and levels get hard enough for me.controls are ok. Just like old times, just nt as expensive
__label__0 what a steaming pile.  forget about the permissions, this game just doesnt have the feel and fun of the original.
__label__0 Good god... the music gets stuck in a loop and makes me want to scream.  had to force kill it.  not good.  sorry dev... Uninstalled to spare what is left of my sanity.  DroidX.
__label__1 Frogger is so much fun. My mom loves playing it, too, as she relives her atari days. Definitely recommend purchasing this game.
__label__0 I can be sitting on a log and just die, the screen doesn't fill my while screen...... what else can I say, this game is pretty bad, not the worst, but not worth a dollar, stay away unless its free.
__label__0 The game was great 20 years ago, but it needs an update to be good today. The controls were poor.
__label__0 Very sluggish controls, frequent crashes and poorly executed. Bad game on all fronts, cant hold a candle to the original.
__label__1 you can get by cars and I can travel on wood second level third level way better than first this app is the third best app I have and f.y.I. I have fifty-six
__label__1 The original frogger game, on the Atari, (yes I said Atari), was my absolute favorite. This is pretty close, all I need is a joystic. I've had no hiccups, freezes or problems with the running of it.
__label__1 if it crashes on your phone then thats not the dev fault, get a better phone or better build of android. i had the free version installed. needless to say its better without the ads and worth a buck if you like the classic arcade game. anyone expecting a
__label__1 This is a really fun app me and my friends play it all the time at school really fun awesome fun
__label__1 I'm surprised to see this in the app store. Just to let you know, people who are I their forties played this game as a kid. Yeah, it's THAT old. But it's pretty fun, so it wasn't a complete waste.
__label__0 I found this very confusing.  Also, it seemed to require buying weapons to use. I wasn't sure so I deleted it from my Kindle Fire.
__label__1 i also like this game. cause it is from the original atari. its just like what i grew up with. its fun.
__label__0 I think Amazon should make sure that the games they let on the Kindle-Fire works this game I have never been able to play I clicked on new game nothing happen so I have bought this game for nothing.
__label__0 As a kid of the 80's I got really excited when I saw this available. But it is horrible to play. The controls are difficult and the darn frog would die for no reason now and then. I gave up and uninstalled in frustration. AVOID!
__label__1 I love this game.I had it on the original Atari and also on X box.This app is just like the old  game and is easy to play.I would recommend it to everyone!
__label__1 Not like the old Atari game, but still entertaining. Of course the graphics are 10x better, but if you are going for old school this is different.
__label__0 Completely unable to play this game as it force closes each time I start it. Sometimes I get as far as starting a new game, but usually I don't get as far as the main menu. Motorola Droid 2 rooted
__label__0 music seemed to get stuck. slide control seemed to work okay, tap did not work at all. music stayed on after quick close, no other way to exit. oh and yes the dumb permissions.
__label__1 Get it. It will consume you! Games are quick and challenging. They are great to pass a few minutes or hours.
__label__1 I have played this game for ever.....it's fun fun fun......play it it's hard but you learn  to get  along I love happy happy...
__label__1 I've read all of the reviews &amp; decided to try it out anyway. Yes it's not exactly THE original frogger. So? This application works just fine on the Incredible running 2.2. Game play was just fine. Very smooth. Someone complained about their thumb cov
__label__0 controls  suck they work then the don't thought it might be my phones touch screen (HTC EVO 4G) but its the game. the music is not the right frogger music. so glad I didn't pay for this game. waste of time to even down load..... for those of u talking ab
__label__1 It reminds me of the old frogger game from years ago. Very challenging and loads of fun for everyone to enjoy.
__label__0 My husband really likes this game.  It can be challenging and he likes to be able to get farther against other opponents.
__label__1 One of my favorite games on my HTC sensation. no problems with lag at all. great classic look. love it! don't listen to all the whiners who complain about graphics. this isn't halo for gods sake. its a basic and fun arcade game!!
__label__1 First of all, to all of the 1 star ratings who are whining about "unexplained deaths"...The reason that you are dying is because each frog has a time limit to get across the road,so if you don't want to die, then pay attention and learn to play before yo
__label__1 Love this app.  It's just like playing the original, but with phone controls.  The graphics make it a classic instead of trying to improve something that already has fans in its original state.  Also, for the complainers that say they keep dieing, perhap
__label__1 yeah, I am not seeing any other difficulties others are complaining about. It took me a sec to figure out I had to swipe to move to us otherwise it is easy to use. Good simple game, probably a 4 star game but I gave it 5 to offset the asshats around here
__label__0 I love the idea of playing frogger again! Unfortunately, this app has a bad bug. every time I play this game and annoying song keeps playing over and over and over and won't stop even when I close out of the game. I have to shut my phone off everytime ju
__label__0 Very abusive permissions for a game. I can understand access to your SD card to save data, but why does it need to access your GPS or phone state or list of account names? I'm not going to install this one until they fix the permission requirements.
__label__1 Got this game for my great nephew on my Kindle Fire.  His Dad had teach him how play because I had never played the game.  Now I play it when I have little time.
__label__1 I loved playing this game on atari game system in the 80s and this one is much better then that one
__label__0 Unlike the other games you purchase for your kindle which fit the entire screen to play, this game only fills up the screen about the size of a iphone which makes it even harder to play as the screen is very small. Plus its not as much fun as when we wer
__label__1 This is one of my all time favorite childhood game. Now I can rekindle that feeling of being a kid again. Getting that frog to the other side is sometimes hard, but fun. I think anyone at any age would enjoy this.
__label__1 just like the old days sometimes its harder cause its touchy to play, but my friends are getting this one also
__label__0 unneeded security permissions. No paid game app that is local play only needes GPS access. internet is for the lousy crapware of Feint. recommend avoiding due to GPS alone.
__label__1 I chose this rating because this game keeps me entertained & is very colorful. I also like the idea that this game is on the Kindle Tablet. & that I can take it with me wherever I go. There is nothing that I dislike about this game & I would highly recom
__label__1 Old favorite of mine.  I enjoy using it and it brings back memories of the old days.  Thanks for the fun.
__label__1 The game works great on my Thunderbolt! No issues at all. These other jokers either need a new phone with a bigger screen or are just simpletons. They certainly are not members of Mensa.
__label__1 HTC Inspire 4G phone and this works great. Takes me back to my youth playing the game and now the next generation can be play. Graphics are just as primitive as they were back in the 80's but that's perfectly fine and adds to the experience by enhancing 
__label__1 this game is just as i remember it in the arcades!! if i can recalls the the controls were crapy back then in the break danceN era so stop winning
__label__0 Couldn't control the frog with my Kindle Fire.  The timing is off.  There is lag time between my direction and the frog's movement.
__label__1 I was pleased to see this game is like the same as the old Atarigames were. I would like to see more of the old games come back
__label__1 Just as much fun as other games that I played in the past.  Fast and mind boggling.  A good game to try.
__label__0 this game is just not good I love the classic and though this game tryst to be that it is not the controls are just bad and this game has sooooooo much lag just don't buy this crap becomes games like this should not exist
__label__0 The description said it was from 1980! That's the 20th century.How would anyone still like that game now days? I mean, seriously this old stuff will not sell that well these days!!!!!!
__label__0 Sure, I'll be that guy today. Why does Frogger need my location? Not trying out of spite. Word word and 20 more words.
__label__0 this version of frogger is awful! they buttons to.move the frog are terrible, which makes it very diffiicult to play. you also cant slide right  behind a car because it will kill you! don't waste the $1 on this game, waste it on something else!
__label__0 Starts playing repetitive sound, must reboot phone to stop. Glad it was free. More words words words. Nothing like real thing.
__label__0 was excited to play frogger- downloaded and installed just fine. When I opened the game it said to switch to portrait mode.  I WAS in portrait mode!  very disappointed.Droid pro 610
__label__1 Have only played a little as yet, but it seems to work as good as the ones I remembered. Looking forward to paying it more.
__label__0 I looked foward to playing this game. But it never came on on my kindle fire. Save your money, avoid this app.
__label__1 I love playing some of the old games from the 80's and early 90's.  I downloaded Frogger on my Wii as well.  Neither is an exact replica of the original, but both are still pretty good.Would like to see an exact remake someday.
__label__0 Good game, like the original, but what the company does NOT tell you, i it is all on-line! Frogger online!? Never been heard of! Wish it WAS offline playable, but it isn't!
__label__1 OMG! Just hopping away with it. Still recent from buying this game, and anxious to get ALL of them into their caves. Well, looks like caves to me. Don't turn your head on this game. Well worth the stars!
__label__0 After updating to Jellybean 10.3 from Samsung on my Galaxy S3 a small menu screen would come up but despite repeated key-presses nothing would happen.
__label__0 I wanted to stop playing because of the painful music, but after I exited and was back on my home screen the same stupid song kept playing.  Fixed that with an uninstall.
__label__1 classic, nuff said! If you don't like Frogger, stay away from this game auuuuughhhhh! For those of you who love the classics, ENJOY YOUR BUTTS OFF!!! Peace!!!
__label__1 I don't understand negative reviews. The controls work fine with no lag. Some people complained that their frog would die for no reason...thats because there is a time limit.
__label__0 Seriously, I would have expected better from such a major publisher. This game was designed around the original android handsets. Force closes constantly. And when it does &#34;work&#34; (and I use that term lightly), the game is essentially unplayable. 
__label__0 you can't get the sound to stop looping once you make it to a save slot. you have to restart the phone..
__label__1 I loved the 80s and this brings back all the good times. Really its worth it!! U have to get it!!!!!
__label__0 It's a shame to see Konami squander a trademark. The original music is gone an replaced by the sort of thing you'd hear in a 1993 shareware ripoff, the graphics are &quot;updated&quot; to about 1988 level, action is slowed down, controls are sluggish, an
__label__1 As usual another game that works perfectly on the epic 4g.  Everyone who complains about a game not working right should just step into the big leagues and get an epic, that being said this game is a great classic. The UI is intuitive and responsive.  Th
__label__1 great app replica of the original. controls easy and responsive all things given. I love it, especially when it's the amazon paid app of the day for free. adopt a shelter pet.
__label__0 This app honestly isn't that great.  Its just not the same classic gaming experiance.  Not that fun on kindle fire, don't suggest downloading it.
__label__1 I love the classic games.  And Frogger is a cult favorite.  This game was fun and I am glad I got it.
__label__1 Now I can play this game on my Kindle HD and I love it.I have always loved the frogger games.
__label__1 This game doesn't even come close to lagging on my phone. Anyone experiencing performance issues needs to seriously consider upgrading their device. The controls work perfectly, you can play the game with just one hand. There aren't any buttons, just swi
__label__0 Frogger is a terrific arcade game, without a doubt. It was such a blast, that, like some other great hits, have been ported from system to system (Although not as often as..say....Pac-Man). And now we see Frogger sitting right here on our phones. Is this
__label__0 I thought this would be fun but it was so slow and when I tried to jump it wouldn't do anything. never using this app again.
__label__1 Ahh the memories of playing Frogger on the first computer game venue! I was quite happy to see it as a downloadable app for my Kindle Fire! It is sometimes difficult for "fat fingers" to control the little button that makes the frog jump in specific dire
__label__1 If, like me, you think back fondly on the original Frogger arcade game then this Droid app will be a nice piece of nostalgia for you. The controls on a touchscreen can be a little, well, touchy. With a little practice you'll be dodging cars and hopping l
__label__0 I bought this app for my Kindle Fire  because I loved Frogger when it was popular when I was young. I downloaded the app but I couldn't get it to start. I wouldn't get off the home screen of the game. Very disappointed. I called Amazon and got my money b
__label__0 I downloaded this despite the 2.5 star rating &amp; I now understand why it has such terrible reviews.Some will tell you that the 1 star ratings are just people complaining to complain; that there's nothing wrong with this game. The truth is, this game f
__label__1 Ribbit!! What a fun game! I have loved Frogger ever since I was a child. I am so happy they have it for the Kindle! Great game and highly recommended! Don't kill the little frogs!
__label__0 I installed it, went to go onto the android market, and and it wouldn't let me on because I needed to log into my google account. Because of the permissions, I uninstalled this game, and all of a sudden I could get into my market without logging in! Wtf 
__label__0 It was hard to move the frog.  It does not play like the origional arcade game when i was young.
__label__0 The game makes you drag frogger to his destination, which is not cndusive to the fast action play style required. Samsung Epic
__label__1 I can't keep up with the real fast games and this brings back the days of the Atari,,,,, for you younger people that was the game that started it all, well pong was but that was different... this is a fun little game for my kindle..... all ages will like
__label__1 Love playing this game and it kept my 2 year old grandson excited.  he kept saying froggy mushed when the car or truck rode over him
__label__0 Slow, and not very good. The original was way better. This is not worth buying let alone downloading for free.
__label__0 I was pretty excited to try this app out although it had a few bad reviews. The first time I played I randomly died sitting on a log waiting to make a move. I figured I would give it another try. Second time playing I died in the same spot, safely sittin
__label__0 I disallowed the excessive permissions using LBE Security.Getting the game started was a problem, had to tap literally dozens of times on the menus before anything would happen.Gameplay was marginal. Did not properly scale to screen (right side of screen
__label__1 glad to see more cool app/games like this on here.once i saw what it was i was hoping finally a day without one star reviews, boy was i wrong, i am starting to  believe, that there is a small group of people on here that always, without fail, rate every 
__label__0 the game is in a mini screen mode that you can not enlarge, makes it extremely difficult to play. Don't bother.
__label__0 Well I tend to not listen to reviewers because you never know who is the developer or who the haters(competition) are. But I wish I had gone with my gut on this one. The controls are basic just like I remembered. but the background music seems to get stu
__label__0 Why do you need my location and read phone calls to play a game?  Not installing this game not even for free
__label__0 There is no reason this game should require GPS information, or a network connection. Completely unacceptable.  I would like to see more classics, totally free.  Your programmers don't need to eat or pay rent.
__label__1 Amazon says &quot;not compatible&quot;, I say works fine.  Great retro game, i should know, i dropped many a quarter on the arcade version.
__label__0 bad choice you MUST NOT GET I thought it ruined my kindle so bad I cant stand it really.LISTEN,DO NOT BUY
__label__0 Gps and internet for full version of frogger? No thanks. No need for either except for tracking purposes, which doesn't sit well with me.
__label__0 For all we know the permission to to send out known accounts could and probably some thing where they sell their info to companies. suspicious. DO NOT DOWNLOAD! !!!!!!
__label__1 Never cared for the original arcade version, but this one is very cool. Works great on my Atrix 4G. Great work!
__label__1 The game works perfectly on EVO. None of the issues reported were experienced. The EVO has a 4.3&quot; screen. Looks beautiful no distortion or black bars. The controls are simple...just swipe in the direction you want frogger to move. The pace is more w
__label__0 The controls for this game are absolutely horrible. Doesn't respond to input at all. Also die on the side of the road occasionally.
__label__1 Haha its real fun to use this app. i want voice of monkey in it to tease mah friend lol :0)
__label__1 A great little app!  A true time killer!  Having a blast sending stuff to my kids and sister!  Installed and runs perfect on my Samsung Fascinate.
__label__1 a. its freeb. its really fun!i sang the star spangled banner and played it in all the different voices.i also captured my cat meowing and it was pretty funny.app does what it says.easy to use and very fun!
__label__0 This app is good for speeding up or slowing down the frequency of your voice. It's good for nothing else.
__label__0 The only explanation is that my location (together with who-knows-what) is being collected.Hey Amazon, you were supposed to prevent these quasi-malware apps from entering your Appstore - not promoting them!
__label__0 Then it wears off and then you're looking for another app to play with. Not even sure what drew my attention to this app.
__label__0 I think I sleep installed this (dontask) anyway saw it on my phone and tried it. we'll to say the least the app was complete crap so I uninstalled it only to get a thanks for subscribing 9.99 a month text. so if you load this up check your bill
__label__0 Waste of time and yours just another app to keep you entertained for a few minutes that you will never get bake
__label__0 The app itself is fun with a lot of great options. However it sucked the lifeblood out of my G2. About 10 minutes into using it, my G2 got SO slow that it was not useable. I immediately uninstalled this app, and the phone was instantly returned back to i
__label__1 This voice changer is great.  We have alot of fun with it. Try to record someone without them knowing and listen to it.  That seems to make it funnier.
__label__1 I have used this to make custom ringtones for friends and family many times now.  Its also a great time kil with kids and fun to use to play tricks on people at parties.
__label__0 Caused my phone to freeze up and reboot itself several times after install.  Pretty cool app otherwise.  This was on an HTC Incredible
__label__0 This is really bad. First of when I tried to use the voice effects it wouldn't play. Then when I tried to exit out to the home screen it freezes. Really bad app I deleted once I got it :(
__label__1 Anything that will entertain the kids for awhile, gets 5 stars. Is it juvenile? Yes. But the app is a good one. Lots of options, plus you can save it for later embarrassment.I also think I may try the 'backwards' option while playing some songs that have
__label__1 This little app is soon much fun. Everyone has to get in on saying something when you bring it out.
__label__1 First of all, thank you to the dev for making this great app  free! I have been playing with it, and not only is it a decent recorder in its own right, but the options are fun and they work very well! Cheers on a great, fun app that is so much fun to pla
__label__0 Shame on you!!!This was a science project at school right?  If so, I give you a B+ grade.  If you are an adult, don't give up your day job as I know children that can write apps better than this.
__label__1 I think this app is great . Its probly the best voice changer app there is.when I got it it didnt tell me how to save the recordings though.I figured out that it was the botton to the left , it sort of lookes like a printer . Anyways I really recomend th
__label__0 it is gross.  don't buy it. it is so disgusting. I don't like it. so don't buy it. it is so hilarious. don't even look at it.
__label__0 This is the worst game EVER even my kids hate it its just throwing money away never buying games from these makers again. By the way never waste ur $0.99 on it!!!
__label__0 the kindle fire doesn't even has a camera. the kindle fire hd does but it doesn't have a camera in the back so that would be a big waste of money
__label__0 I'm sorry if this is rude, but I don't know why anyone would want this. This is probably one of the stupidest apps I have ever seen on the amazon app store, and trust me i've seen a few. I can already tell by the reviews that it is a waste of time. Don't
__label__1 I love this app when you read it the 1st time it is cool then you have to do it to other people
__label__0 The problem with this application is that it is exactly what you expect it to be... Dumb.  Uninstalled after like 2 minutes.
__label__0 okay, it cusses......it promotes suicide. im an adolescent and suicide is a big thing and this aorta offended me being a cutter and all.....but that's just my opinion so whatever still I don't reccomend
__label__1 this appbis so addicting.  I mean the blowing up part is really funny. first you blow up the earth, then you blow up hell and heaven.. so basically, you make the world limbo. its funnier when you get the app. you should really get it. if you don't get it
__label__1 it is cool and it is funny I like it oh! did I ever say it is free to so please play it because it is you know what I'm about to say everybody say it with me ready set say it shut the front door good job everybody oh and good job everybody by the way I f
__label__1 its worth it just to annoy people. load the app and hand it to some one and see how long they go. it was fun on the first go through, now i just like to see how far other people will last.
__label__1 it is awesome and people will love it I like lt two a lot of people want two play it
__label__0 I do not like this app one bit all u do is press the button and it says don 't press the button.don 't download this app!
__label__1 Some people think its a waste of time but its really just an app for people looking to pass the time!! You people saying its a bad game just don't have a sense of humorous obviously!!!
__label__0 wth no this def a waste of time n space. no idea why it has so many ratings. its fun for about 2 clicks n then its time to remove it.
__label__1 I LOVE it, it is so fun I love it if u r looking 4 a game that go's 4 a while and read funny stuff then it's perfect 4 u this is Dan PEACE
__label__1 It is very funny. Mainly the explosions are funny. And when it said the h-word it meant the UNDERWORLD notthe curse word. The game is funny I reccomended it foreveryone.
__label__1 this app is great! not much to say. get it get it get it! blah balh blah blah blah blah.
__label__1 this game is so much fun because I like pushing buttons.push push push.so anyway read the text it FUNNY!!!!#!!!!f.is for funny.u.u should get it.n.never dingier button pushing.
__label__0 this game is the stupidest app I have ever gotten before because all u do is hit a button over and over again and all it does is repeat the story sou would not get this app
__label__0 um. Just read the title of this review again. Do you get the idea now? I sure hope so.  'nuff said.
__label__0 I don't  know why its on my kindle  I want it delete , please sent message how to delete because manage my kindle did not delete them for me
__label__1 I love this app it is awesome and I think they should get one that does toilet humorous then it would be like tart peer pooop
__label__0 This game is amusing once but needs more stories or a longer story. I did not want to stop playing but the story ran out so I deleted the game. Please add more makers of the game! Oh, I would never pay for it so if they start charging for it do not buy!
__label__0 It really is just a button on the screen. That's it. I was bored after about a minute. I thought, &#34;Haha this will be hilarious.&#34; No, not at all.
__label__0 Duh. Someone must of been really bored to sit around and create this. Again, duh. &infin; _ _ _ _
__label__0 this game is fun the first time but it just repeats its self don't waste your space and get it you'll hate it
__label__0 I downloaded this game and it was fun for about 2 seconds but then it got stupid don't get this app waste of time
__label__1 its just a fun way of wasting ur time if ur bored! geez people lighten up. you basically press the red button and it tells u ti stop, etc. it has sounds on it too, so watch out!
__label__1 This app literally had me on the floor laughing! The comments the button makes are hilariously rude, but of course, it's funny! When I showed my friends the had the same reaction as I did. If you are having a bad day and need to laugh at something, like 
__label__1 I prolly would have given a 4 star because I've done the whole red button thing on the internet years ago, and it was funny as hell back then when it was fresh, shiny, and new. But I gave it 5 stars to try to counter the negative nancys reviewing this ap
__label__1 This game is so simple yet so funny. I just texted all my friends and told them to buy it to.
__label__1 Can some one  say, &#34;How to keep a child entertained and reading for 30 mins or more.&#34; Just give them the phone and tell them not to press the button! They never follow directions and this hold their interest for a while; very funny.
__label__1 To be honest at first I was too scared to press the button. But the more I pressed it the funnier it became. SO I JUST COULDN'T STOP!!!Even when it started repeating, it was still funny. It's always fun to watch your friends play it. SO IN YO FACE,PEOPLE
__label__0 I got this and it is the worst game ever created. All you do is press a button when you're not suppose to. Even when I stopped I had to press the button,  because nothing happens when you leave it be.
__label__0 This app is a waste of time, and very wired. I don't like what happens at the end. Very lame.
__label__0 the app will never satisfy me even if this so called &quot;appzap&quot; company updates it the best thing about this app is the price
__label__0 wow that's a little stupider!  who ever made this must be a total loser don't get it unless ur an ediot
__label__1 Me and my cousin played with this for a while and it's really cute.  I didn't want him to push the red button and he kept on insisting.  Kept making us laugh.  Pretty entertaining in a crazy sort of way.  Fun to mess with.
__label__1 This is the best game I have ever play see ya on the game Try this stinking game I'm worning you you will love it if you don't like this game suckit up because you will not like it you'll. love it Peace.
__label__0 You press a red button then it sends messages to you for doing it because you aren't supposed to.If you think the Sunday comics, a pie in the face gag, or &quot;America's Funniest Home Videos&quot; are funny ... then it might be for you.
__label__1 it is so funny!If it said I will cut your head in a toothbrush kind of way I would laugh so much I would cry.
__label__0 I don't like this game . Because this game does NOT have a touch of fun in it. Do NOT get it and all you do is touch one button then it will say STOP well of course I didn't stop so then it did 8 buttons. Then like 44 buttons please don't listen to the o
__label__0 This app is completely boring! I was expecting some scary face or something to pop-up in the screen, but this stupid app just repeats itself! It's no- doubt a 0 star app! In other words: DEFINITE TIME WASTER! D: not recommended for anyone with a life!
__label__1 it is amazing but i think it says heaven blows up witch is horrable but other that that awesome super fun
__label__0 THIS WAS THE BIGGEST TIME WASTER EVER IT SUCKED BIG TIME. IT WAS SO BAD MY REVIEW IS IN CAPS!!!!
__label__0 this is so stupid it just says stuff like don't touch the button don't touch the button again if you touch the button 1more time the world.will explode don't install this app it sucks
__label__1 this was the best app ever I laughed the whole time great job anyone who doesn't like this u don't know what fun is
__label__0 it was fun at first but once I saw my daughter play it and it said that it would recommend suicide. and up to 9 layer of hell and that you exploded. heaven and hellI do not regimens for young children
__label__0 this app is both inappropriate and quite intolerant because alot off its content is offensive and i highly recommend not to get this app
__label__1 I love this app. Its so addicting, yet so point less. I reccomend it for anyone that is bored and has nothing to do, or is just looking for a little humor. All you have to do is press a button. Its that simple! haha (:
__label__1 ok that was a super fun game the part when it said boom a screamed but these ppl apparently. don't have a sense of humor they are stupid who ever made this game up THEY NEED TO make another game like this Ps don't waste your time looking for the white bu
__label__1 To have lots of fun you have to read the text! For all of you who gave this app 1 star read the funny  TEXT!!!!!!!!! This game is very super fun!!!!!!!!!
__label__1 This game is amazing ( not even a game)  ITS A BUTTON!! idk why but this is hilarious. Get this game!!!
__label__1 Love this app! I think it is awesome. I did not want to put it down. it is good if you are bored. and it's free.
__label__1 Ok I don't know how I have  become addicted to this app but I will be honest.I'm addicted.The captions are a little funny. But I wish it would say something else if you don't press the button. Like, &ldquo;Thank you for not pressing this button&quot; or 
__label__0 this app sucks. I lode it to my k fier and deleted. it right away all it did even. when u pushed. the button. is repeted its self &iexcl;&iexcl;&iexcl;&iexcl;&iexcl;
__label__0 This is by far the dumbest app I've downloaded yet. Don't press the red button, so of course you do. Then it has some smart alec remark at the bottom so you press it again. And again and again. That's it. That's all you do. Nothing else happens. WHY?????
__label__1 This is so funny. It is AWESOME. I'm addicted. I had to play it like 5 times before came here and wrote the review.
__label__1 It's funny the first time. It's really cool to show to friends. But after that, it's pointless. Give it a try. You know you want to.How can people possibly complain over something free like this? Were they expecting something epic with a name like this?
__label__0 all you do is press a bitten an seriously I'm its not even funny. &gt;:( I hate it it is so stupid.
__label__1 Cool app it is so fun and funny I prefer it for you good time wasterGood bye see ya
__label__1 I wrote one like this way back in the DOS days. I love it and very intelligent people I show it to can't put it down.
__label__1 such a funny game! o laugh every time! P.S. PRESS THE RED BUTTON!!!!!  haha hahaha hahahahaha ha haha haha haha
__label__1 this button is solo funny! he is so random, too. but the funny kind of random. but he gets mean. but its funny when he gets mean because he says he will do things he is unable to do. seriously. I mean there's no way he could ever do the things he says he
__label__0 i really didnt get this app at all the cover of the app may seem interesting but not as some of you would hope
__label__0 Tried this just to see if it would work with the Droid X2. It does. But useless and boring program. In my opinion.
__label__1 very fun app. I don't know why people r giving it bad reviews, because this app just rocks. I would totally recommend it.
__label__1 it is five star the first time u play but then stuiped.so u get play it delete that's what I did but u may not just get it it is funny
__label__1 this app is so stupid it is amazingly hilarious! yeah it says some choiceful words but! it is supposed to be taken light heartedly! it is a red button for Pete sake! its not like it means it! I cracked up when I started to push the red button. it will ge
__label__0 its a dumb App do not get it it tells u r gonna die and the world ending like wat the heck also to comit suicide and to go to hell and one more thing it SUCKS!!!!!!!!! don't wast ur time
__label__1 great time waster and a good laugh. looking forward to the kids playing with and seeing they're reaction! BOOM! still looking for that white button though :P
__label__0 The rules obviously say that you have to be 13 or older to leave a review. There are definitely younger children than that leaving them. There HAS to be a way to make sure that these ridiculous reviews are deleted or not even placed here. I have seen so 
__label__1 at first its really funny well the whole first time u do it and the second time it gets old quick but I recommend getting lt its fun and if u donit to others to its goodz.
__label__0 Waste of time and space on your device. Don't download it, it's not fun at all. Even if it is free, you will regret wasting that time.
__label__1 this is a very good app for killing time or giving it to a friend to press but the only rule... do not press the button
__label__1 My friend has it on her ipod and when she let me play it I so wanted it. so I got it. if you want to get a funny app. get dumb ways to die it id HILARIOUS
__label__1 this app is hilarious I have to admit it, this a great time waster. it wouldn't be fun the second time though but that is the way it is I would like it to say different things.
__label__1 hi my name is Elizabeth Chyenne Cline and I think this app is awesome and the most funest game that I have ever played in my whole entire life :) :) :) :b :p :v :o
__label__0 I HATE THIS APP DO NOT GET IT. WASTE OF SPACE.ALL IT DOES IS INSULT U.THE PEOPLE WHO GAVE OVER 1 STAR ARE NOT SO SMART.AND THEY LIKE RUDE THINGS.PLEEEEEEEEAAAAAASE TAKE MY ADVISE AND DO NOT GET THIS APP
__label__1 Its so funny. You cant really do much with this app, but it just a fun app. After you read all of it, it just repeats and repeats.
__label__1 This app is THE ABSOLUTE BEST for curing boredom. Show it to your friends, and I am absolutely sure they will laugh. That is all there is to this hilarious app. So simple, and yet so funny. There is amazing character in the narrator, and the puns are THE
__label__1 And it doesn&apos;t get much better than that. It loops eventually, but the dialog is witty. Enjoy it, even one smile is worth it.
__label__0 It is a waiste of download .  Do not download. It would be better if there alot of different colors.
__label__0 you just press the right button and that's all. I had it unistalled, I've got better things to do rather then just randomly press buttons. for some of you this app might be great, but for me it was pointless.
__label__1 a sense of humor. Don't bother. Not something *you're* going to play more than once, but cool to give to others. Earned its 5 stars it is what it says it is. Whatever you do however, DON'T PUSH THE RED BUTTON.
__label__1 I like it but its has the h word in it but it is very funny and cool. So people who is reading this please play it please????Peace out home rommyes lol I love me!!! Am I fuuny??
__label__0 I'll tell you all you would want to know about his game. It sucks, the quality is disgusting, the buttons aren't even realistic, the &quot;harder&quot; levels stink. It's just a terrible game made for terrible people.
__label__1 ...ALL DAY LONG! Seriously! AND, I recommended it to all my friends.How much productivity is being lost daily from just this one app?
__label__0 it just loops back around when you are done. not fun at all. sorry but I am going to uninstall.
__label__0 all it does is say mean things to you. at the end of the story he tells you, it starts over and doesn't shuffle anything onceoever.
__label__0 this game is stupid. i mean really stupid. i just tells you to keep pressing the button but nothing happens. at first i thought that the game was just an ad but no it wad the freaking game!! it sucked.so don't get it ....thank you and good nite
__label__0 Not interesting. Not inventive. If you have the attention span of a moth, you might find yourself continuously gravitating towards this app. If not then you, like me removed it from your device!
__label__0 don't ever get this app because it says you a a moron so never get this app K never buy this app
__label__0 If you have about 10 minutes that you would like to kill then you should download this... play it for 10 minutes, and then delete it.  It's not worth the space to keep it on your device.
__label__0 this app is nit entertaining not is it funny. when I first saw it I thought I would just dismiss the bad reviews but it really is a pointless, useless, and non entertaining!!!!
__label__0 Dumb. There is no good reason to download this app.  Total waste of time. Sure, it 's harmless enough. And pointless.
__label__1 Do Not Press The Red Button.  Another mind game, albeit simple, to keep the mind active.  Good for all ages.  Time consuming and slightly mind numbing.
__label__1 hahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha! That is so funny I like the story at the end. Its a good app. And I'm glad its free
__label__0 This is a SUPER STUPID app! I hate it! Its for like 3 year olds. That's all I have to say about this dumb app. Don't waste your time downloading thus silly app.
__label__0 At first when I saw this I thought it be kind of like &quot;The Moron Test&quot;. I was thrilled since it was in the top 100 out of 10 THOUSAND apps!!! When I first played it I thought it was OK. It was when it repeated the same stupid conversation like 
__label__0 i cant beleive it actually took longer to download this and install then it did to lose all interest in it.  then i continue to waste time to uninstall and write this review.  find something better to do with 5 minutes of your life.
__label__0 What started off as semi-humorous QUICKLY became non-entertaining and boring. there's no point to this app. good thing it's free!
__label__0 this app is totally inappropriate it keeps telling u to commit suicide and go to hell and that ur mother would hate you. not cool.
__label__1 its really funny and its there when ur bored but y would u put the h word I mean wit if there r kids that got this app but I like it :p
__label__1 its so fun my 10 year old daughter loves it but it says the H word but MUST GET IT!!!!!
__label__0 this game has to be the most birding game I have ever played if you want to be bored to death by this game.
__label__1 its point less yes,  but very entertaining. Great time waster,  and really it can keep me entertained for hours. Is it because I'm an idiot? Nipper that's not it...
__label__0 I loved it.....not terrible fun at first but omg terrible do not get it boring not fun at all well ok I exaggerated but it does get boring trust me even my 4 year old little brother hated it ok does that tell you anything a 4 year old hates a stupid game
__label__0 Some things are great pointless, but this app is definatly not one of them. Might be a little better if they could actually spell. Not even worth a free download.
__label__1 u should totally get it its free and then it is awesome its very funny. thats wat its meant to be like u should at least try it!  :-]
__label__0 I hats this app I loaded itcand showed my friends and that wanted to brake tho prone wost game ever
__label__1 this app is sooooo funny it makes me giggle every time I play IT! he just keeps going and never stops it is awesome! I would totally recommend it to anyone!!!!!
__label__1 this app is soooooooo funny in a dumb way its so irresistible to touch the red button *urk *. I'm 13 and its really fun for everyone over my age because it has swears.
__label__0 this is so stupid I would rate zero if it let me I suggest Oregon settler instead buy that game
__label__0 This app is more than useless. It was a waste of bandwidth to even download it. I want my MBs back!
__label__0 this thing is so dumb I didn't. even have to finsh the game to know that really don't get it it will make u cry
__label__0 cant even get past first level confusing and stupid a b c d e f g this is more fun then the game singing the Abc's
__label__1 this app was so funny and entertaining that I just could not stop playing it! I also love the twist ending. you should definitely get this awesome app!
__label__1 awesome I love it I like pressing fed buttons it is very fun!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  and you can play it all day and not get board of it rocks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
__label__1 this game is so adicting and it is relly funny as the button tryst to get you to stop pushing him. you need to by  this game it is so fun :)
__label__0 all you do is press the red butten,and if you don't press the red bitten well....the game is over see what I meek,such a rip off know wonder it was free.
__label__0 on a scale of 1 to 10 it would be a 1.5 it is kind of funny until i reached the part where it made noise i had the sound on full and couldn't hear right for the rest of the day. DO NOT BUY THIS IS STALE.
__label__1 lol this game is great my 3 year old loves it but it says to many bad words.but great game
__label__1 my new favorite thing to do. its hilarious and a great way to spend time. definitely worth downloading if you like senceless humorous
__label__0 this game is so stupid this guy is just telling us stupid stuff this game doesn't even earn a star that's how stupid this game is
__label__0 This app is not amusing and it is really no fun. It stinks! I think it is a really retarded. Nobody I mean nobody should get this app at all. I didn't even want to give it one star
__label__1 Loosen up, people! This app was meant to be funny and idiotic. So what if it only entertains you for a minute or so? It's great to show friends and to have a little laugh about it!
__label__0 The only reason this game is so high in ratings is because people see the &quot;do not press&quot; and they just download it , this game is really immature
__label__0 wow I blew up the earth thats for little kids but  it's great on kindle fire I absolutely hate this game.
__label__0 this app is repetitive and mean. what kind of app says u blew up the world, heven, and hell, I mean really! don't get the evil app, please.
__label__1 I meant to write all that in this onea s d x z w e r f c v ft. a s e e s s ss s s s s s s s s ss s s s s s s s s ss ss s s
__label__0 I saw that most of u said it was good but its not entertaining at all its the most boring. app In the intire. world
__label__0 so all you do is press a stupid button &amp; it insults u? why would u want to get that?!?!?
__label__1 I love this game because it is so hilarious. expecly the ending part. I totally recommend this game for anyone who likes to tick off people.
__label__0 I don't get the point. nor did I think it was funny, but I don't know why seem people are freakin' out about it. Dumb! Delete!
__label__0 ALL YOU DO IS PRESS A RED BUTTON AND READ THE TEXT THAT IT GIVES YOU. THE STUPID RED BUTTON SAYS THINGS LIKE WHY DONT YOU KILL YOURSELF OR YOUR DEAD AND BECAUSE OF YOU SO IS HEAVEN AND HELL. ITS DUMB THEN THE GAME REPEATS ITSELF SO I DELETED IT IN TWO MI
__label__0 This app works well but it says stuff like &quot;BOOM! You've exploded Heaven and Hell!&quot; &quot; You exploded the earth!&quot; The creators of this game are STUPID!! My Best friends Sister Played this shes only five and she really thought she explode
__label__1 hi I love this game it is soooo a waste of time I just live it. :) thankyou for making this app :) .
__label__1 this game seems really fun to me I can say it is funny to the words the animal says so that's all I have to say good buy.
__label__1 it is fin the sayings are cute and its pretty fun to play it isn't something I would do for 5 hours straight but its free so it was worth the download
__label__0 this is the worst appli ever. who rated this 4 or 5stars? no way. just wasted time. i don't understand why this is the top sales in amazon.
__label__1 This app is basically like reading a short story where you prompt the next page by pressing the red button which the narrator is constantly telling you not to press and making fun of you the whole time.  The product page description is worth checking out
__label__1 i love it!!! it is hilarious!!!! it is super funny and makes me smile and laugh! good to show to friends!!
__label__1 funny !!!! makes me laugh 90% or the time :) hahahahaha lolz. , and the a elephant it on top.of the button!!!!!!!!!!
__label__1 It is a good time killer, but it isn't hilarious. You should probably get it. I did. It is okay.
__label__1 its fun but wen it repeat itself its gets boring work with me Its awesome because of the funny words
__label__0 padded reviews for a piece of junk... boo. lets try harder next time.. mmm k? . .  ..  j j
__label__1 I laughed my butt off while clicking the button. I screamed while laughing, unexpecting a random sound effect. I recommend this to anyone who loves clicking buttons, laughing, being insulted. and ignoring subtitles.
__label__0 A prime example of a waste of bytes. Even kids under age 10 will only get an hour or so's use out of it...
__label__0 This game seemed sort of ok for the first couple of minutes, I thought that it would be like the moron test but instead it was just rude! It tells you that you are going to die, and blow up the world! Do you really want to play a game like that? Its also
__label__0 this game is sooooooo pointless. But actually a great time waster I finally deleted it cuz I had the conversation memorized! DON'T DOWNLOAD!!!!!!
__label__1 I like do not press red button because it got my in a good mood and its care od funny
__label__1 The button like.. talks to u. It so funny but I wish it said more though. He begs for u to stop pressing the button. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS APP.
__label__0 This app is bull poop. Why would someone want BULL POOP?!??! And by the way AppZap, here's  some advice: just because it's free, doesn't mean people will want to buy it. :(
__label__1 I know all of you people give this app low ratings but the app is made to be funny so don't Hate on it. I still don't get how it is number six on the list though
__label__1 It's not really an app, just a loop of the red button joke, which I find funny personally. Not really something to use all the time, but it's good for a joke now and then.
__label__0 this is the dumbest thing since sliced bread. not funny and now I get to waste more time trying twenty words.  almost done I think
__label__1 I an not sure what I expected but this was not what I expected. Very clever  fun and people, it is FREE stop complaining... I got more than my moneys worth so to speak
__label__0 Don't download this lame attempt at humor.  If you think carrot top is funny MAYBE you'll get entertainment out of this, but I seriously doubt it.
__label__1 Its fun and cute, but I'm not the kind of guy who can keep playing this kind of game. But I got it as a free app, and it was fun once or twice.
__label__0 this game sucks. when I first played this game I almost died so don't play this game buy a free gazer gun for your apps
__label__1 There is a point . It's an Awesome time killer ( it's everything you want in a app and more).That button in my opinion is awesome , but it's not as eye popping as EVIL ( so thats why i put that in my title ok).
__label__0 This is the stupidest app ever.  Even for free, it costs too much.  It's like when a four year old says something funny, and people laugh, so said child repeats it a hundred times, ever louder, thinking he can duplicate the reaction over and over.  Yeah.
__label__1 this was the best thing to do very fun and funny did I say how fun this app is to fun for words fun fun fun
__label__1 This was so much fun! A few capitalization errors but, overall this was very entertaining. I will keep it installed just so my friends can have a good laugh too.
__label__0 it was absolutely horrible I hated it so much I deleted it, then I hot it again just so I could delete it a second time
__label__1 That was funny! It can keep an idiot busy for a very extremely long time! Lol! What fun this game
__label__0 Do you think hell is a good thing to say to kids think you teens it is nothing ti you but to kids it is a knew word and bad word if you are 8 or under don't get it it is just dumb and if you think bad words are cool the are not.
__label__1 I absolutely love this app it is sooo funny and its free so you should get it its perfect for when your bord!! get it!!
__label__1 It is very funny and time consuming to read and play with this little red button but I loved it.
__label__1 this game is so very funny. actullay its more hilarious. I mean there is this crazy, grumpy and fun narrator who gives u these fun quizzes that if u play all of them last up to like twenty full minutes. I mean if ur waiting to get something u can just pl
__label__1 the app is very entertaining. it is so funny. I hope this person can make a don't press the green button,blue button, green button, pink button, and so on. download it
__label__0 It keeps telling you to commit suicide and that your mom will hate you! I finally deleted the app after it told me I was dead about 20 times.I found that this was the worst game ever!
__label__1 please let me have it. It is so cool and I love it. It is taunting me to get it.
__label__1 to me it is hilarious. that he keeps telling me not to press it and then it makes that little explosive sound. its pretty good it use the h word but its still funny.
__label__0 ok it sours fun but no. it just keep telling you dont press the red bottom.then after time it says your dead. then the voice says it is going to sleep. then it starts over.
__label__1 REALLY FUNNY app. Do not press the big red button. If you do, just find out what will happen. You know you wanna. Do it.
__label__1 this is a everyday thing the first time u play it its so FUNNY fun fun fun fun fun!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! FUN
__label__0 this app is not what I thought it was.  It's stupid and not even funny.  worst app I've ever purchased even if it was for free....
__label__1 I thought it was really funny. It made me laugh a lot. I recommend this app to people who like pushing buttons and laughing. This app may be really stupid to you or you may like it. Give it a try.
__label__1 When I need to keep someone occupied for a few minutes, this is a great one.  I hand them my Kindle, and when I come back, the person is always still there, pressing buttons, with a silly grin on his/her face, and occasionally laughing out loud..  So muc
__label__1 It is really fun to press the button and annoy the the text more. This is super hilarious!!Made me laugh like crazy !!!!!!!!!!
__label__1 This game is so addicting! I've had my whole familly play it. I love the ones where it turd into like a million little red buttons. Oh yeah and the other one when it turns into an elephant
__label__0 was curious to what this was since none of the reviews were specific.  you try to hit the button and different phrases pop up while the button moves around the screen telling u to not hit the button. glad it was free and that it only wasted my time.
__label__1 gees peoples, this is meant as a joke. and if you are mad at it fir saying hell then loosen up. I grew up with my family saying that word and even worse stuff. this game is fun.me gusta queso
__label__1 watch tophatvideos on youtube and you will get 500x the amusement of this game...this game is amusing and makes u laugh...although it has no end it is fun. but wen it talks about the white button don't waste ur time looking 4 it because u wont find it.
__label__1 This app is fun and is meant to be a joke. If you guys don't like it,  then you must not get the joke. Take a joke people. I played this app several times and still found it fun. I would recommend it, if you have a sense of humor
__label__1 The only problem with this app is there is no music. Live this app, but my boss doesn&apos;t. I got put on a probation period cause I was using this at work and not helping customers. Wth? I love my evo 4g, leave me alone. :-)
__label__1 Omg its sooo funny it gets me every time I LOVE IT. whoever say a bad review if u don't like u soooo much then y do u even put a review about it personally if I were u I wouldn't write one anyways seriously this game is soooo awesomeBTW: if u put any rat
__label__0 This app is fun but as you get towards the end it starts to insult you and tells you to go to the place under everything! NEVER GET THIS APP
__label__0 I pressed every single button on the one that had like one hundred red buttons and it dident approve.so that is why.
__label__1 Human nature...you have to press the button cause you are told not to. Then you keep pressing to see the next message and you keep getting told.to stop.Its amusing. I wish it would change ideas though rather than looping. Worth getting for nothing and sh
__label__1 ok this app is meant to be stupid, thats the novelty of it. i love the dialouge of the guy, whoever it is. i could play this all day...
__label__1 This app is awesome, and I love to trick my friends with it. The red button is a story on an endless loop. I love the hilarious commentary from the button. Great :-)
__label__1 Yes, get this app!  It does NOT tell you to go to hell but in fact is a halarious way to pass time. The first time I played it, I laughed so hard I cried! :D
__label__0 l wish this game never came out becquerel it is the stupidest game in the world it should get zero stars because it is not even funny
__label__0 I hats this app. when it told me to commit suicide I was really mad. suicide isn't to joke about.
__label__0 the app was funny for me but I don't think kids 9 and under should play it it says rude things and says bad words it also says things that slung kind of evil.
__label__1 This was soo much fun, but it does say a cuss word 3 times. So I wouldn't recommend it to small children.
__label__1 why does everyone hate this app it does what it says it will j j j j j j j Nb j j bb j
__label__1 I liked this tame very much. was a lot of fun. I especially like the part when he says that hes not dead hes just text.
__label__0 don't get this app it just said don't press it again.now is that stupid or what?stupid right. I hate it so much
__label__1 This is soooo funny!!!!  I love it &gt;&lt;  Its plain funny, and I went through it with my brother and he was laughing so hard and so was I. XDDDDD
__label__1 really your not gonna go to hell and the world did not exploed and there is no white dot so the dot is lying and I do think its funny but I don't laugh
__label__1 yes some jerks would say its stupid but no its not stupid! in my opinion its a brain twister. excellent for younger children. I'm 100% sure!!!!!!!!!!!!!!-Madyson A. Cooper
__label__0 TO ALL PEOPLE:if u r reading this comment very soon the only red button u will be pressing is the DISTROY THIS APP FOREVER button!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
__label__1 I don't know why everyone says it is so stupid. it is actually really funny. I laugh every time. it is so hilarious. I love ot. it makes me and my friends occupied and it keeps us lathing for hours and hours.
__label__1 this is so funny! I loved and it still keeps me laughing! if you need a good laugh, download this app!
__label__1 its hilarious..... the text is so mean but who cares its funnier....  lol........ I play jokes on mi frnds wit it..... they gt seo mad
__label__0 I just don't understand how to make this work.  It's very confusing. This is just what I have done review
__label__1 its a good game its really funny it is the best game ever I am glad he or she made itI like the way it starts over do not press the red button
__label__0 I wouldn't waste your time on this app. it is very repetitive and get old way to fast. I wasted about a half hour of my life pressing a stupid ditgital button.
__label__1 its fun for a bit.  the secret to it is to go through it 20 times.  when you do that there is a cool end with a link to a website.  its actually worth the time to do it.  good luck and have fun.
__label__1 Best app. Fun, funny and entertaining. Best it is free so you can&apos;t complain about anything. Just dune random weiss fit the reentry bring mfg mfg jfk ideal posh bck buck lcm
__label__1 GggggggggggggggRrrrrrrrrrrrrrrEeeeeeeeeeeeeTtttttttttt tame fun and Dumb. oveal silly talking button game would pay 1doller /inmature but fumnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn.  must buy oh wait FREE
__label__0 this is truly a dumb app. all u do is repeatedly press a button while being insulted and told to go to h***. I cant even think of why somebody would want this. basically, it is only fun for people who enjoy being made fun of repeatedly. that is all this 
__label__1 this is really creepy cause I don't know what 2 do and what is gonna happen if I do can someone plz tell me!!!
__label__0 1-THIS WAS COPIED OFF THE ORIGINAL GAME FOR PC2-REPEATS3-PRESS IT4-YOU KNOW YOU WANT *SHUT UP STUPID APP*5-SAYS STUFF LIKE&quot;YOU ARE GOING TO HELL&quot; AND &quot;HEAVEN AND HELL IS GONE BECAUSE OF YOU&quot;Where is the report button?
__label__1 it is really tempting to press a red button any day so on this app you can press it without blowing something up or causing ww3
__label__0 So, I downloaded it because my cousin wanted to check it out. I admit, it entertained the both of us for about 20 seconds. This is not a game, it's a poorly made button made for purely entertainment reasons...there is no storyline or levels that you have
__label__0 extremely boring and repetative. thats the first words.that come to mind. and i have to say this is the worst app i have yet downloaded. that is DEFINITLEY saying somthing
__label__0 What is the big deal about this app? This app is so stupid! I do not think the swear words or any other abusive language does threaten me. What's so fun about this app! You just press a red button the whole time!!!! Sure what the red button says is funny
__label__0 Well that was pretty dumb if you ask me. What was the point? You just keep hitting the button. Wow
__label__1 this app is great! so funny! it just keeps going. I showed my friend &amp; sheloved it too!******** is what I rate it!
__label__0 all u do is press the bitten and it says words not fun bet there is a better app so don't get this app it is so not worth it
__label__0 This game is horrible. All you do is press a button. Then it says something. I don't like this game.
__label__1 it is awesome and I cant whait to play this game and I'm going to press the red annd I want to see what will happen when I press the red button
__label__1 well when I first tried it I knew withought a doubt it was going to be a silly and funny app! : )
__label__0 This is not for anyone who likes fun. I mean seriously, come on, AppZap. this would be better if the thing had more of an exciting responce. It is so repetitive, it's not even funny. Oh, wait, it is. HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!
__label__1 I loved this on the computer and now I can take it with me on my Galaxy Tab! obviously this is not a game. it&apos;s just a joke type thing to amuse you or your friends.
__label__0 this game is so stupid. all you do is press the red butten and then it says not to press the red bitten.so don't get this game.
__label__1 Gosh, i thought that when i opened the app, i would not press it. I waited, &amp; waited but nothing happened. I thought if i pressed it, something terrible would happen.I did. Want to know what happened?  Well find out for yourself.
__label__1 Very entertaining but as said before it is sort of a one time app. You get it, you laugh at it show to a friend and then delete it. but it is really really funny and I reccomend it to anyone who wants a good laugh
__label__0 all I have to say is it just starts over again there is no end don't get it waste of time
__label__1 for all those people who says it tells you to go to hell, and to commit scuicide,  cant take a joke. all it says is that your in a layer of hell. but you explode hell,  and that's good. I still like this app. for anyone who has a sense of humor, this is 
__label__0 i didn't like this because it was kinnda stuipd my little sis didn't like it ether and she is 1 years old this sucks if u ask me. byby! :/ i would give it 0 stars cuz it sucks byby
__label__1 This game was very funny and silly. It is great if you have about 10 minutes to kill. But I have to say, it is not for everyone.
__label__0 it won't download even though I have perfect Internet connection i don't know why it won't and was really looking foward to this game
__label__1 this app is hilarious!once u start u cant stop! p.s. don't waste ur time finding the white button. there isn't one
__label__1 so I just went on tapping this then at the end it said _____________________________________________, lmfao it wad so funny! its worth getting it for fun and entertainment
__label__1 great for those of us who just HAVE TO PUSH  THE BUTTON. but after a minutes, just got boring, ehh
__label__0 This is not a game. you wont win anything. Some may find this entertaining, but i felt offended at theresponses this &quot;game &quot; was programed to give. Not for kids either!
__label__1 I loved all the negative reviews after pressing the button. The instructions said DO NOT PRESS but you went and did it anyways. Great for a laugh especially getting the elephant.
__label__0 This game says swar words and it says i hate you...you suck(ect). IM TELLING YOU DO NOT GET THIS STUPID APP!! The game os really boring i agree that this app should no longer be existing. The people who say that this is fun well they are very very wrong.
__label__1 It's very entertaining! And it's also fun to watch somebody else play it and see their reaction ( my mom ). It's so worth it. :)
__label__0 This is the most pointless game on earth. It`s not even a game.... anybody who likes this game is a complete moron.
__label__1 This game is SOOOOOOO FUNNY u people who but MEAN stuff u just don't know how 2 have fun. If you need me ill be pressing the Big Red Button!
__label__1 isn't this just awesome the only think is that...... it keeps repeating it never stops I love it u will to
__label__0 This is so stupid whoever wrote this was an idiot I'm with the 6 year old this game sucks. I'm out
__label__1 A lot of people say that this game is pointless but who cares? its funny and very entertaining. luv sharing it with my friends!
__label__0 But it's not really worth the time and effort to download. I even feel like I am wasting my time reviewing this.
__label__1 it says not to press it, but you have to, it taunts you and teases you all the way through. just when you actually fear for your life, it's over. whew
__label__1 Lol! Definitely cute. Love blowing up the world. Keeps the kids busy and laughing! Works on my moment. Thank you!
__label__1 super funny also says that the world will explode hailrious if u like a good laugh I would recommending. on getting this app
__label__1 I love this app. it is for people that have a sense of humorous it hilarious I love it but I wish it was a little longer on the story I got a crack out of it. thank you
__label__0 -!? I have wanted this app for some time, now. When I got it, I tried it out I hit it once and I hated it!! After a few more times, I decided it was boring and I deleted it. I expected more from this app. I wouldn't get it, again.
__label__0 Don't Get This. Plz Plz Plz Plz. Don't Get This. My Friends and me Have this game, its Boring.(Warning May Cause Boredom). I don't like this. I like Brussel Sprouts more then this.
__label__1 My kids downloading this and they absolutely love it.  They are always playing this game and like the graphics on it.
__label__1 This "game", while ridiculous, is still fun. I can't imagine playing it often, but it' something to do when you have nothing else to do, or just need to smile. Also fun to have someone else play in front of you or to leave it sitting around where someone
__label__0 i got the game cuase my friend said it was pretty funny. like a crazy person i bought the &quot;update&quot; which just changed probably one phrase.  then i went through it again but it could as a matter a fact make a drunk sober enough to delete it.
__label__0 this app is not the greatest app in the whole world because u don't hardly do anything.I mean all u do is press a red button. and read what it says.don't get this app.'
__label__0 this is good Bhutan not educational.  it does not have a point toot. it is ssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo boring. with a caption BORING. Do not get this game. plus its #100 in the list.
__label__1 This app ensures days of fun and creativity. If I had to rate this game from 1 to 10 on addictiveness, this would easily get a 128,901,428. The developers did an excellent job of recreating an excellent real life hobby of many men and women and maybe enh
__label__0 Unless you have the time and patience, don't get this app. Its not like the Moron test like I thought it was. You just keep hitting the button and quotes come up saying &quot;do not hit the button.&quot; I say, &quot;Do not get.&quot;
__label__0 Not sure that I expected any better, but this is a complete waste of time.  Hopefully nobody made any money on this.
__label__1 this app is cool on on one of the parts aka when the world blows up it makes a boom sound and I got the app when I was in my bed in the dark and I had it on full volume it scared me so bad. I recommend u get this appif u want to laught
__label__0 ur just hitting a stupid button in a box.plus, it takes 10 minutes to do the whole thing if u read the text. then, I got to the end and it didn't even blow up or anything... it just repeats the whole freaking thing(sorry for spoiling it -_- )
__label__0 this I think is the worst app in the world don't wast space for this app its so bad I cant explain how bad it truley is.
__label__0 This game is a rip-off!!!!! All you do is press a stupid button and read what they it thinks. I thought it would be fun, but it wasted my time. Don't buy this app, it must of been created by lameos!
__label__1 i definitely laughed more than a few times.  very original and fun game.  Thank you! Go ahead and get it.  its free.
__label__0 this app only took about five min. to end so then u probobly new what I did with it. total waste of time never download it.
__label__1 works very well on my kindle fire and it is extremely entertaining!! it is definetely worth getting!! its funny too :-) :-)
__label__1 I think this is a really great app. There's a saying that says &quot;rules are meant to be broken&quot; If you don't go by this saying for this app, you'll be sitting with this device in your hand for however long your life is. (Or until you figure out y
__label__1 Not an app to keep, but funny for a download. Kills some time and somewhat amusing. Well made at the least!
__label__1 Ha! Funny, and for everyone saying &quot;this person had too much time on their hands&quot; and you don&apos;t? You&apos;re rating a &quot;Don&apos;t touch the red button app!&quot; We laughed, then uninstalled... Lolz
__label__0 This game is horrible! All you do is push a red button (even though it tells you not to) and it gets smaller. Then, as if to make the game worse, there gets to be more of them! You can't complain that its free, though.
__label__1 this game is amusing and fun but I did not know it had a bad word in it. but other than that I love this game the button teases you.  PUSH THE BUTTON
__label__0 I would not buy this again ... it had no point to the game ... maybe it was just me
__label__0 I do not recommend this button that's it a button press the button and read that's it!! it go's on&infin;and beyond
__label__1 ok people might not like it because it says every time you the button you will go a layer further in you know he-doublehockeysticks and suicide but its really funny five bowl hair cuts out of five like smosh would say :)
__label__1 DO NOT PRESS THE RED BUTTON!!!!!!#!!!!#!!!! This app is so funny I laugh every time I play it. Funny when it say the world will EXPLODE!!!!!!!!!!!!$$!!!!!! So hilarious and annoying to the text saying the stuff. Hi there. I wish I could do the stuff that
__label__0 This app isn't worth more an 10 minutes of your time. Since it only has one storyline, it gets boaring really fast after the second time around. Trust me, unless your someone who likes reading the same story over and over and over again, then this app is
__label__1 love this game it just make have a smile on your face when your down or something this is one of he best
__label__1 I had found this on the computer and thought it was funny so I was soooo happy when I found this app. Its a little glitched but that's just because the buttons in the wrong place.
__label__1 Tjis spp is AWESOME it is a GREAT time killer! Fun for a WHILE untiil you remember what comes next. lol
__label__1 I love this game. It keeps me entertained. My cousin has this app on her iPad and I was laughing the whole time.Those of you that are &quot;concerned&quot; about this game telling you you're going to go to hell don't be. Kids hear &amp; say worse at scho
__label__0 hi I'm 6 years old I got this game on my moms kindle and I guess she played it and it told her the world was going to explode and she would go to the ground
__label__0 this app is pointless and not good. it was fun at first, but then it just got boring. DO NOT GET THIS APP!!!!!!!!!!!!
__label__0 this game isn't worth anyones time, its so lame and a waste of my time.  I had the app for 5 minutes and then after I was finished, I deleted it.
__label__1 I could not stop laughing you should totally get this app its amazing some people say its stupid but its awesome
__label__0 all you do is press the red butternut that is right in front of your face. Don't download. this app just says bad things about you.
__label__0 I liked the game for like 5 minutes and then the whole thing started over so I just deleted it.
__label__1 i dont know what will happen, it says not to press the button.  it is pretty though. i just dont want to blow up the world or something with a simple push of a button so i will just look at it.
__label__0 this app is so stupid all u do is read saying that the red button is saying its really boring don't get this App its a load of crap and a waste of space
__label__1 it is soo funny it makes me entertained but then again I'm one of those people who is easily entertained! if you are one of those people you will absolutely love it......its like the button has its own personality!!!! I love it!!!!!!!
__label__1 I love this app. I have read both stories and they are so funny. I just dont see how this is an infamous app. I laughed my head off the entire time. If you do not like this app then u must not have a sense of humor because this is funny. If you haven't d
__label__0 Don't get it.  All you do is push a red bottom and it says something you have to read. Dumb!!!!!!!!!!!!'!!!!!!!!!!!
__label__1 It is meant to be funny. It is meant to be stupid. If you got it, and read the description, it does what it says. GET IT.
__label__0 they updated this app and added obnoxious advertising.  Not cool, was a cool little mindless bit of entertainment.  No just a useless ad.  Uninstalled.  Don't bother downloading.
__label__1 This app is hilarious! It reminds me of GLaDOS from the Portal games! I highly recommend it to anyone who loves nonsensical humor.
__label__0 this app is terrible!  I hate it I thought it was funny at first but after a few rounds I got bored! do not download! this app is CRAPPY!
__label__1 I touched the red button! It is awesome! Download! Also if you like this game you should download happy poo jump free!
__label__0 Do not get this app!!!!! it is the worst app ever!! I do not like it!! nothing is going to happen!!
__label__0 this game sucks all u do is press da red button nd Nutin happens .DONT GET this CrAP It SUCKS unless all u wanna do.is press da red button forever :/blahh dnt get plz

__label__1 incontinent see how youbleople are so mad I'm strong christen and I'm not offended its just a game have fun with it
__label__1 This is great silly fun. Everyone that I show it to pushes the red button, lol.  My husband thought it was funny, also.
__label__1 I love love love this app!!!!!!! Its great on my kindle fire. Its soliloquy funny watching my friends do this. :)
__label__1 I love this game it rocks Omb it is really awesome I have played it on my friends phone and Omb it like totally rocks I really never have time to download anything so now is my awesome break for thanksgiving this game os awesome yeah
__label__0 this game is stupid and really bad words in it that is not a fun game at do not get it and it is horrible to that is and if you other people like this good for u and I hope you are having a good time stupids
__label__1 if you are bord press the red buutton. I am was bord &amp; my ferend cam over she sode me the red button
__label__1 this app is stupid weird funny get it its free and time cunsuming what will the button say/ do next??????
__label__0 I did not purchase this app because I do not want to waste my space, so I read comments looked at pictures and decided not to get it. A little tip not to waste so much space, red and look at pictures for a good 5 minutes. oh and also comments help too.
__label__1 this is kinds scaring me especially where they say after the world will go boom I'm scared and like its saying that I'm dead
__label__1 Absolutely hilarious...once you start you just "gotta" keep it going. Otherwise you will keep wondering what that next sentance was going to be. I haven't purchased either of the choices given for a new story or visual app. I will be doing so after the R
__label__1 Funny. Clever. Worth the price (free). Can't get laughs any cheaper than this. Did I mention it was unique? Play it.
__label__0 very stupid. it has no point. u hit a red button. the red button does nothing. its pointless. I would not get this app. Ever.
__label__0 Im not saying it's not funny, but it gets really boring. after you go through it once, the jokes get repetitive and i uninstalled it. not recommended.
__label__1 I like it. All you people offended by this app, jeez. As someone said earlier, it's meant for people with a sense of humor. Besides, it said DON'T PRESS THE RED BUTTON. Your fault.
__label__0 I still don't see why there's only one gun, the Desert Eagle. I mean its ok, but there has to be more variation between the choice of guns...
__label__0 Well I thought this would have more to it than what I got. Anything to sell. People will try it.
__label__0 this app is not good it only has one choice for a gun and the gun sounds fake and it doesnt even jerk back as if it has kick don't reccemond
__label__1 It's awesome! Thanks to this, I can kill without ammo! (but I still have to reload). Pow pow pow pow!
__label__0 it's just makes noise, nothing special, kinda sounds like a gun. It goes bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang!
__label__0 despite the other bad reviews, i decided to try it because I really love the concept. still love the concept but it's not responsive to the touch at all which makes it very frustrating and unplayable. By the way, "it's free so don't complain" is not help
__label__0 Ugh, I hate to do this but it's time for me to be one of those FAotD bums and rate this game without even playing it. It looks okay at best but what's with the misspelled name? If you're not going to bother spelling it right then in not going to bother t
__label__1 this is a cute simple game that involves swiping and quick reflexes.The graphics are top notch and the theme is consistent. at least on my phone. I have no idea how this will fare on a tablet. I thought the animation of the monsters flying around was hil
__label__0 After playing this app for 1 min I became extremely bored with it. All you do if flick monsters into the corners of the screen.
__label__0 I would like to give this a higher rating, but its virtually unplayable on my Droid incredible. It often does not read my touch and thus I can't even pass the first level. I've never had an app north read my touch before, so- 1 Star.
__label__1 To off set some of the idiot reviews i will put my two cents in. This app is as advertised, simple matching app. playing or on an EVO 4G, work no problems.
__label__0 Game doesn't work.  Doesn't register most touches.  Crap crap crap crap crap crap crap crap crap crap crap.  Droid Incredible
__label__1 The flicking works great on a tablet.  The reviews about poor touch response makes me think this game was designed with tablets in mind (optimized for tablets), and probably not teted much on phones. I can only review this from my tablet experience, and 
__label__0 for the 5 seat review below please don't insult us. we can clearly see you are the developer..the controls and touch sensitivity is down right uncontrollable. not even worth a free download. Amazon must choose things at random cause clearly no one pre pl
__label__0 This game is simple and might have been entertaining for my 2 year old daughter to learn colors and such but the flick control is just too inconsistent.  Like other reviewers I found it to work only 1/3rd the time making the game unplayable.  Even if the
__label__0 I was hoping this game would install, I'd seen other reviews saying it wasn't optimus compatible - they're right. All I get is a reboot when trying to install.Just wanted to warn fellow optimus users, steer clear of this app.
__label__0 Will not install on LG Optimus! I tried a couple times it just resets my phone. Saw another review about the optimus but figured I'd try no good.
__label__0 I could not get this to work very well on my phone.  It had a very hard time registering swipes (Galaxy S) making it impossible to beat even just the first round of play.
__label__0 a nice idea but the problem is that when u try to tap the monsters they dont always move so u lose the alotted time the game gives u.
__label__1 it is a fun game and deserves at least a 3 from all............i will recommend itGame is HD and controls are fine on my tablet.
__label__1 I'm giving this five stars just because the dev didn't review his or her own app. it has been a nasty trend recently.
__label__0 Agree with the other reviewers - unresponsive controls, couldn't seem to track my swipes, and as far as I could tell no SD support.  Uninstalled.
__label__0 This game is frustrating and the controls are slow and unresponsive. This should be removed until the developer redevelop the game. HTC sensation
__label__1 Graphics are nice. Works real well on my HTC Thunderbolt. Good overall game. Should be 99&cent; when not free though.
__label__0 one of those 5 stars was supposed to be a 1 star, trust me i read it :p  besides that it looks like the dev even rated the game SHAME  i cant offset 2 5 stars but i can do the one
__label__1 i'm giving this game 1 star because from the looks of the pictures of the game it really looks like I could have made a better game why dont you chose the faotd more carefully next time amazon
__label__1 This game is cute, addictive and fun. It'll be fun to play on a short break or while waiting in line. I have had no issues on my Nook; the touch response is just fine. Seems like phones are having problems with this app. Yours might work just fine so it'
__label__0 This game is unplayable at any price. The controls are horrible and it lags and crashes constantly. Also, it is huge for what it is (over 15mb?? sheesh!) which leads me to believe that it is unoptimized and badly programmed. That could explain the insane
__label__0 THE RELEASE DATE FOR THIS GAME WAS 6 MONTHS AGO. THE ONLY REVIEWS FOR IT ARE PUBLISHED TODAY.? WHAT DOES THAT TELL YOU.
__label__0 the idiot voting 5 stars who isn't actually rating the game. good day sir.  I don't like the game.  is this enough
__label__0 This might be fine if this is the type of Sodoku you are looking for, but it wasn't for me.  I only rated it low for that reason.
__label__1 This sudoku app is very easy to use. I love playing it on my Kindle. I would recommend it to anyone wanting to play Sudoku as its got several levels to choose from
__label__0 Just don't like it. better games available. prefer Sudoku's that won't put the wrong # in the space. don't like it.
__label__1 Have just started to play sudoku and this helps you get the hang of it.  Like that I can put in possible numbers.  Would recommend it to beginners.  Have not tries higher levels bt do look forward to them
__label__1 My mom is 77 yrs. young and has watched her children, grandchidren, & great grandchildren use all kinds of tablets & iPads, always asking, &#34;Why are you always on that thing...?&#34;  Well I bought her a Kindle Fire and guess who absolutely loves it..
__label__1 loved it. so cool. fun for all ages. this coming from a 10 year old!? sudoko power.remember get this app!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! :-)
__label__1 Dear Friends,I love Sudoku, and I love this app. Simple and easy to use. Some others are to involved and crowded. This is just a simple, wonderful, and fun app. I use it on my Kindle and it works wonderfully. I highly recommend this app.
__label__1 I love doing these puzzles and I am glad I found one for my kindle. It is easy and fun to do!
__label__1 I'm hooked on Sudoku! Electronic versions are so much easier to play as one does not have to pencil in the possibles, then erase to put in the answers.
__label__1 Within 30 seconds I was watching YouTube videos on my TV controlled by this app on my tablet.  Fascinating.  App found the Xbox automatically no in pouts required.  I am writing this review while app is playing videos on TV.
__label__1 works with both my first gen fire and my fire hd. You don't need to have a facebook account -just skip that step. It works great withm my Sony streaming video box!
__label__1 The Application works great. It found my DLNA enabled Sony Blue Ray player in seconds and I was playing a movie right away.  Definitely worth getting.
__label__0 I PURCHASED THIS HORRENDOUS APP IN JAN. 2013, for kindle fire he. I waited 10 . MINS. FOR THIS STUPID APP TO OPEN UP. NOTHING. TRIED THREE MORE TIMES, STILL NOTHING. IT WILL NOT OPEN UP ON KINDLE FIRE PERIOD. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME.
__label__0 Even with there so called, &#34;updates&#34;, don't waste your time. It has Utube as one of its options, and you can get Utube to work fine with there own &#34;to your TV&#34; link, that are on most Blu-Ray players, to your tablet, so, forget this, unles
__label__0 I don't use facebook so how am I supposed to use this?  No, I don't need and won't sign up for facebook.
__label__1 I enjoyed the flexibility and functionality that this app allowed for. Beams youtube flawlessly from my android phone to my apple tv.
__label__1 I connected this with my Xbox with no problem. I had no problem skipping the Facebook login either. So I don't understand why there are such low ratings. Thanks for a great faotd.
__label__1 I got this when it was free and I haven't gotten the chance to use it yet but it looks pretty cool.
__label__0 I just wanted to tell the developer in a public forum how ridiculous you're app is. I literally laughed out loud when I went into the section with my videos &amp; saw that the 1st 5 vids had the exact same thumbnail nail &amp; then a correct thumbnail wi
__label__0 The description says this app can be used &quot;any time, any place, any screen&quot;  &quot;wherever you happen to be.&quot; Turns out you need a tv that's hooked up to the internet. That's a little misleading, if you ask me.
__label__0 this one is over rated and did not work so well with my kindle fire..better luck next time other devices may work better
__label__1 IMediaShare is a really great app I highly recommend it for anyone who has a smartphone and a HDTV. I do not have a tablet so I do not know if it would be able to connect through. I give this app 5 stars because how easily it can connect with my HDTV fro
__label__1 imediashare is the best app ever!!  I use it on my kindle fire and it works really good on apple TV!  No problems!!!
__label__0 I picked this up when it was the free app of the day.  It is supposed to let you watch your video on your TV without requiring any wiring.  As far as I can tell, it doesn't do anything at all.
__label__0 Lame, lame, lame! &quot;Connect anytime to any tv, no wires needed&quot;... yea only if you have wireless internet, and a compatible tv! This app is virtually useless, specially since 90% of smart phones come preinstalled with dlna software.. BOO, uninst
__label__1 Found my tv easily, pretty easy to use.  Click the video / pic button and the tv auto switches to play it.  Works as advertised.
__label__1 I've tried the free DLNA media streaming applications for android, and have been generally disappointed in them. This one (got as FAoD) is definitely one of the better ones. It was easier to configure and get running than most, and has more features. The
__label__0 I can't stand all this iCrap and that iStuff.  Let's put it away and never use it again, OK?  Thanks!
__label__0 when I got this I was like oh I get to watch my favorite shows.  but I can't play videos on this app.
__label__0 Having used this on a Kindle Fire, I can say it is nearly pointless. I have yet to be able to stream anything to a DLNA TV, whereas an existing Sony SMP-N100 can stream wireless with ease.
__label__1 New Flipps update!!. Everything now works perfect finally!!. You need a new cable tv that shows up on your router "If you want to beam shows to your tv". We just use the Kindle Fire gen1 instead of sending it to the tv of the future that we don't have ye
__label__0 Spinning circle forever.  Connected to internet.  Left it go for an hour.  nothing changed.  deleted and reinstalled.  demo played. back to spinning forever.  deleted forever.
__label__1 I recommend this for everyone!If your looking for a great app to share your videos/music/pics with your tv it's simple and easy with this app!
__label__0 This app contains the Facebook Like Exploit.  It forces you to advertise for the developers who lack the skills or talent to market in traditional ways.  They take advantage of their own customers and exploit their Facebook account.
__label__1 Works incredibly well. No Facebook login needed just press skip. Great picture quality. Does require hardware, smart TV, console or other network connected box.
__label__1 I am able to stream my personal videos to my Tv via my xbox 360. The dev releases frequent updates. The selection of channels to watch is excellent and growing. if you do not have a rokubox or similiar device I highly recommend this. Oh sometimes the new
__label__0 Don't remember having this.one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen to fulfill required number of words.
__label__0 If you have the right devices at home, TV., Media box, video game console, then this would work but if you don't then don't bother.
__label__0 Didn't work with my TV, as it didn't see it.I didn't log into Facebook and I couldn't see internet videos, I couldn't,I see my TV either. This is a paid app, asking me to like it or link it to my Facebook account is wrong.  You should pay me to advertise
__label__1 I have read some of the reviews and i don't understand why some people can't see the option to skip the Facebook login. This app works great with my Galaxy Nexus and Vizio Co-Star Google TV,it would be nice if it was compatible with more Google TV device
__label__0 I was interested in this product to see what it was.  I not sure that I could use this item at this time.
__label__0 I have heard this thing is really hit and miss. If it works on your tv, you will love it. I never got it to work myself.
__label__0 not sure where I got this and I hope I did not pay for it. not sure where I got this and I hope I did not pay for it
__label__1 Really easy to use and connect to my ps3 and watch all the movies in the internet in U-tube or your tablet still have to discover more about of this app but so far really happy with it.
__label__1 Ok, I have had this app for about a month since it was the faotd. It has quickly become my favorite app. My projector at home and the big screen at work both have xbox's hooked up to them so I use this app to watch movies on my phone on those devices. I 
__label__0 I have zero spam (ad networks) on my Nexus 7 and ANY app that installs any of that junk gets removed with a quickness.
__label__0 But it never gets passed the buffering message. I thought it was going smoothly, found movies to watch, and phone photos, but nothing works.
__label__0 I have an android phone with Allshare (samsung galaxy S2) and I have Verizon fios which allows me to access the internet on my tv, but this app still did NOT Work on my tv and I don't know why.  According to the description, this app is supposed to work 
__label__0 It was too difficult to figure out how to make it work. It isn't user friendly at all. Don't want to take the time to figure it out!
__label__1 I must admit, This application is nifty for viewing DLNA shares on your local network either on your tablet or you can push the video to a compatible TV or streaming media devices connected to your TV. But what caught my attention was the ability to view
__label__0 I couldn't even try this app. Tried using it on my Kindle Fire with no good result. It just stays on the loading screen. I have uninstalled and reinstalled but to no avail. If I paid for this I would have been very upset. Purchasing this app should be av
__label__1 This app is a great free app of the day. I can't believe that amazon would offer it free. I think you should get it before it's too late you won't regret it.
__label__0 Great concept, horrible lag and crash issues. I don't suggest paying. Rather you should try the light version and see if it preforms for you.
__label__1 With all the wonderful apps they have, this app is wonderful and is instantly by far the best app that doesn't require to be logged into to view or to share, like other apps. We have had a lot of fun sharing our video's with friends and family. This app 
__label__0 Takes over media playback, makes itself the default. (Very undeservedly self-important!) Just became a total PITA to have on the phone. UNINSTALLED!
__label__0 I didnt' even know that I had purchased or downloaded this app so must not be very useful to me
__label__0 After I ordered it it didn't understand what it was for. It wasn't. Explained that I comprehends it or what it was to be used for
__label__1 All of you whining about this must have missed the Skip button.  I chose to skip the FB login and the application is working fine.  Working well with my Mezzmo dlna server.
__label__0 My phone and tablet already have this functionality that works really good, I don't see the need for an app like this one, also, there are better apps out there that are free. The channels are limited to clips, it sucks, it doesn't have anything good to 
__label__0 Just doesn't work. When I try to use the app it does nothing. I have a Motorola xoom running jelly bean.
__label__0 I got this thankfully for free today as I will explain below why I think this app is way overpriced at $4.99.I am just going to get to the point here.  This app will NOT work with any TVs that don't have any type of Internet connectivity unless you happe
__label__0 I used the original version of this, &#34;iMediaShare&#34; as a DLNA video sender before they changed the name to Flipps HD.  One day I received an update and noticed the name had changed from iMediaShare to Flipps but this wasn't the only change.  Now F
__label__0 This app needs to be taken off the app market, it does not do anything, but not connect to anything useful.  It's something that does not have a function, just takes up space on your memory cards.
__label__1 Google market place. You pretty much need this if you have android. Get it!All the apps, all the games, all the stuff you want.
__label__1 MY tablet came with this app and it was so good that my son had to get it for his tablet also..

__label__0 why do these rating reviews INSIST on making you give at least one star? They should allow you to be completely honest. I have no reason to spare the creator of this stupid app. Do not install!
__label__0 me and my friend wanted to record something and it repeatedly said unable to record well the kindle has no speaker so what fool would make this and waste five minutes of everybodys life. I get it its really for five year oles but no five yr. old is gonna

__label__0 this app is stupid if I could rate it below a zero I would it doesn't do anything just sits there and follows your finger so if your thinking of getting it DONT
__label__0 this app is not stellar for the kindle fire. it doesn't speak beacause the fire doesn't have a good enough speaker to pick up your voice. I downloaded this app ignoring, the reviews but this app is not for kindle fire.P.S. I love my kindle fire and there

__label__1 Perhaps the Progimax office is located near the editorial offices of &#34;High Times&#34;?  Although I guess they wouldn't be able to program very well all baked.  Still, their apps remind me of my younger, higher, days.
__label__0 sucks, plz don't get this app. totally wrong. no matter what I said, it gave me 87%. plz, plz, plz don't get this app
__label__1 it so super true and I'm so glad i got this game its awesome I hope u get it. by Allison
__label__1 I love this app I mean the boyfriend I had, was nothing like me.Then I bought this app I fir it with my friend and now were dating.I LOVE THIS APP. I mean everyone should find true love, and this app is just a helper.
__label__1 This app is really neat. It is sooo cute. It is different. It is really cool. I highly recommend this app.
__label__0 Sorry but I thought this app was really stupid I mean it is fun and all to see how you and your crush might work out but also its kinda stupid and its not even true about what it says. For me it just took up space in my kindle fire.
__label__0 this app sucks I tried it on my boyfriend it gave us a 10% I mean come on we love each other lots we got really mad don't get this app
__label__0 ...but my device is a little odd (a Nook Color running a version of the Android operating system (CM7)).  The app starts, displays the splash screen, displays "Loading..." and quits.  Rebooted, same behavior.  Oh well, onward and upward.
__label__0 Would love to play as I'm running a fully rooted Nook Tablet 16g Honeycomb. Seams even I can not get past the splash screen it says loading then it reboots..... epic fail for me. I will try at a later date for updates from developer and attempt install a
__label__0 Wow what  a poor excuse for a game. To have this game listed next to pinball arcade is a sin. Glichy and poor physics. Waste of time how this was approved by amazon is beyond me.
__label__0 this app stinks the sound are fake and there are no police fire or ambulance!  don't get this app it stinks!
__label__1 what more can be said download it play it if you don't like it erase it (got to love free things). can't figure out where you would need this lol
__label__1 It sounds just like a real siren! I love it! (I pranked my mom and she went crazy.) THANK YOU FOR THIS APP!!!! :)
__label__0 I will never purchase one of your apps again this app will not let me create a contact delete a contact and u don't even wanna no more don't buy this app gosh very shameful hate this that's 3$ thrown away
__label__0 I usually download the free app everyday, even if it is one I really don't need at the moment.  I refuse to even do that for this app.  I am not spooked by permissions that are needed for 90% of the apps out there but this one scares me.  I realize that 
__label__1 Had iOS on my iPod touch and I've been waiting for an app like this to come out foot Android. There was an app like this on the market called POPtext, which could utilize my Textplus account. But that was crap. I mean the interface was terrible, the load
__label__1 This app is great and works well on my nookcolor. People please review the app itself and not just whether or not it works well for your carrier/data plan. This is a great alternative for people with tablets, iPads, and ipod touches. Doesn't deserve the 
__label__0 This would be a five star app IF it worked properly. I have the new Kindle Fire HD and even though I have it set up in my settings to make a sound when texted it does NOT...I tried all the different sound files they offer. I tried shutting the Kindle com
__label__0 If you have a kindle fire hd and want to make phone calls, like me, do not spend your money. It does exactly the same as the free version would do, even here they make it more complicated.
__label__1 Awesome app, I&apos;m able to txt from my acer iconia tab a500, and a spare htc hd2 using wifi!As for the people that rated this app a low score because they lack the understanding to see how to benefit from having this app, and it was free when they got
__label__1 I rarely have my mobile phone with me, but my tablet is attached to my hip.  Being able to text from my tablet is a huge time and stress saver.  I love this app
__label__0 Can't for the life of me figure out why anyone would need this.  I don't even believe that there was a plan that included data that didn't included unlimited texts at my last two carriers.
__label__1 it would help if u made it app of the day for free please I really want it please can u do that I would love to have it my sister has it and she loves it
__label__1 I recommend you get this app it works great on my Kindle Fire and allows me to text my friends just about anywhere!!! The best part is that its free so you can no longer worry about buying pre-paid minutes
__label__1 This is a fantastic app.  Most of those that are not happy with the app did not read the description of the app carefully.  This app does everything it says it does. And the texts are free! I love it!
__label__1 Let me begin by responding to the negative comments:There may be various reasons why many people would find this application useful. If you have an unlimited text messaging plan on your phone (as most do) great. Don't download and poorly rate the app bec
__label__1 I love the interaction with my contacts on my tablet. My tablet doesn't have cell, but I can text away and get answers when I connect to a network.And support is 5 star.I can think of only 1 improvement: When you enter a number of someone not in your con
__label__1 This app is an absolute must have for tablets.  If you're like me, you've probably been frustrated at the fact your Xoom or other device can't send a simple text message.  Well now you can!  And without having to pay per message fees or for expensive bun
__label__1 the messages pop up of i am not on the app but it is still incredible. dont listen to the bad comments!!!!!!!
__label__1 this is just what i was looking for. i am surprised at the poor ratings by kids whose parents are paying 20 bux a month for unlimited sms. well even for them this is a useful app, here's how: you can use this app using a wifi connection to send free sms 
__label__1 This app is good not great,,  if google voice is better than why give it a negative review when it does the same thing.  Give negative reviews for something thats wrong with it.
__label__1 The app is the best app I have. The only problem is that you can't walkie talky on the kindle fire/ kindle fire HD.
__label__0 Not only is this worthless with unlimited texting but you are giving them access to all your information for all of your contacts AND all of your text messages are stored on their servers.  Just avoid it.  I wish I could remove it from my download list a
__label__0 I thought it was going to let me integrate my own phone number and get my messages on my kindle.  I was mistaken and lost a bit of dough.  I found another app that did what I needed.
__label__1 Some places get no signal but have WiFi available which makes this app great. Or if you have limited text messaging plan.
__label__0 Not free.  Must pay fee to use texting. Sending it back.  No way to get my money back?  Probably not.
__label__0 I have had this app now for some time. now and change my views on it. The free one was SOOOOOOOO much better. WHY? Because with this one I have all these strange numbers that text me in the middle of reading a book are just to much.  Now, I am not sure t
__label__1 This app is perfect! I have a phone, unlimited texting. Buut I do leave my phone in my room and take my kindle fire HD around the house. So I be lazy to get my phone. So I got this app to text on my kindle fire HD lol yes yes I'm lazy. The good thing abo
__label__1 this app in general delivers what it claims however it freezes up at least once a day for hours on end and makes text a pain. you have to force stop uninstall reinstall i regret payin 2.99 for this..i must update my review! ok its ben a month since my fi
__label__1 this app off the chain and it alerted you when you get a text,this is really great on Kindle Fire......get it NOW
__label__0 Ever heard of google voice? More flexibility and free and you can use from your computer and integrate phone service if you are tech savvy. This is just dumb to pay for. Even free it makes no sense.
__label__0 With so many truely free alternatives, why bother with this app? Heck... If you own an app device and don't already have unlimited texting then something is wrong with you. This app just isn't even worth my time.
__label__1 I don't do texting on my phone and always had to email my daughter to her phone.  With this app on my Kindle Fire HDX 8.9, I can text her anytime and she receives it right away.  I don't have to wait for her to text back while playing games or reading a 
__label__1 First off, the app does exactly what it says if you read the description. It says you have to register for an account and you are giving a "texting phone number" right in the description. This is similar to Google Voice except without the voice. Another 
__label__0 I cant for the life of me figure out why there is an app for this... Who has an Android whithout unlimited text? Im on Verizon and have unlimited.  I mean even the small carriers like Cricket and Mobi are unlimited... Amazon, I'm disappointed. Out of all
__label__0 What is a lifeline phone?  It is for someone who *qualifies* to get a free mobile phone from the US government.  Yes, that's right... check out lifeline.gov if you don't believe me.Let's recap where this app is useful:1. If you have never heard of Google
__label__1 I know I know! it does not always pop up the text! but most of the time it does so stop being a baby!
__label__0 I can't easily add or edit contacts. it seems to want to be on a smart phone which in my opinion defeats the whole purpose of me getting this, texting from my Kindle Fire. If I had a smart phone why would I need this? Fairly pointless. It does work thoug
__label__0 I know hate is a strong word but I do not like text plus at all because it felt just being too met I guess
__label__0 I didn't buy this but I saw it a read the description and looked at the pictures. and then I reliezed...his iz this different from the free version. (that I have) They seem exactly the same 2 me.
__label__1 This app is great -- especially when you can't or don't want to pay for unlimited messages! I have friends on AT&amp;T and since they aren't included on my plan, those people use my number for textPlus gold. Then it doesn't use up my allowance for texts 
__label__0 it is tarrible.its a waste of money.does not get pics from people.I just hate it.my mom sent me a pic but I did not get it it not gold its dull
__label__1 I can't afford a phone so I got this and it realy is like a phone. It is realy easy to use and this is the only texting app I have found that doesn't ask for a phone number. :&middot;)Me and my sister both have this app now a lot of my family has this ap
__label__0 I dont have the app, BUT.......Do not waste ur money on this. this is the same app as the original one, except u pay 4 it and u can add voice messages. u don't need voice messages. if u do, then wat is a phone for? The original one is good enough. DO NOT
__label__1 I love this app!when I don't feel like getting my phone I can pick up my Kindle Fire and &quot;boom!&quot; its right there! great idea whoever came up with it!
__label__1 this app does just what it says.  there are zero hidden or misleading information. you have to register(big deal) takes 40 seconds to compete.  you then get your own virtual phone number in which you can text anyone and they can text you back.  they DO N
__label__0 I got this app thinking I could revive pictures and send voice messages.....No! The only way you can do that is if the person you are texting has the app....none of my friends do! Get the free one it is way better!!!! It is a good thing I used amazon coi
__label__0 This may be the worst app ever made.  Lag crashes it has it all. This ago does nothing good for my phone. I have a mesmerize with froyo, my advice is to pass on this app.
__label__1 I love that I get a text on my kindle, android phone and iPod. No matter what I'm using, I can respond immediately. Thanks
__label__1 This app is the best texting app ever! It's amazing on the Kindle fire. I could text anyone! Unlimited texting... AWESOME!!! My family and friends love it! The only thing is, I wish the kindle fire had a mic and camera, so I could take pics and use the w

__label__1 I don't text on my phone at all, but this app helps me to text safely and get info to those I want to keep up with.
__label__1 i just love this app.. now i can use my tablet for sending text messages but the only problem is the notification sound and notification on the notification bar is not working cos gtablet doesnt have a built in text messaging app.. i guess those features
__label__1 I think this is a great app. It texts fine and works great. Ive seen other reviews starring it doesn't work great and isn't that good. It worked great for me and I'm not saying others are wrong. I'm mist starring my opinion and how well this app worked f
__label__1 the only problem is it still force closes. if it didn't force close. I would be much happier with this. and we also want SILVER!
__label__1 This works great on my kindle. I have unlimited text on my phone, and now on my kindle fire too.
__label__1 With the new update, this app just got so much better. Push notifications now work correctly and the application doesn't lag one bit. The speed is incredible. A must have for tablet owners.
__label__1 I use it on my Android device and I have used it close to two months.  It seems to be a good product and I haven't had any issues yet.The only thing I don't like about it is sometimes it says I have to been signed into my Amazon account. This is just an 
__label__1 this is hands down the BEST texting app available! I have SMS on my phone but sometimes when I am parked in my recliner and don't want to get up and get my phone I just text right from my Kindle Fire HDX. Buy this app, you won't be disappointed!
__label__1 I have a kindle fire. I used to have text plus but now with text plus gold it doesn't frees every time I want to get in it. 5 stars!!!!!!!
__label__1 this app is great but I don't see the difference from the free one and paid one? but still, its awesome! go free txting
__label__0 this is a poor application if you are interested in just a sms application and not the rest of the so called features.
__label__1 I recently moved to an area that has ZERO cell service so we got rid of the cell phones and just lived with the home phone but long distance calls were getting expensive so I started looking for other options and skype worked for some of my friends/famil
__label__1 I love being able to text from my Kindle Fire HDX . It's so convenient because I'm almost always on it anyway and it's much easier to text from the Kindle keyboard than on the cell phone. And you can text pictures, too.
__label__0 I bought this thinking it was better than the free version..WRONG. I don't know when people text me. do not get this....its a wast of money....don't even get the free version
__label__1 I love it. It is a great app that lets you be social with all your friends and is totally free. It's a wonderful app and i completely love it
__label__1 I didn't know that I could text on my kindle fire until I was browsing thru the apps. I am very happy with my text +
__label__0 This whole &quot;new number for texting&quot; is silly. Whatsapp is far superior for unlimited texting between smart phones.Even if you get it for free today, you really want to go and bother everyone in your phone book to text you at this number and cal
__label__1 this app is great. especially if all ur friends have texting on their phones and you don't. its cheap (as in cost) , you only have to pay once, and its really nice to talk to family and friends that you don't see enough. I love this app and recommend it 
__label__1 I love this app. I have Kindle Fire 2 gen. I got the pro so I don't have ads. But the free was great too. I am able to text all of my friends and family. As long as I have WiFi I am great :-)
__label__0 thoese ppl w/ the one star reviews are right! its the exact same thing as the free version but u had to pay for it. i think the speaker thing for kindles and tablets would work if u hav headphones w/ a built in mic but its just a ripoff!!
__label__0 it is impossible to call people or do voice notes if it is a kindle fore ur using because it doesnt have a mic!
__label__1 This app is great!! It lets me text people even though I can't use my phone. Yeah I can't receive pictures from people but I don't really care about that. It's free unlimited texting to anyone in the US and Canada and it helps me keep in touch with peopl
__label__1 I do not have Texting on my phone so when I found this APP works great with my Kindle fire HD and I can text using Kindle
__label__1 so you know how people say it crashes? mine crashed for a while too but I found out it was my stupid Internet connection had caused a virus in my kindle fire. if that's not the case with yours then sorry that your missing out on a great texting app.
__label__1 So I heard this is a great app for people who dont have unlimited text messaging. That's great :) I have a question though... do you need a new number or can you keep the one you have in your phone????
__label__0 The number you are supplied with is only a trial number, then you have to pay to have another number. i don't recommend this app.
__label__1 I have and use Text + free on my Samsung Galaxy Tab 7", which by the way has both 3G and WiFi, which is why I got it and not the 10" that is WiFi only.  This review isn't about my Galaxy Tab, or the iPad and its variants.  This review is about an app tha
__label__0 This app is excellent!  Even though there are limitations, it's better than having to pay for texting on your cell phone.  I had the free version, and upgraded to this version to find out what the difference was between the free and the gold (other than 
__label__1 Dudes, (and dudets) this is the best texting app you could get from amazon. I would buy right away. u can text with one person or as many people as u like!  I love text plus and text plus gold. however, it says limited texting on the regular text plus bu
__label__0 I tried both text and text gold. There is no difference in the two, they are both very bad. Hard to use and it does not do anything like it says it will. This is a very bad program, amazon should not sell it to their customers.
__label__1 This has been so handy to text from my Kindle when my phone is otherwise occupied or dead. It has kept me from missing messages when I'm engrossed in something on my Kindle. I have had to reinstall a few times due to glitches or freezing but it always wo
__label__0 This app doesn't connect w/  texting systems. the &quot;phone number&quot; is not real: doesn't connect with other numbers. Not even email-cnctd! (all text systems can connect to email which is an alternative for ipod/xoom users)So what is it? A lame att
__label__0 So can you text without wifi?? and what's the difference between text plus and text plus gold? I have heard its a good app but was wondering if it is better than text plus
__label__1 my parents wont let me have a phone so this is a great way to tale to my friends. I love it
__label__0 I'm really mad. I payed $1.99 to take off ads, cause that's what's different. I tried to receive pictures and I can't. Takes a lot time to load. And always, forces to close and then I have to open it again. You have  limit to how many words you can send.
__label__0 I found out with the appstore update and being logged out that this app only works if you are logged into appstore.  It calls home to authenticate itself.  Not good.  Where else does it call that you do not know
__label__0 Everyone I know has free texting.  This app must be for prepaid phone's. lol Amazon! Today's app is junk, Will pass on this one.
__label__0 This App Says Get Free! Texting But U Have To Pay For Every Text U Write.Give Us Text Now It Should not Just Be For IPods
__label__1 I have the free version of this on my Droid X because my son has an iPod Touch. This let's me text with him since I can't call him on that device. For those with wifi only devices like a tablet this app is a nice alternative. Especially if you don't have
__label__1 I already paid for a data plan on my phone but not a text program. This software saved me money by letting me send texts. Some people are confused by the fact that my phone calls and texts come from different numbers.
__label__1 yea so im 12 &amp; i have a kindle fire but i do not have a cell phone. so i got this app and now i can txt all of my ffriends thank u text plus ppl!!! :)
__label__1 Use it alot buy I wish you got more free minutes to make phone calls when phone is down
__label__0 Google voice is better.  And if Verizon is screwing you over just come to Sprint, unlimited everything for 70 bucks.
__label__0 Has anyone yet twigged to the fact that messages sent via someone else's phone number are no longer yours? That you are giving this app permission to read and store your messages? That an unscrupulous developer could eavesdrop on your messages, and even 
__label__1 Very eadsy to use app. This my main texting app.
__label__0 why would you get this for $ just get the free one the only new thing it does from the free one is voice messages
__label__0 two words: unlimited text messaging. besides there is google voice. this app is just pointless. not to mention that you need a separate number as well.
__label__0 Come on Amazon!! A free texting app? Really? Who is picking these stupid free app of the day??? Do any of you BOTHER to read what people post?? Why not pick an app WE'D like to be free?!? And for you... XOOM owners... the Galaxy Tab can text...ha ha ha h

__label__0 on the pics and stuff it shows u can revive pics and call people but that's not true its just like he first one!!!!
__label__0 one of the worst free for the day apps yet. even if you don't have unlimited texts, don't bother with this. you'll eventually be charged and it has the ability to read info you send out. doesn't sound very safe to me.unlimited text plans are pretty cheap
__label__1 I have two people I text on a regular basis.  TWO.  I do not like cell phones, because I'm a student and I seem to always forget to put the dang thing on vibrate while in class.  When a cell phone rings while you are in class, it is Not A Good Thing.  I

__label__0 I do not understand why this paid version is so out of sync with the same program available on the play store. I mean way out of date. There is absolutely no excuse for this and it is not fair to those of us who paid for the app over here just to have a

__label__0 NO, most carriers still charge outragous fees for SMS messages.  It should be free but they are printing money from SMS.Solutions? This app and google voice (always free) provide you with a number that you can recieve free messaging any time you have an

__label__1 Its is awsoume its so much better than the regular text plus and you can do so much more. SWEET!!!!!!!
__label__1 I like this app. You can be anonomous if you want. It's fast and easy to use. You can change your number, edit all your details, name location etc. Works with your contact app already installed on the kindle fire. I would like to know what the features a
__label__0 I usually like stuff like this but it was boring...I like the candle and lighter apps better! This app doesn't do anything!
__label__1 I was leary as to having this spray free, but it has been hours of entertainment for my daughter. I still have to make sure she isn't spraying a real can of something.
__label__0 there isn't anything you can do with it. the lighter one you see/toy with fire and can flip the lid but this is kind of sad.
__label__0 all u do on this app is spray a can there is no goal or point to this app its dumb. don't get this app it sucks there's no colors that come out of the can it doesn't even spray for very long never get this app cuz if u do u will delete after u try it cuz
__label__0 Dose not work good so boring I do not like it one bit not good at all bad bad bad bad
__label__1 it so much fun just downloaded. it but van anyone tell me how to change the spray Colorado thc for making this app please try more progimax apps my favorite is the lighter.
__label__1 I honestly love this app because it does what is says it would do. it is perfect in every way because it is MEANT TO BE POINTLESS!!!!!!!! Honestly people! Some of you need to learn how to spell because.... it says what it will do in the description! and 
__label__0 i dont understand why this app is in the top 100 because most of the apps there are actually good but NOT THIS ONE! ehat is even the point of it. uninstall if you have it and dont buy it waste of time
__label__0 This game SUCKS! I mean what is the purpose all you do is press a button. And when I said for it to be pink it was still WHITE!!  DO NOT GET THIS DUMB GAME!! MOVE ON AND HAVE A REAL PURPOSE IN LIFE.
__label__0 the resen I vote this a 1 because it dusint work on a kindlefire but good on the andrord and ifhone
__label__0 ok I absolutely am addicted or.obbseses which ever you prefer to lighter apps I think they are the best invention since sliced bread I always want to use that saying but this is.such a let down it.made me so mad that I shined this app and are warning all
__label__0 when I got this app I thought I would get an app that has a picture of an lighter then make a flame but instead I got an app that makes the front of my tablet white. this app is a price of crap!!!!!!!!!!
__label__0 this is a peice of poop its crap if I could I would rate it 0 stars but I have to I don't even what it is ment to be for
__label__0 I have the kindle and all this does is make a light and sound never ever get this app it is worthless
__label__0 all you do is push a button and then it makes a dumb sound.it is the most retarded thing I downloaded.
__label__1 I tell my daughter that if she wants to play on the tablet she needs to do learning games. So I downloaded this and some other money counting apps and some apps to help her tell time. This was a big hit with her. The graphics are great and they have a fe
__label__1 I got this for my 7 year old who is learning money in 2nd grade.  She loved it.  Really helped her to understand the concepts and what the coins really looked like (better than the copy of a worksheet at school).
__label__1 We enjoy using this program, especially the sorting sequence of *coin. We must use a pencil/paper to help with the calculating of coin total, but this really adds to the teaching that, &#34;Money equals/is Numbers&#34;. I am using this with my autistic s
__label__1 I fine this app to be most useful when looking for good deals every day. Try it and tell someone what you think.
__label__1 I have had AARP for about six years and I use it got a lot of things. I use it when I travel and save money on hotels, meals and car rentals. I also have their roadside assistance plan and it is much cheaper than AAA.
__label__1 just what I have been looking for and use it daily. I have been a member since I turned 50.
__label__1 I have all the aarp information at my finger tips. I love being able access topics on my kindle when I think of them.
__label__0 Downloaded app, tried to log-in, got log-in error said I was not a member. Sent email to app support, got a reply email that was a lot of legalese mumbo jumbo. Got mad and deleted.
__label__1 love all the info I receive from the app. keeping up with the current things out there for our age people is nice.
__label__1 Ok AARP where is the Kindle Fire version.i side loaded this app into the Kindle Fire and it worksgreat.
__label__0 tells me i am not an aarp member; i am. closes suddenly, all the time, randomly, without warning, loses data. junk. uninstalled. dont want it. ViewSonic gTablet.
__label__0 Unfamiliar site, difficult to maneuver! There is no sign-in available to associate directly to your account, check your preferences, or change profile.
__label__0 I am not sure why this app does not work on my Kindle Fire when the AARP Magazine and Bulletin both work fine, but I was very disappointed.  It downloaded fine but I could not get it to open.  I kept getting the message that I needed to be connected to t
__label__0 Downloaded and installed with no problem on my kindle fire. Tried to sign in and was told I was not a member. If this is not corrected this is a worthless app. Uninstalled.
__label__0 This is one of worst apps ever. Will not recognize me as a member. It should not be offered to anyone.
__label__0 This APP is a bummer, it's a lemon, it's no good! Tried several times to get into my account but kept saying I am not an AARP member. I noticed some other reviewers said the same thing. Even tried removing & downloading it again. No good. If there was a 
__label__1 If you are an AARP member and on the go then download this app. I was even able to show my AARP card to any retailer who recognizes the power behind its' membership. AAARP always seems to get it right! Kudos!
__label__0 This app has given me nothing but grief. If just freezes my cell phone. There is no loading beyond the login button. It works fine up to the login button. Avoid this one folks there's gotta be a better one coming.And tell em' you've read another review b

__label__0 don't get this game!!!!!!!!!!! its BAD like lame bad!!!idf u want one u cane really pet go on the Internet and look up foo pets. com no spaces like this foopets.com
__label__0 This game stinks! It doesn't do anything GOOD! I say don't get this, when you tap on the animal you just touch it and it meows or something like that! Frustrating to ME when I bought it, I thought, this looks funny. But noooo it HAD to be stupid like I t
__label__0 it does not do anything but say the animals name the only one that makes a sound is the kitten but not all the time. don't download
__label__0 I had gotten this app for my one year old cousin, and you touch the screen and most of the time it does nothing. Little picture options and does not keep my cousin busy. It also freezes. I reccomend not getting it!
__label__1 I WAS TOTALLY SURPRISED WHEN MY GRANDDAUGHTER TOLD ME ABOUT THE FREE GAMES OFFERED TO THE KINDLE FIRE WE PURCHASED. THEY LOVE PLAYING THEM, AND THE PET THEM ANIMAL EDITION RE-ENFORCES THEIR DESIRE FOR A PUPPY. THEIR CAT LOOKED SURPRISINGLY LIKE THE ONE O
__label__0 this game is really really really lame all u do is pet stupid animals I am only 11 and I think this worst app evr
__label__1 Aww these baby animals are so cute I'm glad I get to PER them because how would you feel in a world without pets
__label__0 I thought you would get to pet the animals and they would react!! Well they don't. They are just pictures of animals that you touch and they make a noise! DO NOT GET THIS APP!s
__label__0 Ads and more ads. The animals did nothing when you touched the screen. Even the smallest grandkids were NOT entertained, but were more annoyed than anything.
__label__0 I thought you could interact with the anamals but it only makes 1 sound every minute. I think you shouldn't get this app. It was a huge disappoint.
__label__0 who would waste their time stroking fake pets.its a waste of time.you could do much better things with your time.DO NOT GET THIS APP!!!
__label__0 this game is crap I thought it would be like fish adventure or birdland but no it sucks don't purchase it.it sucks believe me
__label__0 I thought that it would be ok even though everyone else said it sucked but it really does suck I couldn't even make the animals do anything not even make a noise!!! I recommend you don't get it!!!
__label__0 it only gives you a picture of a bear and you pet the bear it does not do any thing.Its just a dumb picture.
__label__1 I love puppies so when I found this game I was so happy to see that they had my kinds of pets
__label__0 This app is dumb. Its stupid. only shows pictures of ten animals.I would only recommend it for kindle owners with 2 year old kids, NOT adult or teenage people.
__label__0 I have a cat that is much more fun to pet than this app. stupid stupid STUPID! don't download. I'M WARNING YOU! READ THE REVIEW! DOWNLOAD AND YOU SHALL BE CURSED! BWAHHAHAHAHAHA!
__label__0 Jeez you have to agree to something of course I didn't read it cuz I'm lazy but still it came harm your divice.I don't think this is the best app.
__label__0 what the f*** is this for nobody will like it not even baby's like u stare at cute pics. while like they make a sound oh wow big deal
__label__0 it is so stupid all their is is pictures and words and it doesn't even make any sound. it is the worst game ever! I hate it. you cant even pet the animal.
__label__0 my daughter was sad. nothing to do at all. we erased it in 10 seconds. what a shame...could of beenfun
__label__0 it just a pic of an animal and it doesn't work somebody just wanted to have an app andget known for how bad it sucks!
__label__1 Very good. Great pictures of baby animals. Fun for any animal lover,any age. And its FREE! What a deal and great app!
__label__0 how do u even do this game wft is this u got to flip over cards i got the game but dot even play the dump game this for  slow people
__label__0 this is so stupid u click on the name and a voice just says it its just pic of cute furry baby animals!!  Such a rip off!!!!!
__label__0 this is the worst game in the world. navery get this game because you will reaget it .bealve me I now.
__label__0 okay,im not quite sure what to do with this app,i got it for my brother, but when you touch the animals nothing happens, not even a noise,so im confused.
__label__1 it's a nice game but i think it would be better on a tablet. with the screen size on my og droid it makes it hard to drive the fish around.
__label__1 The controls are just fine and this is a fun game for a while.  The adventure mode can be beat in an hour or two but it is certainly worth downloading.
__label__1 I got this app not exactly knowing what it was but became quite addicted to it, and its as simple as it sounds grow your fish!!, it's a simple game but still maintains a good level of challangehd2- android
__label__1 I have been waiting so long for a game like this. Survival of the fittest. Eat anything smaller than you. Get eaten by bigger creatures. Grow! Eat the bigger guys who messed with you before. It's a simple and fun concept. Spore uses it. Darwin's island m
__label__1 A great time passer.  Haven't been playing it long, but - so far - it is a cute game. Try it
__label__1 This is very similar to a Popcap game I really enjoyed on the PC, Feeding Frenzy. The more little fish you eat, the bigger you get. The bigger you get, the bigger fish you can eat.
__label__1 Great game seems dull at first, but gets better. Lots of levels with a shop to purchase upgrades. This game seems stupid at first because of the levels where they teach you how to play. Hang in there and you'll like it!
__label__0 Graphics are ok, sounds are ok.  But game was too simple so I stopped playing after just a few minutes.  When I closed the game, the sounds continued to play.  Started game again and used task manager to kill it.  Game closed, but sounds continued still.
__label__1 Great adventure game. It's awesome, fun, and time-eating. I recommend this game for anyone looking for something that requires good strategy or that has a slight challenge to it while not being too difficult. Overall I love it and would pay up to $7 for 
__label__1 I don't like 'endless' type games so I'm very glad this has levels. The menu is slightly pixelated and cheap looking, but the game is excellent. Cute and colorful,good sounds and nice controls. I prefer the joystick control but it's nice to have a choice
__label__1 I downloaded this as the FAOTD and it reminded me of a game called Osmosis I got as the FAOTD as well.  I loved that game and the fish game was quite similar but a little easier to understand since it was easy to tell bad fish rather than bad cells.
__label__1 Fun game, many levels and two different difficulties. Its addictive, I have beat the game once and am going back to play them all on Advanced.
__label__1 The &quot;most helpful reviews&quot; for this game are not helpful at all. If you read only that, you will never give a chance to the this little lovely game. It is a very good game , similar to the famous game named &quot;Helium&quot;, which I uninstall
__label__1 While the game itself is fun and cute. Most of it is used to save money and then build up your self confidence to play survival mode. And endlessly fun throw your phone at the wall and play it again kind of fun.
__label__0 Games like this have been around for a long time and, having played several versions myself, I find the effort and quality of this game rather lacking. There are many free games like this online that are much more fun.
__label__1 The goal is to eat fish smaller than yourself without being eaten along the way.  A very cute game that gradually increases in difficulty.  My 4 year old enjoys playing the easier levels and I like the more challenging ones.  I like how you can upgrade y
__label__0 Ad free?  Meh- not really .. never mind that you really can't even play this game without buying add ons. I get the premise of selling more powers in games, everyone has to make a buck but this game equates to nothing except swimming a fish around to eat
__label__1 Got this game and can't stop playing.  Fun fun fun, beat part is competing for the highest score in the online leader board.
__label__0 Had to delete it due to its lameness. Could possibly be fun for others who don't find simple things entertaining.
__label__1 This is game is simple to understand and does not need a long tutorial to figure out. Its best aspect is the desire for improvement, meaning the player always wants a bigger and faster fish. The game has an variety of powerups the player can use to catch
__label__1 simple fun power ups perfect graphics enjoyable gameplay for a good game it'll take half your battery and that's after 10 levels. happy fun.
__label__0 Have not heard of this & don't recall downloading.Did you know Amazon does this bait & switch sort of think with the discounts for applying for an Amazon card?
__label__1 This game kept me occupied for a long time. Wish there were more levels.Great game which advances through levels with a chance to set your personal performance.
__label__1 This game is fun, esp when bored and you don't want to think too much. I enjoy the different fish you have to conquer or run from.
__label__1 I was all set to hate this game based on other user reviews and when i played it... i found it fun and entertaining. I dislike joystick games so having to tilt my kindle fire isn't a problem for me like for other users. You eat other fish and earn coins 
__label__0 holy crap what a terrible game. talk about trying to ride the coattails of angry birds. the leveling system is a rip off of birds. and this game is so boring.
__label__1 While I didn't pay for the app, I got it via Blackmart/4shared, it was a great game. The adventure mode provides a real challenge, with great replay value. definitely a must!
__label__0 all you do is swim around and eat little fish, a waste of two dollars. do not buy this app!
__label__1 Over the years I've seen them add and take away different stuff, but the game is always fun and challenging. Addicting too!
__label__0 Remember back when you could go to a store and buy a computer game? They had many levels...you could play them for days...now we only get offered Apps...little peices of games filled with adds. spyware and malware. And if they dont...well wait around til
__label__0 This game is NOT free (or going to be free) of ads/IAPs. If you remember their other recent FaotD (missile defenders), that game also had no IAPs and no ads for the FaotD promotion. Now, it has both ads and IAPs.Not only this, but about 2 weeks ago I che
__label__1 it an easy past time game that is callmig. you dont have to touch your screen. you tilt your device. fun. family approved (i think that anyway).
__label__1 At first, this games controls annoyed me until I turned on the on-screen controls instead of the lame finger leader controls that  are default.  Now, this game rivals angry birds to me.  Switch your controls and give it a try.  HTC G2
__label__1 This is one of the better editing program for android. It works well and is easy to learn if your a novice.. If you previously had photo editing programs it's a cinch to master. It covers most of the retouching components.
__label__0 This is exactly what I need.  Sadly, I only learned that it won't work on my enTourage Pocket Edge AFTER I shelled out cash for it.  Running Android 2.2.1.  Wouldn't install.  (Can I have my two bucks back?)
__label__1 This app makes the tablet worth while. Just being able to resize, rotate, and color correct on the "very mobile" is GREAT! In any emergency you can clean up a shot and have it ready for whatever your need. This is an invaluable tool, and I can't beleive 
__label__1 This app lets you put apps into groups so that when you are looking for something you dont have to scan threw the 200 apps on your phone. This is a great app.
__label__0 This really does put labels on your apps.  It really does gather them into labeled files.  That is, it does that for the apps it feels like listing -- and it persistently left out a good half of mine.  Undoing everything and starting from the beginning s
__label__1 Absolutely required on my Gingerbread device which has no native folder app and even on ICS this blows the doors off the native foldering. Customizable folders with customizable icons makes the difference to this user.
__label__1 This app is extremely easy to set us and use making it easier to find the apps I need without having  to scroll through all of them looking for a particular one.
__label__1 Really like as it works as I expected. Hove to play just alittle to find all the options
__label__1 It works well and it's ad-free.  I use this app nearly every time I use my tablet.  I see the author has only one other app and it's a paid app that I don't need.  I wish he would develop more apps, even if they were paid; I think he has done good work a
__label__1 Everyone should have this one! Organized apps are a must have on any device and this one does the job.
__label__1 This app is very easy to use to organize you apps in one place so you can have them on your home screens.  I like being able to categorize my apps and have them in one icon like games, e-mail apps etc...
__label__1 I have been using this program for several months now on a variety of different Android platforms, and it has always worked.  The app is simple to use and the price (free) is wonderful.
__label__0 I didn't like the set up on it. still looking for an app organizer...just want something simple...that I can manage myself
__label__0 this stinks! not worth my time! I mean seriously pushing buttons the whole time. please stop making terrible apps! I'm begging you! its torture!  don't get this!!!!! thank goodness it was free!  I mean it.my rating.  :  (
__label__0 this game is extremely confusing and extremely frustrating !!! this app totally sucks don't waist your time and get a better app this one sucks
__label__1 I played this. it has realistic fight sounds and awesome graphics. I recommends you to get it. :) Ps.. it is awesome
__label__0 My son wanted this app, it looked ok, so I let him download it. All it is is noises that sound like hitting or punching someone. Nothing else. Frankly, we have enough violence in the world without apps that sound like violent acts. I deleted it from my d
__label__1 I REALLY LIKE THIS SITE IT REALLY KEEP ME POSTED ABOUT PEOPLE ON THIS SITE AND I WOULD TELL OTHERS ABOUT THIS SITE!
__label__1 I love it. So easy to use! On my Kindle Fire. Clear pictures &amp; can say hello on the run and get quick updates.
__label__1 CARING BRIDGE IS AN EXCELLENT WAY FOR ALL OF US TO STAY CURRENT REGARDING THE HEALTH STATUS OF A FRIEND OR RELATIVE.
__label__1 for not letting us lose touch with our friends going through with health problems..this is a great product! Use it and hopefully your friends won't have to use it during a health problem.
__label__1 great program for keeping track of my friends illness and staying in touch with him.  I am very happy with app
__label__1 I joined this website a couple of years ago when a friend of mine had cancer.  It is a great way to stay informed about the health of a friend or loved one when you don't get to see or talk to them everyday.  I was excited to find an app for it .  It is 
__label__1 CaringBridge is a wonderful place to post status updates on someone in the hospital, hospice, or struggling with issues.  It is easy to use and to administer.  Having the app on my Kindle was a big help while someone I cared about was struggling.
__label__0 Every time I try to open it on my kindle fire it ALWAYS force closes. Other than that I like the app.
__label__0 All this is, is a bunch of links to youtube videos, most of which have been taken down, because the uploads them selves violated Fox's copyright. I can hardly believe this app is actually allowed in the marketplace. It's actually getting you to pay for i
__label__0 once i got it for $.99, i got banned from YouTube pretty much right after i got it. So i had to delete the app and i wasted $.99 on it. But, wen i had it and i wasnt banned from YouTube,  i found this app very disapointing. dont waste ur time and money o
__label__0 Using this app to get to Glee videos will not work because the user has been banned from Youtube. Do not waste your money.

__label__1 i was on the fence on buying this app because of the other review and i am happy i did you just have to rember the only people who put out reviews are the people who don't like it. p.s. hope i helped u
__label__0 when I was trying to buy this app I wouldn't work don't waste your money on this app. its not worth spending it. I hope its on Ipod. I bet its better on there than it is on kindle fire. don't waste your money on this. you should read my review first.
__label__0 Reviewers should write to the app developers to fix the bugs on this app. Don't buy app. sorry DUDU Apps.
__label__1 I don't acctualy have the app but I love glee. so I might try the game out. I LOVE GLEE!
__label__0 game is ok when works, but it won't run for long.  loads slow, crashes every time you load it past level 7. uninstalled. m Droid.
__label__1 don't know what the other reviewer is on about. works wonderfully well on the 3.1 xoom tablet. the game itself has some well thought out controls which are different. require some fine timing moves. some might say controls require luck but I feel its mor
__label__0 On my Thunderbolt this program freezes my phone while trying to load Feint every time. when I shut it down it goes into an endless loop of force closes.This isn't the first time games with Feint have given me trouble. Needs to be fixed.
__label__0 Most games run great on my 10&quot; g tablet, but not this one.I always find it odd that developers spend months creating a new app but then don't take a few days at the end to thoroughly test it.  No doubt the game itself would work fine but then at the
__label__0 Got it as the free app of the day. Installs just fine, but crashes upon startup. Unable to actually play on the LG Optimus.
__label__0 Too bad.  It sounded like a truly innovative and fun game.  Like another guy, it just exits to the launcher after the &quot;loading&quot; screen on OG Droid.  It would be awesome if this is a bug that will be fixed rather than this being yet another game
__label__0 I get the splash screen and then it closes. does not work on my Moto droid A855. Glad I didn't pay for it.
__label__1 Well, after reading all the poor reviews I was really hesitant. After all I don't have a brand new phone (Nexus One) and Gingerbread is still hit or miss with some applications, but I'm very glad I gave a it a chance. For starters - the game installs its
__label__1 Great game. I enjoyed it a lot. nice concept. I wonder why the same apps/games that have 4.5 - 5 rating in Android market (which they deserve) always have 2-3 rating in the Amazon market.
__label__1 Similar play style as Blast Monkey, but much cuter and more fun. The physics-based attraction of the Nano Pandas makes for some unique puzzles. I enjoy it a lot. My one complaint is the menu buttons occasionally take several presses to work.
__label__1 I had the free version from Google Market, and love that it's an Amazon free app of the day (though i'd be happy to pay for it). The gameplay is fun and challenging. Runs well on my phone, and works great on my tablet. On tablet, the graphics are optimiz
__label__0 Extremely slow to start, then crashes often. I never got past the first level and gave up because of all the crashes and the amount of time to do anything. I can't review the play of the game because I never got to actually play it.
__label__1 very cute. challenging yet easy enough to be fun. Good App!I'm not sure what others complain about. if it doesn't work maybe it's your phone.
__label__1 Mind the people who don't know how to wait 5 more minutes for the free app to get registered as free, even past midnight. Amazon takes a bit of time for the free app of the day to actually show as free when you "purchase it."This is a great game, and it 
__label__1 Great looking and works perfectly on galaxy tab. Very polished like Angry Birds, fun gameplay too, but hard to use any skill, its magnets, maybe as get farther i'll pick up more on the patterns of the magnetism.
__label__0 Displays first screen but is completely unresponsive. Total fail on Asus Transformer with Android 3.1. Devs, please try actually running it on honeycomb before releasing for tablets.
__label__1 This is nearly as good and challenging as Angry Birds.  It takes a little bit to get used to how these flying pandas work.  Basically the attract each other and there are these laughing atom things that you are trying to fling the pandas in to.  It is re
__label__1 I cant stand the people that review a game low because it does not work on their phone. I think you may need a new phone! The app works great on my optimus and the game itself is fun and cute! Its definitely worth the $1 purchase.
__label__0 FCed when I tried to load it. May be a great game, but I can't find out on my Nexus One.
__label__0 WARNING!!! DON'T DOWNLOAD!!!  CRASHES LIKE CRAZY!!!The initial load was very long, even before Open Feint kicked in.  After that it was a 15 second wait until the menu music began to play.  One on the menu, I tapped Achievements to look at the achievemen
__label__0 So I figured people must have been exaggerating or had old phones, but no, this app just sucks. On my brand new Revolution it tried to load for almost a minute before going to a black screen and not responding. Could be a great game, bit I'll never know.
__label__1 Very original concept. Launching two pandas at different times can send each in a variety of directions. Enough levels for it to gradually become harder.
__label__0 This game doesn't work well at all on a Droid X. The game installs and operates very slow and seems to crash often. Uninstalled.
__label__0 Slow, boring game. Force closed many times. Once, didn't even start at all. Pass, even if free. Space too valuable.&euro;&euro;&euro;&euro;&euro;&euro;&euro;  adopt a shelter pet.  &euro;&euro;&euro;&euro;&euro;&euro;&euro;&euro;
__label__1 Fun game! Worked well for me- nexus One, Android 2.3.  Did have issues with Feint, but patience win the day.
__label__0 loads to main menu then FC! i am running 3.1 on ASUS Transformer Tablet. looks like a fun game though
__label__0 I never got to play this game because of Fient. it locked up while loading on my nexus s. if it can't run on pure Google what can it run on?I refuse to download any game running fient. it causes feezes, force closes, etc. no developer should use it.
__label__1 Figuring out the solution to each level is very fun. The objective and scoring are very straight forward (unlike Angry Birds) which means striving for a perfect score each level is actually enjoyable and skill-based not luck-based.
__label__0 Crashes and force closes instantly on T-Mobile G2. Seems like an interesting game though. Wish it worked. Will update score when it works.
__label__0 UnInstalled after a few attempts at second level. How do you even play this game?!?? Cool graphics but can't get very far.  Wouldn't recommend. Droid X.
__label__0 Motorola Droid.  Never gets past the loading screen.  How can you release an app not tested on a Droid?  Remove from market or insert incompatibility report.
__label__0 Like the title says, app won't install. It downloads just fine, but won't complete the install. First time I've ever had this problem.
__label__1 I love this book and reading it to my students.  Now, that I have a young son, I also enjoy reading it to him.  This app makes the book come alive for both of us and I myself thoroughly enjoy the sound effects.
__label__1 This is a fun book for children just learning to read. It bolsters confidence in reading and it is Dr Seuss!
__label__1 I love these books. I enjoy reading it to my son even if he is a little grow up now.
__label__1 works as it should, great little app. pictures are clear. sound is great on my phone and my nook color
__label__1 This app was bought for my granddaughter and she loves it it reads the book to her so she can take it all around the house
__label__1 My 3 year old daughter loves to play with Mr. Brown Can Moo and all of the Dr. Seuss book apps.  She loves how it both reads to her and she can click on either the words or pictures to have them said out loud.  A great learning app.
__label__1 The kids loved this.  It was wonderful to be able to sit down with them and get them involved.  They enjoyed the touch screen noises and when it read to them.  They also were able to read together which was nice.  I would recommend this and the other boo
__label__1 I totally love this, wow talk about keeping your mind quick this keeps me on my toes I know when I am having a hard day or a day that I have greater clarity. This is a great mental workout.
__label__0 I downloaded this game to my KF HD today, thinking this would be a great time killer. However, downloading Touch the Numbers ended up being a time WASTER! The game continually stopped responding on the opening screen where I input my name. I tried uninst
__label__1 This game is so much fun. The object is to hit the numbers in numerical order and try and get a better your score each time you play a new game.
__label__1 This website is awesome! I recommend it to anyone! I have started talking to a guy on eharmony and have met up with him already. we are planning on meeting again and I hope it eventually turns into a relationship!
__label__1 With this app I can access my eHarmony account from almost anywhere if my Kinddle is within range of a Wi-Fi signal. It is very convenient. I think many eHarmony users would enjoy this app.
__label__1 I've never had any problems whatsoever!I was able to complete entire profile, questionnaire, uploading of photos and browse my matches.  I would definitely recommend to friends & family...Great App! :-)
__label__1 i don't even need to log onto my computer to access e harmony anymore. Everything you need is on this app
__label__1 Every morning when I read my devotionals I end up by reading a few of these quotes to get my day started. They have a nice background that I wish more things I read had because it is pleasing to the eyes.
__label__1 just reading the example made me inspired GET THESE APP NOW 4REALS and the one by Michael Jordin made feel inspire to after my dream
__label__1 I love having the quotes on my Kindle Fire, there to read anytime I want....can't go wrong getting this app.  Awesome!
__label__0 it is so bad  i cant even describe how bad it is it repeats it doesn't let you favorite it is bad spelling and puncuation. don't get this app
__label__1 this game great but has no directions so here they are1. tap to pause.  2. swipe to change direction 3. can go through the walls.
__label__1 I have so much fun with this game. Since I grew up with a Nokia cell phone I played this game for hours when I was a teen.
__label__1 This app is a lot of fun. I love snake. This is the best snake game I hva found. I highly recommend this app. You should get this app.
__label__0 so bad I can't play that game anymore so don't buy this. its just bad bad I'm going delete this game
__label__1 wonderful app. no hassles. takes you strate to the game so u can get rite to playing.. i like it
__label__0 This app runs very, very clunky. Even though it was free, it wasn't worth the time to download and even play once. Boring.
__label__0 I was so dang confused!!!!!! It doesnt even make any sense!!!! I would Not recommend This app. It sucks butt.
__label__1 This game will engage you for hours! It definitely gets tricky. Game is user friendly on the Kindle Fire and I have found no glitches thus far. The game was free so I am extremely happy with the purchase!
__label__0 My 7-year-old is so fat he only plays his kindle fire he never wants to go outside with me he's always playing this game.
__label__1 I love this game! It's totally awesome. I play the classic snake game on the computer and wanted it for my kindle fire. I picked the right one. This is so much better than the other snake game and free too. I like being able to set different speeds and l
__label__1 I use this on my cell phone and ipad. It works great because it is fast on 3g as well as WiFi. If I could replace the default browser with this one and save the memory I would do so in a heartbeat!
__label__1 Absolutely a must for me and I recommend to everyone. This makes browsing on the phone so much more efficient. The Dolphin Browser HD is also wonderful, if you have a phone with decent resources.
__label__1 love the create your own gestures feature. tabbed browsing and easy cookie and cache cleaning helps it to work very well on tablets. clean & simple to use. highly recommended!
__label__1 i love this browser its fast and full featured.  i really wanted to like the firefox browser better as i love firefox on my desktop.  however its slower and more akward than dolphin...
__label__1 Instead of going into a lot of detail, let me just say I use this every time I go onto the internet with my cell.  In the window of this browser I have AOL, Google, Facebook, my bank, Walmart, and more.  All I have to do is click on the Dolphin icon on m
__label__0 Doesn't work with kindle hd. Uninstalled it. Still trying to find a kindle browser that I like. I like streaming internet radio directly from the station websites, not using I heart radio or pandora.
__label__0 I have  downloaded and tried several browsers. I'm looking for a browser that supports the Adobe Flash I have on my tablet. I heard good things about this one so I tried it. It starts to load the URL then stops about halfway. I tried refreshing, I tried 
__label__1 Much faster than the supplied browser on my phone. Has easy features to learn and is reliable. Well worth the low cost.
__label__1 I've had this for months now on my Thunderbolt.  After trying several different browser apps,  I found this one.  It works perfectly!  Quick,  searches Google in a flash,  is easy to read,  add bookmarks,  exit,  and just plain use in general.  I will ha
__label__1 I got tired of fighting with the default browser on the Thrive. I looked around and based on reviews decided to give Dolphin Browser Mini a try. It has not had any of the problems of the Thrive browser. I recommend it with no hesitations.
__label__1 I got an LG Thrive, which for a cheaper Android, is pretty decent, but the stock browser on it is terrible. It would load about 75% of the way and just hang on every other page you attempted to go to. I thought it was the wifi and I was on the edge singl
__label__1 The Dolphin Browser Mini (or its big brother, Dolphin Browser HD, which is not available from the Amazon App Store but is available from other sources) is a "must have" if only because it can identify itself as a Desktop browser instead of a mobile brows
__label__1 This app is by far the best free app I have downloaded. It has improved my phone's browser ten fold. so many features. all around 10 star app.  thank you
__label__1 I should say I have the HD version, and I sideloaded it onto my Kindle Fire. It works great though, makes a great upgrade to the vanilla amazon browser that comes with the Kindle. Even better, it supports flash so I can watch stuff like youtube on my kin
__label__1 Tried every browser. Even alpha tested some. This one takes the cake. Wish they could add some stuff, but it would take away from the simplicity and beauty in the design. Simple and fast for a great browser.Update: The update looks great!
__label__1 If only they had dolphin for the desktop!  This browser is efficient, very fast, and doesn't spend a lot of time updating tracking databases. Browsing speed increased by a factor of 5 over the default chrome browser on my phone.  This browser has worked 
__label__1 I originally got this for my Kindle Fire HD and worked great.  I got this for my android smart phone a works just as good.
__label__0 This is a very good browser and better than the default Android browser.New Update.I've been using Dolphin Mini browser for a few months now and I no longer like it.Most of the links that I use on websites will not open up in this browser.I also have tro
__label__1 Took a second to figure how it works, and that you fill in the info. on the right and read the results on the left, but... cripes!... this thing converts EVERYTHING and does it easily.
__label__1 I love this package.  I use it to convert British pounds to Euros to American dollars.  I also use it quite a lot to convert measurements (dry and wet) so I can convert grams to troy ounces to pennyweights.  Most helpful tool.  My husband and I watch som
__label__1 I purchased this app on the app store for my Kindle Fire. I could not be happier with the usefullness of this product and so far have had absolutely no problems with using this app. It is very intuitive.
__label__1 I like this app.  I am always looking for a conversion factor for metric to imperial measurements whether it is kilometers or millimeters.
__label__1 This is a handy app for making all kings of conversions.  If you need to go to from metric to standard this is useful.
__label__1 Great conversions. You can convert measurement into almost any other measurement. Covers a wide range of measurements. I use it frequently.
__label__1 This program has every unit conversion you could imagine. I don't use some of them, but it lets you customize the units that you use and don't have to scroll through units you don't use or even understand what they do. Great free program.
__label__1 There are conversions in here I did not know existed. I originally purchased it for a quick currency converter (works great, especially if you update the currency rates frequently...done by clicking the &#34;update currency&#34; button).I have used it fo
__label__1 This Unit Converter is very complete, having every category I could even conceivably need and all of the standard units, including some obscure ones I never heard of before. This installed and runs perfectly on myKindle Fire, Full Color 7" Multi-touch Di
__label__1 This is a very handy app I use it quite often and highly recommend it if you need to do conversions on weight, area, volume, angles, Etc Etc
__label__1 If you do any sort of engineering work of any kind,this app beats the stuffing out of your calculator. Don't need to do no key sequences.etc. Wow...very nicely done. The list of conversion categories is just staggering.
__label__1 I find this app very useful.  The set-up has many category selections, within that, there are units, and then value.  I didn't know there is a difference in a US cup and a metric cup - I thought a cup was a cup!  So, not only do I get the information I t
__label__0 I purchased and installed this app on my kindle fire and it seemed to work just fine the first time, but after that first run all it does now is cause the screen to flash and then returns home.  I uninstalled it a few minutes later.
__label__1 Item one great buy I love it , I use all the time.it a must keep app.I use at the office ,home and with  school work.
__label__1 Nifty little program to do simple converting. I do recommend this program for simple everyday use at home or in the store.
__label__1 i downloaded this to my Kindle Fire and i use this all the time. it works great. No Complaints at all
__label__1 I have seen many of these types of programs especially for Windows. Most were a febel attempt to make a in depth program. How come it took Android opperating system to get something this in depth onto the market. I have an engineering degree in electroni
__label__1 I was looking for a free currency converter, when I came across this one. works like a champ and the choices to pick from are amazing.  hard to believe it is free! love it.
__label__1 No matter how many times I tried to convert a niumber to a fraction, I always had to ask someone else for the formula. Not anymore, this works each time, everytime! What a great app.
__label__1 I was looking for a metric converter but found more than that. I don't know what some of the categories are, but it's good to have.  Too bad I didn't have something even close to this in high school or college.  Remember that?  When we had to do everythi
__label__1 I use many of these conversions on a daily basis.  Great app.  Interface is not immediately intuitive but once you realize how the app is set up finding conversions is extremely easy.
__label__1 I give this app very high marks for the flexible way that you can choose your favoite categories of measurement and make it even easier than the way it comes with all of the areas selected.  It is quick, easy to understand and best of all it's FREE!
__label__1 This is great because you just enter one unit of measurement, such as an inch and it converts it to about 40 other units which can be easily scrolled through to find the one you want.
__label__1 First let me say that I am NOT a rocket scientist and some of the functions on this I not only do not NEED, I don't even know what they are!!  Hubby is an engineer and he was very impressed with this app too.  You can also have the exchange rate set up o
__label__0 Enytime I try to go on it just quits me out. Its a good app but it only lets you use it twice
__label__1 I don't use this Ap often although when I need to do a conversion it is GREAT! I've used it for dimensions, weather and more.
__label__1 This application has been very useful for me in many instances. No matter what I'm looking to convert from or to, this application has it!
__label__1 What a great app!  It makes all type of conversions and calculations easy as pie to do.  This app takes all the guesswork out of any conversion calculation.
__label__1 Well I was looking for a free converter for medical calculations and every day stuff I got more than I expected and have covertions for things I never have to do I think. But fun to try them out. Perfect for those inquiring minds
__label__1 This is a universal converter.  You specify a value, and it gives you the conversions in an easy to understand format.  You enter a value in miles, for example, and it gives you the conversion in kilometer, inches, feet, etc.Highly recommended.  And it i
__label__1 This app has been useful in all situations. I use it for school, vacations, track and field,  and everday use as well. It is current and up-to-date. Has all types of units from all countries including biblical units. Does currency, weight, mass, yada yad
__label__1 Always needing to convert something and this is a great tool!! Another 5 stars!! Thanks and Works great!! So helpful
__label__1 ConvertPad - Unit Converter can't be beat. It converts every possible thing that can be measured, even currency! This is the kind of app I would expect to pay 2 or 3 dollars for, yet its free for the taking. It's a must have in my Kindle Fire tool kit. M
__label__1 I use this app all the time. It converts everything I need. I have it on both my Kindle Fire and my Driod Razr Maxx and use the app on both all the time. It converts so many different types of measurement such as sound, ring size, prefixes, illumination,
__label__1 This app looks and works great. Thank you to the developers. This really helps me with work tasks. Very much appreciated.
__label__1 This is a very versetile calculator for your device that has all of the basic, and some advance, functions that you would ever need to do saome math. It is also great at conversions from metric to american and visa versa.
__label__1 I really like the conversions on the Unit Converter which readily converts items into Metric plus dollars into euros and other helpful conversions.
__label__1 This app has far outreached my expectations, to a fault if anything. It has many many different types of measurements.
__label__0 ConvertPad has proven useful, except for making temperature conversion between F and C. So far I have not been able to find a way of entering a negative temperature.
__label__1 I have had this app on my Androi phones (present and past).  It is indespensible.  I am a scientist cannot remember all this stuff but it is all here.  It even has a currency converter which updates.  Even has a place to store your own special conversion
__label__1 Simple layout works just as it should. This app is extremely helpful now when I need to convert anything, I no longer have to do a search for a conversion calculator as this one does it all and its free.
__label__1 This is a good all around app that does everything, conversion-wise.  Have used it many times...mostly for dollar to whatever, and for tips.
__label__1 The book &#34;Life at the Extremes&#34; (on my Kindle Fire) has the temperatures in Celcius only. With this app on my cellphone, I get an instant conversion to Fahrenheit. Easy to use, too.
__label__1 I downloaded this for my Android phone and now I have it on my Kindle Fire.  I can't think of a unit conversion I would need that this app doesn't have.  For free too!!!
__label__1 I have tried about 4 or 5 other conversion apps, and none were satisfactory.  This app does it all, quickly and easily, and does more conversion types than any of the others.  As far as I am concerned this is the one you should try first.
__label__1 This app let's you convert between different measurement systems quickly and easily. It's very handy for carpentry and mechanical work.
__label__1 This app has everything one could ever need.  I had two converters on my phone before.  Now only one.  Thank you.
__label__1 VERY EASY AND HANDY SINCE I MAKE ORDERS FROM OTHER COUNTRIES AND LIKE TO KNOW THE EXACT AND CURRENT RATE OF EXCHANGE.
__label__1 I've had to use it to convert lengths and fluid volumes. It's a very handy tool. For example, the fuel additive I bought recommended adding an amount in ounces, but the measurement marks on the package were in milliliters.  I used ConvertPad to solve the
__label__1 Had this on my smartphone first for several years and then put it on my kindle HD when I got it.  Great converter, though the way it is set up is a little bust and there is a learning curve in trying to figure out how to use it.  You can do just about an
__label__1 I have been using this app on my cell phone for years. Just added it to my kindle fire. One of my all time favorite apps.
__label__1 Love this app.  I frequently need to convert from cm to inches, or from Centigrade to farenheit (or back).  It will covert just about anything.
__label__1 If your phone/tablet can play Warheads this COULD be the one to show friends what your Android device can do.This version has almost everything from the old Atari classic Missile Command and enhances it with beautiful 3D graphics and animation effects. O
__label__1 This is basically Missile Command, but with updated graphics.  Great graphics, great pace, great sound effects.  This is one of the few old school games that manages to keep its appeal even in such a faithful recreation.  Awesome.
__label__1 Very cool game, faithful to missile command, good music just wish there was ambient war sounds in the background to give it a good effect and i can't really hear the missiles firing and explosions, but all in all props to the developer, good job, but ple
__label__1 this is a fun addictive game. It lags a bit but that can be fixed in the settings. blah blah blah, get it.
__label__1 Good graphics, well built game. Very repetitive gameplay, but hey with a premise like this what would you expect? Nice sound, too.
__label__0 I'm tried of of being asked to post my scores, playtime and other information to feint,  so when I see the leaves,  it gets one star.
__label__1 This is by far the best missile defense game I've played since the original missile commmand came out. The graphics look good, the effects are great, and the action moves fast. I can see how the particle effects may slow down some lower end machines. But
__label__1 This game is a killer blend of old and new school technologies, and I love seeing the classics come to the Android platform.  5 stars!  Droid incredible.
__label__0 Two things in order for me to want this.  Get higher resolution screen shots. These are horrible. Gives you the idea that graphics suck. And ditch feint, I don't want to post scores and hate being asked every time. At least put an option to turn off fein
__label__1 This game is simply amazing. The music is epic, the visuals are amazing and the game play is what you'd expect from a missile defense game.Definitely give it a try! You won't be disappointed.
__label__1 Fun missile defense game.  Graphics are great.  Did not expect it to look this good.The key to long term survival is to not waste ammo and don't lose bases.
__label__1 I was a little hesitant to d/l this game w/its huge file size since my phone doesn't have a lot of internal memory to play with but I was relieved to see that all but 760kb went onto my SD card.  :D  I think the graphics are just wonderful and, contrary 
__label__0 The gameplay is the same as old missile defense games of yore. The graphics are pretty good,  and while the screen shake effect seems kind of cool it wears thin pretty fast. Voicee overs also become annoying pretty fast,  perhaps if there was more variet
__label__0 are you kidding!? this has to be the most dull game ever! no friggin joke... dont bother wasting your time hoping that it gets better like i did ... haha
__label__1 Good app, very challenging game play.  It is a little laggy on my Galaxy S, but I am sure some of the newer phones would have absolutely no problem.  Would be nice if you could lower the graphics significantly.  I had to uninstall because it would not pl
__label__0 Worked on my other phone and was very nice, too bad it crashes as soon as it starts on HTC ONE X
__label__1 This is a great game its not hard and its not boring and its allot of fun.its alwjays fun to beat your high score
__label__1 You should get this game its a great time waster. Its can't get hard after level 20. Give this game a 5 ratings.
__label__0 Not a bad concept, but it has got to be the most annoying game ever. No way to turn the sound off, and the volume control button does nothing when the game is open. And the options in the settings menu are impossible to switch. Gameplay isnt bad, but I c
__label__1 I enjoy game remakes that are faithful to the original.  Well done.  This is a fun game.  How many characters do you need?
__label__1 So I read the description and as soon as I saw the words missile defense I was like great this is gonna be a missile command rip off. Well that's exactly what this is and its fantastic. I hated the original missile command but this game looks beautiful a
__label__1 This game is actually quite challenging once you dive into it. On top of that it's a completely new concept of shooting your own missiles to block missiles. Collateral damage, cool graphics, and smooth game play are all nice on my samsung galaxy s vibran
__label__1 I have to admit that this makes my phone smell like poop but I really don't mind. I am going to like it, poop or no poop.
__label__1 hey! Pay Atten!  this is not Missle Command Classic!  This Warhead game is like Missle Command.. BUT.. it's come with 360 degree defense!!  i love this game!!  realism missle attack and ground shake... so real game!!  i m giving this game 5 stars!!T mobi
__label__1 Wow! An amazing remake of the classic 80's arcade. Amazing graphics and sound effects make the game 10 times more enjoyable than the original.
__label__1 I just downloaded the app and played ten waves.  This is a good missile defense app.  The graphics look great on my Samsung Vibrant.  There are a lot of missiles raining down on your four different sectors so you have to stay sharp.  Nice addition to the
__label__1 I still haven't gotten bored of it and I have had it for thee months.How can you get bored of this
__label__0 My Daughter says she isn't impressed with this app, she says in her opinion it lagged out to much.  She says you could only do so much in one day.
__label__0 Galaxy Vibrant (TMobile). Was super excited to create my own zombie pet (Benesaizombie) but couldn't even get it to load. Took four attempts to uninstall! Wants to retrieve other app info. Remember it is always a bad idea to store passwords and other sen
__label__0 I'm keen come on purplepenguin can u do any better with it this game sucks. so bad I just I cant even begin
__label__1 this game is the BEST game ever in the world and people do not know wat they are talking about
__label__1 is the most awesome game in the history of history! I love love love love love love loved the game
__label__1 It was WORTH EVERY PENNY;) Lol. in all seriousness, if you are bored its a nice thing to play once a month, and it has great graphics, but then again, I could stare at a wall for 5 hours and not get hired, so maybe that is simply me.
__label__0 This app was not fun at all. I was thinking something like Nintendogs, but with a fun twist, but completely wrong. I played it for ten minutes and was completely bored. I gave it another undeserving ten minutes of play and noticed nothing was going to ha
__label__0 if I could lower the rating on this game I would. there is no point in this app. play for about 10 seconds and you'll see. If you are looking at this app, you're wasting your time.
__label__0 it's a simple 3d model with few actions. they added a poor leveling system wherein you gain expeience and levels by going through a few of the model's pre-programed actions. i'm sure it was quite a bit of work for one guy(or girl), but this isnt a game.
__label__1 I love this game and my mom. said I'm to young to have this gamesoyeahmymomissortameansoyeahokward
__label__0 I don't no if I should get this app is it good or is it bad.please tell me I need to no now
__label__0 What a horrible scam it is the worst game ever if you want a fun zombie game or atleast something you can laugh at play memes vs. zombies. This game SUKS N00BS!!!!
__label__0 Terrible graphics along with confusing gameplay.  This game made me want to throw my whole tablet away.  Do NOT even try this game!
__label__0 so I get this app thinking it would be like zombie life but more graphic. boy was I wrong all u do is press a button to watch a zombie jump up and down, or another one to make it eat ( which is just him doing had mottions into his mouth). the people who 
__label__0 this game is soooo w and i've seen games like it. i would NOT recemend this to friends or family. it needs more stuff than feed and run.
__label__0 holy crap that's kreepy when I shod my cuz he ran away and hit the wall ha ha classical and had be take to the dang docter cruse u game!
__label__0 totally not worth it at all. graphics are lame. got boring very fast.  not at all what I had expected.  all you do is beat it up and watch it move very dumbly
__label__0 I did not get it if u hate it like I do I recommend block story minecraft etc.but wat do I know I'm just a nine year old...
__label__1 I'm a person and I think peaple are lame so ya don't call apps lame this one is great creators you did a good job but come out with a my pet zombie 1,2,3 I bet they will be great.
__label__0 so boring I fell asleep litilary I mean ur just watching the zombie do stuff I thought it would be cool but I thought wrong do not get it and I do no regimens this to a friend
__label__0 this game is so lame and boring I truly don't recomend it for any one I wish I read the reviews. first
__label__0 one of the worst games I have ever played. waste time. If I could give it no stars I would.
__label__0 Very few things to do and you only press buttons. Played for a minute then quit. Boring!!!!!!!!!!!!! Waste of a download.
__label__1 I love it its a good game of u really like zombies right frank uhuhuhuhuhuhuh well got to go I'm chilling with my zombie say bye frank uhuhuhuh
__label__0 Too bad. I would have liked to have tried this game. It just says &quot;Loading...&quot; but never does anything else. I even set my kindle down and went to lunch. When I came back it was still the same.
__label__1 this is the game where there is nothing to say about sceptically for it is the awesomest game I downloaded
__label__0 I was hoping for a cool zombie game. it is a really cool idea but this game does not really live up to it. very little options. hope someone expands on this idea.
__label__0 I have used this app for ages because I usually fly on AA.However, there is now a version 3.5.1 for this app, and I can find no way to get the updated version on Kindle Fire.Therefore I can no longer use this app on my Kindle.Hopefully Amazon will resolv
__label__1 Kindle Fire User:  I am so glad that I stopped trying to get the Flightview app to work and got the American Airlines app instead. I have access to my entire account right there so I can be assured that the information is the most current and is correct.
__label__1 I find this very handy as I use a AA vard and travel as much as I can with AA . They call with update the day you are flying so that help to arrange the proper time to travel time to airports.
__label__1 Due to weather several of my flights were delayed and the AA program was easy to access and get my updated information.  It also gave me connecting gate information before I even got off the first plane to the connecting flight.  Very helpful!
__label__1 allows us to check on the flights that we are taking with AA and be sent notifications of their departure. Can check in on the phone...we will see how well this works when we are in St Maarten
__label__1 Before retiring I flew more than 100,000 miles a year and never left the United States.  This little ap was my most used software while travelling.  Don't leave home without it.
__label__1 I really do like being able to review my flight arrangements and view my options for all of my travel needs.
__label__1 I got this when I booked travel on American Airlines, and it is easy to navigate and use. No issues to report.
__label__0 Downloaded and installed just fine. Tried to log in and got a pop up window that said not supported, upgrade app to use.Well that would all well and dandy, but not place have I found to get an update.
__label__0 I havn't had a chance to use it. I am not a globe trotter, but at first glance, the rates didn't seem attractive.
__label__1 Gives me more flexibility when sitting in an airport which is all too frequent these days. Now we need an App for reserving overhead bin space.
__label__1 Very easy to use. It is actually better than Flight Status. It also show you the flight route map in real-time (maybe a little bit delayed)
__label__1 Use it all the time! We check flights daily and this is one of the few we trust. The best!
__label__1 I had use it various times. it works well and it is easy. It is very close to real time. very accurate so far. I had no problems with it. I can monitor my trips and my guests trips.
__label__1 i got this app while i was on a flight to California using inflight WIFI. I needed to know what gate my connecting flight was and if i had enough time to make my connection. I downloaded this app and not only did it show me the connecting information i a
__label__1 I purchased this app -- the free version is great but the paid version gives you the flight times.Hopefully they'll update it with more options in the future.  If you do purchase the app pleaselist your requests/wishes in your feedback. Hopefully they'll
__label__1 I get a more accuate time, without going back and forth to the ticket counter. You don't have to wait in long lines to ask a question.
__label__0 Kindle Fire User: I tried this app and was happy with it for a couple of days. Then, out of nowhere, it started changing my flights to "past" status even though they are months in the future. I refreshed constantly and it didn't help at all. ALSO THE ADD
__label__1 I use this to track flights my family and I take from florida, to michigan anf to florida, as well as other vacation trips.
__label__1 I LOVE this!  I work at LAX and this has been one of the best things I've ever come across.  This totally eliminates the need to either call the airlines or run from terminal to terminal to check on a flight.  This also works great when you have code-sha
__label__1 This app. is an excellent one. I use it constantly while flying because it provides more up to date information about my flights than the airline app.
__label__1 This is a must for every air traveler.  It shows every flight between two airports!  When you're stuck or when you're planning it is a real help.
__label__0 this didn't work on my k/fire.  I wanted to track a flight from London and it wouldn't show me it's location.  I then booted up the lap  top to there website and it worked great conclusion app is not as good at least for int'l flight.. Price is right!!
__label__1 Great device for tracking flights on your tablet.  I have similar products on my PC and phone and this one works just as well as both other versions.
__label__1 Very easy to use app, which tells me just what I want to know...whether to arrive at the airport early or put off the trip for a while, when picking up my frequent travelers. It shows the progress of the flight along the route, which is fun to see, updat
__label__1 excellent and easy to use.
__label__1 This is perfect.  Beats waiting outside an airport for a plane that has been delayed because of weather or some other reason.
__label__1 I use this app whenever I'm flying or someone I know is flying overseas to be able to tell exactly when they have landed for airport pickup. This app is very detailed and accurate.
__label__1 This is a nice app, and it doesn't appear to be stripped down or crippled as many free apps are. I used it yesterday to track my wife's flight from Atlanta, Georgia to Austin, Texas. I entered some other flights just to check out the app, and it really w
__label__1 Easy to enter flights and a nice clear layout. Very up to date information. My gate changed and I knew about it almost instantly.
__label__1 I have used this app to flight-follow a family member's trips, and I really like the departure and arrival information about the flights.  And a bonus is the airborne flight-following feature.  Not only is it great to know that someone has departed or ar
__label__1 So easy to use and you get the map of the flying route.  Works for all airlines.  Even tells you type of plane, how high they are flying, and how much actual flying time left.
__label__0 i dont even remember using this i deleted it so fast it must have been totally worthless. but it was free so try yourself
__label__1 I've used this app on my iPhone for a long time. Very precise and accurate. I like knowing when the plane lands. Where the airline websites only tell you when the plane arrives at the gate.
__label__1 My favorite!!!
__label__1 This app works great and the best part of it that it is free
__label__1 Must have app if you or a love one do a lot of flying or going on trips and then some.
__label__1 As a former private pilot, I found this progarm outstanding.  It provides me with more then necessary information I need to plan my flight.  I highly recommend this program.  One need not be a pilot to use this.
__label__1 Super tool to track flights. Works on domestic and international flights. If you call the airport they will give you minimum info. With this app. you will know where the. Flight is and you can plan your pick up better. For me a definate keeper.
__label__1 Have you ever wondered just where in their flight your loved one was when flying to a destination?  This is an easy to use app that shows exactly the place in the sky the plane is traveling.  Times are given so you can judge when to leave for the airport
__label__1 Love to use this to tack flights anytime anywhere. Even if you don't know the flight number or even airlines you can find a flight you are looking for.
__label__1 This app keeps me informed of  flights that I am  going to be on or  flights family members are goingto be on, I love it
__label__1 Hey I love this app.  You can track your flights on your kindle.  When you have a few layovers it is very handy.  I felt quite smart using this app.  During the cold winter months, when there are massive cancelations... this thing is just a &#34;must hav
__label__1 I was recently traveling in bad weather so my flight times were constantly being changed.  This app let me see the changes before we were ever notified by the airline.
__label__1 Great resource and very easy to use.Good app and would recommend other flyers add it to their electronic resources.
__label__1 Boy is this a handy app to track flights.  Really easy to use - love the map interface - strongly recommended to anybody who ever picks up anybody at the airport!
__label__1 Whenever people fly out to see us I can track their flight all the way across the world. The nicest thing is you know whether there going to arrive early or late. Saves a lot of waiting time at the airport.
__label__1 No more wondering if the flight has arrived while waiting in the cellphone lot. It lets you know in real time. A very useful app if you fly a lot or offer to pick up friends and family at the airport. Used to have to hunt for this info on my laptop at ho
__label__1 This app is quick and easy to find a flight, see the stats on the flight and where the plane is at the moment.
__label__0 I Have 15 seconds for level 1 that's just stupid I haven't past level 1 yet and the reveiws that said it sucked they were right don't ever get this game! its slow  on  kindle fire too.
__label__0 this is a terrible game never get it. it is slow and it times you to try to get a goal it doesn't let you okay to a certain score. don't get it.
__label__0 this game speed is very very slow. I cannot tell what is happening it is very confusing. I do not reccomend this game at all.
__label__0 after 10 seconds I deleted it. it got so boring so fast. it was also really laggy on my kindle.
__label__0 I didn't like it what so ever it was slow and it seemed to freeze it isn't very good on kindle fire not recommended for anyone
__label__1 This game is fun. I don't play too many games and this one was exactly what I expectedGood graphics
__label__0 this app is pretty stupid, you'll know what I'm talking about when ur deleting it. this is definatly one the the worst app on the market. but its free.
__label__1 if it says ur not touching the screen u can change the sentitvity of the touch. this is a fun game and works if u know.Wat's good
__label__1 AS I SAID BEFORE, MY GRANDCHILDREN ARE AS HOOKED TO AMAZON.COM AS I AM. THE HOCKEY LITE IS A GAME I DIDN'T KNOW THEY HAD. I'LL BE SURE TO LET THEM SHOW ME HOW IT WORKS. THE OTHER GAMES ARE BEING PLAYED REGULARLY, SO I'M SURE THIS ONE IS TOO. BEING FREE I
__label__0 this was not my fav app and it was really slow ecspecially with the kindle fire so if you have one do not get this app it was BORING!!!!!!!!! :(
__label__0 do not bother geting this they have faster free air hockey apps don't get this lags on my kindle fire
__label__1 I played this game for a short while and determined it's a keeper.  I have always enjoyed air hockey and when I found this game, I had to have it.  Happy with it, lots of fun and takes a bit of focus and strategy to win.  :)
__label__0 this app has a unbeleivable amount of lag on my kindle fire, I removed it within 10 seconds. what ever u do don't download it
__label__0 I wuz playing wit my friend and we couldn't even play it Cu's it kept saying we weren't touching the friggin thing. if I could rate this a lower number it wunderkind b -342578975432097654332112335667990087655443322113445_55667788887$#!* u autocorrect!!!!
__label__1 I didn't get it for no reason. . .  . .. . n n. . . . . . . n .
__label__1 The 2-player mode works excellent on my gTab, there are not many free 2-player air hockey games and this ne works exactly as expected.
__label__0 All I have to say about it is that its dumb, stuipid, and a huge rip off!!!!!!!!! Just don't buy it!!!!!!!!
__label__1 I dont care if u guys like it or not its ur own oppinion so shut ur mouth about it and.just pretend u love it ok that would be good ok u can say something bad about it but only in ur head ok is that ok with u yes or no people I need to know so think fast
__label__0 This game is the worst game ever! It looked fun but its not! Don't get this app! Take my word for it.
__label__1 love it huh hm u nh h u tc g y Bhutan ty g buy. Gb. by buggy Gb g g
__label__0 Much like the other reviews I found this app to be slow and problematic on the Kindle Fire. The developer needs to rethink this app's design as its not release ready.
__label__0 this app sucks if you have a fire it cant tell if I'm touching the screen or not and its very slow. don't waste your time I deleted it right away.
__label__0 It does not matter what device you have. It only gives you 20 sec. to play the first ****in' level!
__label__1 The most amazing technology since the phone!!!It's incredible how you don't even have to touch devices just your hands and the tranfer takes place because of the vibrations in the cloud!!! Wow!
__label__1 Works on Android and iPhones.  Essential app for sharing contact details or other information between phones.  Oh, and it is free.
__label__1 This app is a great way to share apps, pictures and contact information.  I didn't realize that pictures were compressed to send MMS and end up being lower quality on the receiving phone until a friend told me and told me to use Bump and it wouldn't do t
__label__0 wanted to share some pics from my phone to my Samsung tablet. It asked for GPS even though they are on the same wifi network.  Then it wouldn't work.  It asks for a heck of a lot of permissions considering I just wanted to share a pic with myself.  Unins
__label__1 I actually purchased this product, and it performed as described.  However I have since deleted because I found that I did not use the product and didn't want it to take up space in my smart phone.
__label__1 If I could give this app 10 starts I would.  It works very good although it does not get all the garage sale listings from Craigslist, it does get most of them.  The paid version is well worth it because it will give you voice directions.  The graphics a
__label__0 At the time I installed this on my Kindle Fire HD, it started up really slow and lagged alot. Not very useful.
__label__0 This didn't give me any information that I could use. Maybe because I have the Kindle. No GPS. It's probably a fine product in an android or gps contained device, but not for me.
__label__1 We recently moved to a rural area in Maryland and are about equi-distant from three (3) Craigs List areas.  People list in all three.  There are numerous small towns and communities and it is very time consuming to search all three lists for all the smal
__label__0 If this app is free, why am I being asked for a payment method? I'd like to try it if it's free!
__label__1 This App is very helpful in my business.  There are many things a business needs and this is definitely one.
__label__1 I absolutely love this app!! I sell Thirty-One products, and it's so easy to plug in the info to get a broken-down total. I highly recommend this to anyone in direct sales or with their own business!!
__label__1 As a new Independent MK Consultant, this really helps me figure out how much to charge my clients and customers for delivery, adding tax to subtotals, and add which percentage I need to get paid for my time. Very convenient, there is also an ad-free edit
__label__0 Once I installed this app on my TF Prime, I noticed these green + in my notification bar. It was spam, I have never seen that much or that kind before. I talked to my nerd friend & he gave me a link to an article about it.&lt;...>I installed the recommen

__label__1 This is a simple bubble popper game, but with very nice graphics. I've always liked games like this, and this one is very well done, and addictive. It is fun to see the bubbles flex as they drop and slide over.
__label__0 Impossible to play this game of you are colorblind. Wonder why they would discriminate like this against colorblind people. Would have been able to rate better if I could actually enjoy the game.
__label__1 This is a nice easy little game but a lot of fun. Can get addicting and the bonus games a funny sometimes.
__label__1 quit crying if your colorblind! that has nothing to do with the gameplay if you are unable to see the game uninstall it you nitwits! like a blind man complaining about the color of a rose!
__label__0 Close to one of twelve males are colorblind; this game is unplayable for them (me). Many (most?) similar games have the option of using colorblind mode -- symbols or textures in addition to colors -- or a gray scale mode. At the very least, have it play 
__label__1 thanks app develop, this game is very fun and has awesome graphics. it feels as if im floating among the clouds with all the bubbles popping and cloud like effects. i think its a very well wrote game and is fun yet to boot.. thanks for everything u have 
__label__1 installed this game and it froze my phone vibrant 4g during gameplay. after a reboot it has been running great. the graphics and sounds are pretty decent love that it can load to the sd card as well. sorry for all the colorblind people out there but stil
__label__0 for many years the internet has advicated the senseless slaughter of bubbles. these small creatures have done nothing but amuse children and bring adults mindless fun when someone farts in the pool! we must take a stand against this injustice of bubbles.
__label__0 What about a color blind mode?There is no way that a color blind person can play this game.Don't waste your money if you are color blind.
__label__0 played on my new Acer a500 tablet where I pop it does not register but somewhere near by. and of course not full screen on a 10.1 tablet
__label__1 I've played other bubble popping games but this is the prettiest.Downloaded it right when it &quot;popped&quot; up as the free app of the day. The bonus game between rounds is something new.Sammy Fascinate
__label__1 This game works perfectly on nook color. It is full screen and calibrated. Runs smoothly and does not freeze. A great game.
__label__1 Don't know what other people's problem is cuz I have a Droid x &amp; it worked flawlessly for me. You tap 2 or more of the same color bubbles to pop them. It makes a fun popping sound that I find awesome for whatever reason. It's a good, simple time wast

__label__1 This is probably my favorite game. I try others but always come back to this again. Has never frozen my epic.
__label__1 Downloaded this hoping it was a lot like the game on my old Windows phone.  Turns out this is WAY better.  Great gameplay, graphics and sounds.  Works great on the gTab.  Free or paid, it is a great game.
__label__0 Only would get a black screen every time i tried to open the app. Several attempts  made then uninstalled. Driod X
__label__0 downloaded just fine. every time i try to open the gane to play it my screen goes black.I'm glad it was free. it looked pretty cool.  does not work on stock EVO 4G.
__label__1 this game runs flawlessly on my droid 2. it's cute. the graphics are just cute,and the soundtrack is calming. sound effects made me giggle. i like it. ;-D
__label__0 No surprise this one made it to FAD considering how worthless it is. just another puzzle popper game clone like the millions out there. Only difference is you paid $2.99 for this. Hey, at least it's free for today.
__label__1 Anyone who loved PuyoPuyo will definitely love this game. The concept is fairly simple: pop 2 or more adjacent bubbles to pop them. Calculate how to best pop the bubbles to clear all bubbles off the level. The classic mode is NOT timed, so it is easy to 
__label__1 Great graphics, addictive play, and fun sound effects. I gave it a shot when it was the free-app-of-the-day here, and was surprised and pleased by how solid and entertaining ity turned out to be! Check it out!
__label__1 thanks Amazon for this loverly game today. this game is bubble burst, that game that used to come with all phones, but cuter.  I figured it'll b great for my two year old but didn't want to download since it said not compatible with all tablets.  but aft
__label__1 If you are into butterflies then is app is for you, it is so real like I could not believe it
__label__0 application never opened so it's kinda hard to rate it.  i don't quite understand why it didn't open but you may wanna look into it
__label__0 cant get it to load or work on my phone. Anything else I have gotten worked but this one doesn't.
__label__0 I can't even open the app so I really can't rate it. The pic is pretty on the outside though
__label__0 I uninstalled this one. It just flat out didn't work for the tablet. I think this one may be made for a phone sized screen.
__label__1 Beautiful! Not too much to say about this, the photo is self explanatory. We both love butterflies so this seemed like a nice background.
__label__0 I don't like it doesn't fit the screen both ways when you move tablet from long to tall and it is kinda boring of most screen savers I have already deleted it.
__label__0 DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS! IT IS A HORRIBLE WASTE OF TIME. NOT WHAT YOU WANT TRUST ME I KNOW THIS
__label__1 Looks sweet on my Samsung Galaxy 4.0 MP3 player.  You can change the size of the wallpaper and speed. My skin on the player is shades of pink so this is a great compliment.
__label__1 This game is a lot of fun, I like the journey mode. Great if, like me, no one you know is willing to go up against you in parcheesi.
__label__1 You will really like this game. It is easy to play. Very close to the board game. You will get hooked
__label__1 great game. works good with kindle fire. have had no problems. I like all the opitions you have. can choose how many you want to play against.
__label__1 If you like the game trouble...then you will love this game...it is just like it and lots of fun to play...I like that I can make it 2 player and play the computer &#34;AL&#34; and he doesn't cheat either...nice game to play when you want some quite time
__label__0 I didn't like how this game was set up and was a little confusing at first. I got bored very easily

__label__0 Playing on Samsung note 2. The rules are not the Parcheesi I'm familiar with. Single die so no doubles. Throw a 6 to start, not 5 and sometimes rolling a 6 would get another turn, sometimes not. The final straw, and what I gave it 1 star for- had to rest
__label__1 This game is very addictive.  I use to play this online everyday and would sit for hours play and chatting with friends.  Highly recommend it!!!!
__label__1 If you remember that game as a youngster and liked it you'll love this app. Warning, playing against 3 computer opponents is time consuming. Graphics are just average but game play is accurate to the old style board game. I recommend this app.
__label__1 Like the game, it keeps me going and a good game to play when I can't sleep at night, though I sometimes lose track of time & it's daylight!
__label__1 This app is just like the games I used to play as a kid.  Lots of fun and has new additions that make some spaces different with safe and roll again.
__label__1 I had a lot of with this game. Super fun if you like board games. It is a great time waster. Works great on Kindle Fire.
__label__1 A lot like aggravation with a few twist. Trust me, I have felt like throwing my kindle out the window a few times. My favorite games are Aggravation and Sorry and this game gives me a little taste of both. NOW if someone would do Spite and Malice,  I wou
__label__1 I like this app for Kindle Fire.  I was looking for something just like this.  I used to play this game in Windows 3.1.  The old Sierra Hoyle games were bright and colorful.  This is my new replacement.  Also has AI and can play against 1 computer compon
__label__1 I got this game a while back and it reminds me of the board game Trouble! It's a fun game and easy to play. I enjoy it when I'm up at night feeding my newborn because I don't have to think much when I'm half asleep :P Definitely recommend it for anyone w
__label__1 Awesome app. Easy to navigate. Transfers are easy. You can view all accounts. I had questions on one of my accounts and sent an email. It was answered within an hour!
__label__1 I mainly downloaded this app to make it easier for me to pay my disocer bill every month.  This app certainly does that flawlesly.  No complaints so far.
__label__1 I love this app.  So much faster and easier!  I also love my Kindle Fire as it does all I need to do....

__label__1 when i need it my information is available and it is safe. quick free and easy way of doing  things without my computer in hand

__label__1 This app. is perfect for all your mobile banking needs. I never go on their website, i just monitor and make all payments and transfers through this app.
__label__1 I have been using Discover for several years and there has never been a problem.  I would certainly recommend Discover

__label__1 If you have a credit card it is a must to have. you can do everything with this app. do
__label__1 This app provides you with balances, all transactions and more. And to top it off, it was free. 5 stars!
__label__1 I really found it somewhat inconvenient to pop open my laptop to check on my accounts, but with this app I was able to register my Kindle as a trusted device that I frequently use, instead constantly answering security questions when accessing my account
__label__1 It's great when you can get all of the information you need at one place. I recommend getting it if you have a card.
__label__1 Not much to say unless you are a discover card holder.  Its very easy to use and navigate your account.
__label__1 If you have a Discover card, this app allows you to do all of the essential things you need and want to do on their website. The UI is simple and straightforward.
__label__1 This app is great for accessing your discover account from your kindle.  It is everything you need in an app.  I have no complaints and would recommend it to anyone who has discover.
__label__1 this helps me keep track with all my spending and how i need to spend my money because i can check my account anytime online. i love it.
__label__1 Good app. Great for checking balances and making payments. Its free and convenient. Go ahead and download it. Its free.
__label__1 This app is a dream come true!Pros:1) Let's you make payments2) Shows you the statement Balances3) Let's you sign up for Cashback bonus offers4) Let's you redeem your bonus balance5) Let's you search through transactions, view account activity, past stat
__label__1 Convenient to use and easy to install.  This app makes checking my Discover balance and transactions extremely simple.  I would highly recommend this app.
__label__1 Already familiar with this website-based app for desktop computer use, I find most of the same features and usefulness in the Android mobile app version.
__label__1 With life on the go, it's nice to be able to check your balance and see if payments have posted to your account.
__label__1 Easy to use and great layout. Perfect app for what I want to do from a mobile device, which is to view account balances and make an occasional payment. Use on Kindle Fire and HTC Evo.
__label__1 great app. shows balance, transaction, and interest without errors on any of my devices. highly recommend for use by all A++
__label__0 Since this app did not work on my Kindle Fire HDX tablet it's easy and quick to rate a one star rating. The idea is very good, but I will have to continue using my bookmark to access Discover. I certainly would rate the app higher if it did function as i

__label__1 excellent news aggregator. This is a really wonderful app.EQUALLY AS good.as Feed Demon used to be for the PC. For those who love the news, get this app.
__label__1 Feedly is a great app that can find and organize a great deal of source materials into a slick format. I love how easy it is to brouse through news and blog entries on all of my favorite subjects on feedly.
__label__1 Feedly has changed my life! Without it, I may have been the last to hear about the SOPA Act, PIPA Act, ACTA Act, or Steve Jobs passing away. All of my mobile device have this app loaded. Smooth scrolling and the layout is elagant.

__label__1 I switched to Feedly when I learned that Google Reader was going away. This is an excellent replacement. I really liked the Google app and Freely took a bit of getting used to but for a free app I am impressed.
__label__1 This app has been delivering my daily reading material for a year now. It is simple, intuitive and beautiful.I recommend this to any Internet reader.
__label__1 I really enjoy having so much information at hand. I still don't really understand all that I can do with the app but I enjoy what Ican do.
__label__1 I love Feedly, it delivers all the information and updates I want from all my favorite sites. I like how fast and simple it is.
__label__1 I have been using Feedly for about 3 months now since the Google reader shut down. So far I like it better and have recommended it to several others. I'm very happy with this app!
__label__1 I've been trying to find a good way to keep up with my favorite websites, blogs and webcomics and this is it. It even organizes them across all my devices! I love this thing.
__label__1 This application is perfect for catching up with whatever RSS news feed you have. This is the perfect replacement to the stock Google Reader applies application.
__label__1 After some research of various news feeders I tested Feedly. After getting use to its format I soon learned to customize and add content to it. Transferring my subscriptions from my Google reader was painless and complete. I enjoy this Kindle version bec
__label__1 Feedly is a good app and I love how easy I can add pages or blobs I want to follow. would recommend using it.
__label__1 I came to Feedly via the Google Reader shutdown. I have been quite pleased with the result. I think I spend less time keeping up with my RSS reading than I used to, without missing anything. Feedly 's interface is easy to navigate on all platforms I use.
__label__1 I got the Feedly app to replace Google Reader and have been very impressed. It's easy to set up favorite categories,  mark entire sections as read, save favorites, and share reads via social media. Feedly is now my must read every day.
__label__1 I was despondent when Google Reader was retired.  Fortunately, I found Feedly.  The developers are constantly working to improve the app and are super responsive to the user comminuty.  I love this app.
__label__1 Awesome news reader works great on the Kindle Fireit's little like the Pulse reader.Also supports video's and lot's more.
__label__1 I have been using Feedly for some time, and I've been very pleased with it. Even though Google reader is going away, I won't even notice it's gone.
__label__1 I like to use my Kindle to catch up on my fav websites and this app is by far the best one I've tried.
__label__1 Still giving it a full run throught, but in my search to replace Google Reader this is what I came to.So far its pretty nice and easy to use.
__label__1 Kids complain too much!. New to readers?. This reader has &quot;a huge list of RS news feeds from around the world&quot;, it's formated to look great on Kindle Fire, has dark and light themes, and pleanty of options to customize to your very needs, and V
__label__1 I like so much this app because I can organize my blogs. The design is so good and I feel confortable using it. I did not knew this app because I was using google reader the I think I will use this app for long time.
__label__1 I had never used an RSS feed app before, but with all the news about Google Reader I went on a hunt for one. Feedly had good reviews so I tried it out. I love it! I can even add my own blog to share it easily in person. :)
__label__1 I've been playing with this app for some time on my tablet.  I like the magazine format fine. However on my tablet I kept getting lost going to the next page....accidentally closing the app or ending up in a different section than the one you were readin
__label__1 When Google announce that they will shut down reader I was worried, until I found feedly, simply the best google reader replacement, all the features from reader but in a beautiful package, and I love the today feature, if you liked reader, feedly is for
__label__1 So, I decided since Google decided to forgo their reader, I was going to just stop reading blogs. And, I did for a few months. But, I realized, I miss reading. I miss getting idea's for things to try in my home. Sure, there is Pinterest, and there is Fac
__label__1 Best way available to view google reader feeds now that reader itself is closing up shop. Magazine style and comfortable menus make for a very pleasing experience
__label__1 With the downfall of Google Reader Feedly really has taken up the thrown as an RSS aggregator. It's only continued to improve as the devs put more work into it.
__label__1 Feedly has become the go-to app for organizing RSS feeds since Google Reader took a dirt nap. Feedly is easy to organize, easy to look at and is great at saving stories for later. Give it a try while there's still a free version.
__label__1 I love my Kindle Fire for reading, and Feedly makes it even better. I can find many sources,and Feedly's magazine format makes it enjoyable to scan articles.
__label__1 I really cannot imagine a better way to stay current on what for me is a wide range of idiosyncratic topics. Using it on Kindle Fire Hd without any glitches.
__label__1 I had just started using Google's reader when i read an article (irony intended) that the reader was being phased out. With it came a recommendation for feedly (along with others). I was able to easily synch the 2 and then began using feedly exclusively.
__label__0 So many people raved about this that I just needed to check it out for myself. Everything is so superficial, it's like headline new lite. I don't want pages and pages of articles, but one or two sentences per topic seems a little silly. Maybe I'm not usi
__label__1 Good Bye Google Reader, I am so much happier with Feedly. I do not miss Google Reader, thanks to Feedly and DevHD.
__label__1 Since the loss of Google Reader I was at a loss and a gathering point for my news feed. The was a little battle of readers for a while but I'm glad I found feedly the interface is almost identical on all of my devices; iPhone 5, kindle fire, iMac and Mac
__label__1 My only complaint isn't really a complaint. I wish I could open more than one post at a time. Otherwise it's a near perfect app.
__label__1 Freely is absolutely the easiest way to access the many differing blogs I follow.  On my kindle, access is simple and fast.  I can organize the blogs by subject to maintain coherency.
__label__1 I had previously used Google reader and this is similar. It's easy to find blogs you want to follow in the search bar and add them to different categories. You can change the settings to customize it to your liking. The app itself is very professional lo
__label__1 I was upset after Google shut down Reader. I had read some good reviews on Feedly but saw some negatives saying it didn't sync with Feedly Cloud on the Fire version. I guess that was in the past because it works great now. I love that it syncs to my phon
__label__1 RSS feeds changed the way I used the internet 5-6 years ago and gave me a lot of my time back.  I am a Kindle loyalist and was looking for a good RSS reader.  I found Feedly and couldn't be happier.  It is perfect and does wverything I need it, too.  I c
__label__0 I used to use Feedly before Google acquired it but now in order to use the app it mandates signing in with a Google account.  I don't want to use Google and I can't save feeds I want to read locally on my phone so this is a useless app.
__label__1 Unless 1 of 2 things are true:youve paid for something else or have an irrational nostagic attachment to another podcast collector.  Great app, aggregates my podcasts in a coherent manner, and cut over from google reader was effortless.
__label__1 I love it...This is a great app for a person that likes to keep up with the latest news..Download it on kindle fire it works smooth
__label__1 Really love this app. It makes it really easy to see all the blogs I like to follow without having to go to my email and check them individually. I can quickly scroll through and see what I want to read more of or what I don't.
__label__1 If you used Google reader and were sad to see it go than this app is the answer for you.
__label__1 At the risk of sounding too dorky, this app is an essential for me. It only shows me links that I point it to and NO ADS. There is really nothing left to say, absolutely no down sides. I love it.
__label__1 I love that i can skim headlines and a blurb from various stories from various news sources all in one place. It also lets me know which are read or unread. Very convenient love it!
__label__1 Feedly has become the most-used app on my Kindle Fire. Nice, clean, modern interface for perusing news feeds. Love the swipe-based controls. Very nicely done.
__label__1 I really like Feedly as a replacement for Reader.  It is easy to sort through all my craft blogs and orgsnize then.  I like the thumbnail style main page also.
__label__1 I think the feedly app is far superior to the UI of the web version. I LOVE the swipe method of marking things as read or unread. This makes it so easy to follow all my newsfeeds.
__label__1 This reader is SO much better than Google's - Try it - you won't ever look for another RSS reader again.
__label__1 Just glad you were here when Google decided to split.. I have used this before Google disappeared and enjoy the layout. Works well on my Kindle Fire HD.
__label__1 I was sad to learn Google was ending Reader. I did what several million other Reader users did and easily transferred my subscriptions to Feedly. So far I'm satisfied with the switch.
__label__1 I had Feedly before. Didn't like it, so I removed it from my Kindle. But after repeated difficulties seeing Blogs I Follow on my Blogger dashboard, I decided to give Feedly another shot. I'm so glad I did.
__label__1 A real nice reader that is available on a wide variety of device s. Very fast and easy-to-use.  Works quite well on the kindle no glitches. Built in browser works excellent and is easy and intuitive to use.
__label__1 Ever since Google reader was shut down I have looked for a substitute for it. After trying many Feed Readers, I have settled on this as my replacement.
__label__0 This app is always crashing on a Kindle Fire HDX 8.9. It's it the Kindle? Is it the app? I don't know, but considering how frequently it happens, I'm inclined to believe the latter. As it is, it's almost unusable.
__label__1 I was not familiar with RSS feeds until today. That's that little orange logo that looks like a wi-fi symbol that you see on just about every web page thats important to you. Feedly is beautiful and user friendly. Displays nice windows that slide up/down
__label__1 Better than Google Reader. It's able to present news in a much better format. Feedly also organizes the articles better.
__label__0 Cannot log into Google account from the latest Kindle Fire. Waste of time downloading this app. Disappointing to say the least.
__label__1 Works in Chrome, Android, and Kindle. Feedly will replace the syncing back end when Google kills Reader in a few months. +1
__label__1 This feed reader is very fast and has a clean appearence.It looks like your running Windows 8.  It is very easy to customize and gives you the option to tweet, post on Facebook, or email an article.  You can even set up an email list.  After reading an a
__label__1 I have been using this service ever since google reader was retired. It took a little while, but I have gotten used to the interface and other unique features. This is definitely the best app/website combo I have seen for reading res feeds.
__label__1 Works well, stable and fast. Easy to use. The only complaint is it will not let me paste an address in the add content area to add a feed like I can in a web browser.
__label__1 I've tried all the major players - Google reader, pulse, netvibes, pageflakes, taptu, easy rss, etc.  In my opinion, Feedly is by far the best news aggregator. It's also one of the only ones that works on your phone, tablet, AND the desktop.
__label__1 There are a number of blogs I like to check on regularly, but since I am often doing so from my Fire or my Smart Phone, rather than my desktop, it is great to have the Feedly app available in all three places so that I can check in whenever I have a few 
__label__1 Organization is great.Easy to add blogs to your feed.Keeps all recent posts upfront.No issues linking to the actual site.Great replacement for Google Reader.
__label__1 I switched to feedly from Google reader because it was being discontinued. Best thing to happen! I love feedly, and this app allows me to check a all of the blogs I follow easily on my Kindle Fire.
__label__1 This app works and looks amazing on the HP Touchpad.  Looks perfect and utilizes the HD screen of a HP Touchpad.  Great Job.  All my Google Reader content in a beautiful layout.  Also plays video and podcast within the app.
__label__1 Only what I want, not what someone else thinks I want.I dumped newshog after they added annoying ads, and so glad, feedly is superior.
__label__1 A recommended replacement for Google Reader. It has always worked perfectly for me on my Kindle Fire. Easy to organize, so if you are organized, you can find what you're looking for with not much effort.
__label__1 I love Feedly. It's the first thing I open on my Kindle to catch all the current headlines and decide which ones I want to go deeper into!
__label__1 Have used this  before and I love it . They made my transition from Google easy and seamless, loads up and opens so you can enjoy. Thanks bill
__label__1 I've been a loyal user of Google Reader until it was retired. And soon after, I've become so used to Feedly that it has become my new RSS reader.
__label__1 Had to get a replacement for google reader because good had the nerve to close reader down. I moved over to feedly and it made the loss much less painful. the only suggestion is I miss searching through just my feeds
__label__1 I found this as a suggestion to replace Google Reader, and I wish I knew aboit it sooner. It is a fantastic RSS Reader with great features and enough flash to it to make it look slick without overdoing it. I like that it syncs accross all devices so when
__label__0 I never got to see what it was about. I tried to dl the app but a message came back as corrupt.if they fix the problem I'll be happy to try downloading again.
__label__0 This app sucks. It is very inaccurate, and it only tests you on recognizing patterns. I wasn't expecting much, but this was worse than expected.
__label__1 I have no idea how it really compares to other IQ Tests of any kind. I took my test at 11:30pm on my new Kindle Fire HD and surprised myself.  May take it again when I am bright eyed and more awake.  Really read or review each test item.  Think beforeyou
__label__0 This did not test intelligence.  It is basically a math test for spatial problems.  A true IQ test tests for all ranges of knowledge.  Glad I didn't have to pay for this one.
__label__1 I took the test and I was not happy with my score so I tried again and I came up!  So I wanted to test my family and one by one we all score about the same. Until my son with adhd played, he scored higher than us all. Well can you imagine what that did f
__label__0 It doesn't even have a valid way of testing your knowledge. It only tests on math and language arts, not even science. It is mostly questions such at &quot;what comes next in the pattern.&quot; If you aren't good with those like me, it will grade you ver
__label__0 Can not zoom, hard to read, too small letters and graphics on the 7&#34; fire. I do not know if they are more readable on larger tablets, but it was not fun with the 7&#34; fire.Dump it.
__label__1 Especially since I am exhausted and haven't been using my analytical thinking skills lately.  It's a lower score than I got the last time I took an official IQ test, but that was many years ago. The questions are what I would have expected, and I don't s
__label__0 I thought that this would be a mindless test, like a stupidity test but it actually requires a pen and paper to do some of the math problems I deleted it right away
__label__1 I am so relieved to find out that I have a mind and it is actually working!  Seriously, this is a fun way to find out if your brain is atrophied after being retired!
__label__1 Decent enough app that is exactly what it says it is, an iq test. I can't speak for how accurate it is but I had no problems at all downloading or using it on a 2nd gen kindle fire. My main reason for writing this review was to try to (at least to a smal
__label__1 this is amazing. it tests my IQ and I'm going to meed that. any way this is great for all ages. from 4 or 5 and up untill it dies. well you know what I mean. this is a smart app and should be more that free. its so good I think teachers could use it to t
__label__1 Great tool to sit back and keep your mind connected with hands and eyes. This is one of my favorites.
__label__0 who ever is the twisted foul mouthed sicko who made this!!! I have one sentence for u: how do u even call this funny!?!?!? is this how u get your sick kicks!?!?!? omg get a life dude!?!? DO NOT GET!!!!!!
__label__0 this app talks about sexual stuff and o gave it to my son and he asked me what is s3x? so this app Is so inoproprite not for children under 16
__label__0 hellooooo i havent even got this yet but i usally look at reviews before i get them and who ever made this game is sick and gross and this is NOT aceptable. i voted this app a one star because u cant vote no stars. bad. very bad. super bad.
__label__0 Both truths and dares are for people at least age eighteen. This is not a family game, and the questions are actually related to things that can be offensive as well. Questions are repetitive.
__label__0 I downloaded this app thinking it would be really fun to play with my family. but when we started playing, it had inappropriate questions. so we went and changed the questions, and we played. but when we went and played it again, it went back to the inap
__label__0 Thought this game would be fun to do with the grandchildren...NOPE...is an ADULT game.  I am still trying to get it deleted. Even as an adult...I found it offensive.
__label__0 I don't think you would want to buy thisvapp cause it ks crap so don't buy it if you want to wear a thing's!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
__label__0 worst game in the world and the dares are the worst just like the truths! this app stinks! DO NOT GET THIS STUPID APP!
__label__0 I'm 11 and its not approate for me and my friends there are some nasty words in it dont get it if u r my age.
__label__0 What the heck, its truth or dare, its supposed to be funny!!! Talking about this crap is stupid. Not many answers either, only like 5 or 6..... very disappointed!!!
__label__0 I hate it haves bad words and I'm 10 didn't get it. it has one thing it says to have sex with a player.
__label__1 This is a lot of fun. It comes with preset truths and dares. You can also add truths and dares. You get to pick truth or dare. Its a lot of fun when you have a group of people.
__label__0 So my friend came over and she said hi. Anyhow I was looking 4 a truth if dare app. Then I found this piece of bS it was full of dirty stuff like beer and sex. This game is some  serious cheddar. DO NOT GET! NOT WORTHY IF ONE STAR! EWWW!And my friend als
__label__0 this is really innapropriate for children! All I had to do was look at the 3rd picture and it has some extremly bad and hurtful things! DO NOT GET THIS APP! I repeat DO NOT GET THIS APP!!!!
__label__0 This game is horrible and innapropriate. It is absolutely the worst and I hate it. No one shouldnhave to go up to someone and say " what does this mean?" To play a game of truth or dare. So how about this. Truth or dare. Truth. This game is messed up. Tr
__label__0 this is the most non kid app everI cant believe this app I was lookingfor a app I could play at a sleep over with some of myfriends and I'm 16 this is still bad for my agepeoples pleas make some good Truth OR Dare APPS
__label__0 I bought this game on my kindel fire I'm 8 I bought it thinking it would be fun well it's. not I showed it to my 5year old sister guess what she asked me what sex means. some of the questions are drink a beer remove all clothing and make a toilet paper s
__label__0 i do not reccomend this app it is not for kids one of my dares was &quot;chug a beer&quot; so dont get this app unless your 21or older
__label__0 this truth or dare game sucks!! it is NOT for kids under 18 and it repeats the same thing over and over and over again!!!
__label__0 this is a horrible game all bad.IF YOU ARE A KID DONT GET THIS. BAD GAME. I wanted to play truth or dare.
__label__0 Tuck! Don't get this game unless you want to be very grossed out. Like this one time I picked truth it said do you where a thong? I hate this game.
__label__0 please don't get this app if you have kids that will play with your phone!!! look at the questions and you will see what I am talking about! The one near the bottom is the question that turned me off about getting this app. this is nasty!
__label__0 i started to play with my friends not knowing it was a terrible and sick app then we started it and it freaked and grossed us all out DO NOT GET THIS APP!!!!!!! I REPEAT DO NOT GET IT!!!!!
__label__0 this app sucks don't get it!!!!! you wont do what the dares are and wont say what the truths arw
__label__0 I'm ten year old. I thought this was a fun game for kids it isn't. don't get this app unless youare 18+. some of the things it said was do you wear a thong? where was the weirdest place you had sex? give someone a lap dance. this app is totally perverted
__label__0 I am a young woman.and I wanted a fun game to play with friends. Not something gross. This asks you all these privet inaproperate things. If your young and want a good Truth and Dare, skip THIS! Unliss you want to talk about girlfriend / boyfriend. stuff
__label__0 I was looking at this app.. I looked at the second picture and I knew my mom would've flopped.. badly .. omg I was grosser out! I would've been grounded for a User thts how bad this is..
__label__0 I got this game because I thought this one looked more like a truth or dare for KIDS... I should had looked at the reviews! this game is gross! not a game kids should play. think before you buy.........THINK!!!
__label__0 this app is very innapropriate and invasive! &quot;do you wear thongs&quot;? what's the wierdest place you have had s*x&quot;? have u ever had an orgasm? very innapropriate, and even if you delete all of them and put in ur own, its still not that great!!
__label__0 So weird. It has stuff like: Do you wear a thong?That's gross and discusting! I should not even rate his any stars. Please! Don't buy.
__label__1 Who would have guessed Kindle Fire has no option for cleaning your contact list easily!?! I thought I was going to have to clean my close to 1,000 entry contact list one item at a time. This was such a huge help to me. In just minutes my contact list was
__label__1 The Kindle contact manager is abysmal. Every other android device properly syncs with Google Contacts. At least the Kindle provides an import contacts capability to get minimal contact information but it duplicates contacts with prefixes (like Dr. or Pas
__label__1 Easy to use and did exactly what I needed,  Even though I may only need it once, I'm not getting rid of it because I might need it again someday.
__label__0 so this thin was a waste of time and download...uselessdeleted it soon as I saw how it works..meaning it doesnt work for people with google contacts.
__label__1 Not only does it deliver as promised but it has one of the best looking font faces on an app you'll ever visualize. To bad you'll only see it for a few seconds tops as the app does its thing in flick of a moment.  Instructions noting the exception where 
__label__1 This is a really nice game with a good bonus. The bonus round comes up pretty often. The first time i played this game, I got the bonus round over 10 times and my balance was over $900,000. If only it was real money. I wish!!!
__label__1 the buck is well worth it easy to use graphics are ok. this is the one and only slot machine app i use regularly pokie magic definitely struck gold on this app i repeat get this app you will love it
__label__1 Love this slot game.  Fun to play, have had no problems with it on my kindle fire. Like the two types of bonus rounds.
__label__1 Game and graphics are really nice on my Kindle Fire. Again, if you like slot games you won't be sorry if you get this one. The payout is good so it makes the game fun.
__label__1 I love this game.  It is one of my favorites.  I have recommended it to several of my friend .  They like it.
__label__1 Good game.  Graphics are beautiful and it's fun to play.  Easy to get lots of points.  Always mute the sound so don't know how that is.
__label__1 Great game. Best part is they do not rip you off having to actually buy coins.  No problems at all on my kindle.
__label__1 Really like the Pokie Magic games. It's a lot of fun. This game is very colorful and changes when things could get boring.
__label__1 Love it!  Love it!  Love it!  My family and I play is whenever we can.  Everything about this game is fun, and it was free!  I would recommend it to anyone who likes slot machines. The sounds, music and visuals are great.  Glad I went for it.
__label__1 This game is really cool and the fire breathing dragon is pretty awesome and the payouts are the BEST and I like the bonus games
__label__1 Downloaded to my Fire Kindle and worth the $0.99 cents. Played other Slots but this one is the best. Sounds &amp; Graphics are good.
__label__1 In real casinos, one of my favorite slot machines is the Fire Dragon.  This game put out by Pokie Magic simulates the real thing!  I have fun playing it at night in bed, always trying to get the bonus before I turn off the light.  Knowing that I've made 
__label__1 PROS:  Well worth the 99 cents for the hours of fun it has given me.  There are no pop-up ads asking you to buy something else, like there are in most of the free games, that alone makes it worth the 99 cents.  It pays out very frequently.  In the game o
__label__1 I have been playing this game for a long time now and I enjoy it.  It is always fun to play and see what will happen. I started playing this game on my I-touch  and I now have it on my kindle .
__label__1 This cracked screen prank is pretty realistic. It has a lot of choices for what kind of crack you want, and the size of the crack. It's easy to use, and you can even use other apps while the crack is still on the screen. Very satisfying, good job!
__label__1 i loved it because it totally scared my sister cuz she actually thought i broke it lol :) u should get it also
__label__1 I love this app the first week I got my kindle fire I did this app and my dad flipped out I mean he was going nuts untill I should him wat it realy was it was halerious
__label__0 froze my kindle fire and couldn't exit. most Likly it has a bug that will freeze/ruin your phone never get it!
__label__1 I fooled my friends with the crystal leak some have to high of graphics so they don't look good but this is an amazing app.
__label__1 I like this app. 9/9 modes totally creeped out my mom.The cracks look real and you can control the size and stuff.
__label__1 This prank works better than I actually expected it to. I try to remember to set it whenever someone asks to borrow my phone or if I have to show someone something on it. The look on their face is priceless!
__label__0 this game stinks it freezes and it really breaks. it doesn't even have good grafics don't get it its horrible
__label__1 I like ot its fun scared the heak out of my mom with it so if u like pranks get this app
__label__1 This app works as described. If you want a realistic looking &quot;broken&quot; phone, this is a good free app. Good for someone who always borrows your phone. What did you do to my phone!!! lol
__label__1 This app rocks and my dad freaked out when he saw my screen.This app is a must have.It is always on even when you turn off the app so it looks so real.Great for April Fools day!If you want a good prank get this app!
__label__0 I wouldn't never get this app. It's to big! If I were u I would get it on my phone it will look a lot better than on a kindle. Everyone is saying it's not cool I got it they are right. I am eight and I no what I am talking about. :-}
__label__0 warning.watching this will haunt you for life.do not buy u will wish u didn't.I do so if u buy u will be like this :O wtf is this but if u don't buy u will be like : ) I'm glad I didnt

__label__0 I hate this game it's HORRIBLE it's not what I expected it's just gross!no one get this game it just wastes your time!
__label__0 this would totally be a zero if it could be one. l mean really who would pay for the full version of this please don't install this. But if u do you'll probably end up deleting it anyway.
__label__0 I cant even use this on my kindlefire! Its too big to do and you get bored of it in 3 seconds. In fact, you dont even like it
__label__0 don't get this app. weird mouths that uses its tounge  to much. freky. don't get this app at all I mean it. I would give it a 0 if I could.
__label__0 You might as well just fork over .99&cent; for the full version because it's not good. Even the full version sucks. There are honestly many many more of the mouth apps that you can get and they have hundreds of face to use. PLUS this one only has a few. 
__label__0 I would give this app 0 stars if I could but apparently that is not an option.  so if you read this don't waste your time with this app.
__label__0 there is an app for iPod touches and smartphones called juicy fruit sweet talk and it shows similar things. but the mouths say funny things instead of blowing raspberries. this stinks for kindle fire. its cheesy and looks like a bunch of teens made it up
__label__0 This app is a waste of space. It sucks. &gt;_&lt; If you try to get this it is a waste of space.
__label__0 sucks on a kindle fire because the kindle is huge and it'll look funny ( but not 4 u ) it really sucks
__label__1 best thing ever it has lips mouths I like ducks well. your ordinary bun and thyes. you need buns and thyes to live if you don't have this app too bad just downlaod it don't listen to those crazy peeps who say this awesome thing is disturbing really its n
__label__0 This app SUCKS. I wouldn't recommend it for anyone. I deleted it the first time I tried it! I hate it go away from it.
__label__0 this is just plain sick!!!!! why would would any one want to pay for the full version. this is bad enough and its free!
__label__0 This app is very lame and it i  not fun. There is really no choices of which mouth you want to choose and they are really boring. Please listen to me and don't ever get this game!
__label__0 I looked at the app and hey pretty funny right? I was wrong. I opened it and omg it was freakish. it gave me the hibba bajibas!!!! aka the chills.... scary!!!!
__label__1 it is amazing those ideats are stupid. just listen it also co.es free faces just try it plz if you get your a very nice person. to be nice to the company

__label__0 It's creepy to big for a kindle fire dumb worst app I ever got like this is horrible don't get this on a kindle fire it's stupid on that device (unless you have a huge mouth)
__label__0 this app is terrible! it just a bunch of videos of other peoples mouths, nasty! just a waste of time and space!
__label__1 First let me say that I normally do not play games like this...I play games like words with friends and such...having said that...since the first day I downloaded this app on my kindle fire I have been addicted....the ways you can design are almost unlim
__label__0 this app is completely stupid. I don't mean to b rude, but that's the truth.  it gives you no directions on how to do anything, and you have to pay SSSOOOOOOOO MUCH for everything not even including real money. for example, you have to pay 10 gems just t
__label__1 I love this app it is awesome. it is free and super fun. u can get lots of animals and crops and isn't hard at all!!!  its like a real farm!!!!!!  ::-)))))))  &lt;3.
__label__0 these apps are horrible and a rip off! you have to pay for everything and they have been raising prices! do not get this app.
__label__1 Downloaded this app and I love it! Convinced all my friends to add it too. So easy to add all my Storm8 friends!
__label__1 I love this app because first I'm nineteen and I got it for my little sister but find myself playing it to sometimes my little sis takes away my kindle at 10 at night or in the mornings to play farm story shaloves it
__label__0 Team Lava. And Farm Story are ONLY about MONEY. You can't buy with out jewels and it take money for jewels. THEN jewels are TAKEN back, or disappear without your knowledge, and then Team Lava will not replace.
__label__1 best app ever i love it its soo much its soo adictive in a good way. you should sooo get this app.
__label__1 My granddaughter wanted this and loves it. She loves choosing the products to plant and then when ready picking them.
__label__1 this game passes time away and is very addictive. it is way better than farmville. I would recommend. it to any who has a lot of time on their hands.
__label__1 I absolutely love this!  Move on over farmville.  I love this game because I have problems loading farmville on m computer.  Farm story is very similar but so much easier and runs smoother.  AWESOME GAME!
__label__1 it's additive! reminds me of mafia wars from myspace. I play all day if I could trying to get gems do I can buy more stuff
__label__1 It's easy and so addicting.  Great free app.  Definitely recommend for all ages.  No problems ever.  It's fun talking with other farmers all over the world.
__label__1 This is great for kids young and old :-) but I think the little ones it is great to let them play it .I tried it and it is fun. The little ones will love it .
__label__0 1st most of the stuff cost gems which u need 2 buy with real money.2nd its super boring,no goals,no nothing.What ever u do don't get this game!
__label__1 Great game! It works great on my Kindle Fire. It is a a lot of fun. It is my favorite game that I have.
__label__0 I tried it cause I like Hay Day app for iPhone.  Nothing like it!  This app sucks big time!  Don't recommend.
__label__0 i like the game but suddenly it force closes all the time.  it was fun for until it started to do that. please fix!
__label__0 There is a rare moment in farm story without having to use gems. Almost everything that you can buy costs you gems, and the 10 they give you to start can't buy a tomato, even. (I'm being literal). In fashion story and farm story, the average fir gems you
__label__0 I tried this game and found it too juvenile for my tastes.  I deleted it after about 10 minutes.  This would be a great kid game on a long trip.
__label__1 This game is awesome I don't know why people complain about spending real money. I don't, and my farm is just fine so when u play this game my storm id is: fablehaven87
__label__1 I really like this farm game it keeps you interested and you can meet others farms and neighbors and you can have trees, animals and crops to make money to get more of what you want.
__label__1 Love playing this game, fun to watch the crops grow. You get to visit other players farm and help  Water the crops.
__label__1 So fun. I highly recommend it to you. I played it for at least a half hour straight. I don't have much money, but I'm planning to buy a tool shed for a house. It's the cheapest.  Wow. I could spend all this time telling you HOW fun it is.
__label__1 this is a very fun game and it is even better because I have a kindle fire very very good game
__label__1 I love this app. It works great on the Kindle Fire, and addictive. I am 11 and have not slipped up on accidently buying any gems. It does ask to buy gems, just hit cancel, and brush past it. Add me Pitbullocer.  :)
__label__1 awesome. game . I need some nieghbors.I play everyday. You can add me. Name is anoldog.I love playing this game. I play it everyday.Just starting though and need neighbors. You can add meanoldog.
__label__1 This game is great. If you are careful and read what all the pop-ups say you won't spend any money on accident.
__label__1 I love being able to farm on my Android. I loved Farmville on Facebook and I wanted a farming game that didn't require a login.
__label__1 This is super cool. THE BEST GAME EVA!!! I can't believe they made such an awesome game. Over well worth the price. But people, don't raise the price! Peeps need to see how awesome this is.
__label__0 It's an alright game. The annoying thing is that there are no notifications for this, so you either have to time how long it will take your crops to harvest for find some other work around, which is a huge inconvenience because I don't want all these ext
__label__1 I love how I can pick out my own crops to grow. plus all the stuff I can get. I wish there was an farm story 2.  so I can build an even better farm.
__label__1 UPDATE: 2/27/12  Now that I've played the game for about a month I thought it deserved all five stars.  You can actually have a decent farm without having to pay real money for the gems.  Just takes a lot of planting and harvesting.  The game is a lot of
__label__1 Absolutely addicted. There are lots of cool items almost weekly. Get to meet many great people  from  all over. On it almost  everyday!!.
__label__1 This is my favorite game out of the team lava games for the kindle fire.works really well and is not a boring game. u don't have to buy anything with real money unless you want to.... rate &#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;stars....
__label__1 I don't. like it when you have to have friends to expand your business. but other then that very nice relaxing game for me to play
__label__1 this is the best game I have ever down loaded I promise I have played this for like one year and will never get tired
__label__1 Awesome app and when you get it add amyacdc to your neighboors. And loo for a awesome girl called Kayla!
__label__1 This game is adictive. but after a while It gets boring then fun then boring then fun. so this game is awesome
__label__1 I love this game. Everybody is so nice to me on here no one is mean to me. This is the best game ever. Dont get Fashion Story ever THERE R BULLIES ON THERE. GET THIS GAME!!!!!
__label__0 each story game has its own little problems but farm story is the most boring. first off it takes forever to earn money and even then you earn a profit of about 100 coins so it takes so long to move on in the game. I simply couldn't get into it because i
__label__1 love it the animals are really cute and the trees get you lots of coins. I have all except nightclub story
__label__1 Heeyy waz uuppp its me again now listen up I have got something to say I LOVE THIS GAME!!!! U know I wish  you could like crossbreed plants that would be sooooooo cool!!!! like a pinelily you know a lily and a pineapple. I am such a thinker;) so all toge
__label__1 love my farm glad i have it on my kindle fire play with my sister my best friend and my dad who all live out of my state
__label__1 Both myself and my 5 year old granddaughter have fun with this! Itis a great learning tool for h e r!!!!!
__label__1 I love farm story. its a fun game where you have your own farm, neighbors to water, and a wall where everyone can post comments on.
__label__1 this app is fun but if you wait too long to pick up your crops it withered and then you have to plant them all over again
__label__1 It works great on my Kindle Fire, but you have to have a Internet access which I don't see why?? Other than that, this app is extremely awesome.
__label__1 This game is great! Not only do my sons love it, but I find myself checking on the farm every day. It is comparable to the other story games by Team Lava. We have them all on our Kindle Fire and think they are all very fun.
__label__1 fun game that can really draw u in. kid safe, it is pretty much farmville except with out facebook!!!! I found it a little frusterating at all the items that costs a ton of gems ( which are really hard to get unless u are willing to pay real money for so
__label__1 This game really fun to play, especially when you don't have anything else to do. You can plant crops that can take anywhere from 1 minute to 3 days. This game has pretty good graphics and works really good on the kindle fire. I strongly recommend this g
__label__1 I do love this game already and haven't even had it a whole day. stayed up all night already playing it.
__label__1 I love this game, I'm totally addicted!! I love building up my very own place. I play all the story games, so if you need neighbors feel free to add me, necianokomis.

__label__0 This looks like an interesting game but it wasn't the one my friends play so I switched over to another one..
__label__1 I have been having lots of fun with this trying to build the farm.  Going slow right now, but I am gaining a few items as I go along.  Lots of fun.  Great app, try it.
__label__1 This is a very fun farming version like farmville! I love the animal sounds, the large choice of crops, trees, and decorations.
__label__1 Awesome and fun to play!  Only thing I hate is when you upload must delete old :(  Other than that great game!
__label__1 awesome game!!! I enjoy makeing my own farms!!!!! great for the fire ;) play ever day!! fav game love it
__label__1 I finish loading the game and started playing. I am totally hooked. I play this game on and off all day. It helps me to relax and calm down totally. My grandchildren love helping me to pick out plants to grow. I'm very happy that I bought me a Kindle Fir
__label__1 this app was cool. you can talk with friends and have ur very own farm. i would reccomend getiing this app!!
__label__1 love this game I have fashion story and club story and this one add me on all if u have them chanel1000 but yeah this game is so fun and addictive I have a kindle fire and they work great on them and I don't buy the gems ( just saying)
__label__0 This app is terrible.  I am very disappointed.  You have to buy gems and is a very poor knockoff of Farmville!!
__label__1 This game rocks it is a awesome game who ever likes farming will love this game a lot. You can plant just almost anything.
__label__0 You can't do anything in this game unless you have gems. But at the beggining of the game. it forces you to spend all your gems. The only way to get gems is to buy them. 5gems cost. 10 dollars. If you don't spend real money. you can't progress or even pl
__label__1 Great time killer. No crop stealing just fun! \nMake new friends by getting neighbors. Water your neighbors crops and send them gifts. \n\n
__label__1 I love this game! Its very addictive and fun for anybody! But it requires patience and thinking, over all its a very cool game:) I recommend it!!!!
__label__1 Farm story runs very smooth on the kindle fire.  It gives you an option of having nieghbors or not.  great for younger players also.
__label__1 hello my name is BORING this game has no life LOL just kidding this app is great for kindle HD so buy it down load it whatever JUST GET IT but beware you might have to pay ppl some mola
__label__1 Like pretending to grow and harvest without having to really get dirty? Do you enjoy touring other people's gardens, doing them favors and getting presents in return? This game is totally addictive. Players grow crops but can also plant fruit and nut tre
__label__0 am i the only one getting force closed on kindle this morning? did I miss an update? will give more stars later.
__label__1 i wouldnt say i LOVE it but close. its a good game you can play your way...dont want to wait 16hrs for a plant? just plant Rasberries and Strawberries! with a 1min and 5min timer you dont have to wait all day to start earning money and experience!
__label__1 it is a realy cool game and you don't need to spend money on it the only problem that there is is that it can foreclose some times but you only have to restart your kindle
__label__1 so now I am addicted to all but one of the story games. lord help me if they make another one.
__label__1 I love pet shop story and city story and night club story.so I must love farm story.true true your.your right if you said I liked it.well what I'm trying to say is I really think you should get it.Hope you. like it - EVIL PUG GIRL
__label__1 slit of people are saying that to advance you have to buy gems but you don't. My friend is level 87 and he hasn't bought anything you just need coins to play , gems are for things that are extra. the game is really fun you make your own farm and can be s
__label__1 I LOVED this game!!!! Although the gems can cost money, coins are easy to earn and you can decorate your farm any way you want! Name your farmer, and plow your way through the game! You can also make a storm8 id-mine is champvisits- and make neighbors! c
__label__0 You start with a small field and must expand. your expansion also includes any decorations, animals or buildings, so things stay in this weird square shape. did not enjoy it
__label__1 I love this game it is berry easy to do and you don't have to pay for anything in the game.
__label__1 This game has the same parental control as the others.  So great that.It rates higher for there is no lost money or issues with earning.Just a fun, relaxing game.Christine

__label__1 I love Farm Story, I don't however, love spending my hard earned money on things like broken tractor signs!  You all should be ashamed  charging 24 gems for garbage. I have been wanting the floating island that is beautiful, the tree hammock that's adora
__label__0 ive never been a fan of teamlava games for at least 2 reasons.1. ITS EXPENSIVE!!! you need to buy aton of things with real money which is real expensive.2. Its boring. I played this game for 3 days and it got seriously boring with the adds and they kept 
__label__1 farm story is a lot of fun.  love it. it is a great way to keep in touch with some of your friends who are also playing

__label__0 I didn't like this game one bit. I felt it was borrringg and thank gosh it was free cuz the reviews were so good I woulda bought it. leave it to me to have da only negative comment
__label__1 I love this game. Always have. You can plant flowers, fruit, vegetables, wheat, odd crops and trees. They have lots of decorations. But for some reason have not given new decorations since November 2013. They used to do this once a week. Please update te
__label__1 I have Farm Story on my kindle fire and it is amazing. Sure u can spend real $ but u don't have to because its really easy to earn coins and gems. All u have 2 do is plant crops and trees then master them
__label__1 I only wish our farm ran this efficiently! I like sitting in my recliner, raising crops etc. and only moving my finger!
__label__0 all you do is plant...... and wait for it to grow, nothing to build, nothing else to collect.... just boring
__label__1 I've been playing for 4 years now, it's a great way to meet interesting people From around the world. There's a wide variety of crops, flowers, trees to plant and many animals. You DON'T need to spend a dime on this AWESOME game.KEEP FARMING  ~:0)&trade;
__label__1 I play this game every day its a whole lot better than the game on facebook. u don't need to worry about energy or side quests to keep ur farm going. get the dog bowls and resell for big bucks.
__label__1 I love this game. You can use real money but you do not have to I don't. I still love all the stuff you can get without the gems. Also you can password protect your device so your kids cant spend your hard earned real money.
__label__1 I was pleased when I found you do not have to purchase any coins to play and advance you can purchase diamonds for special items but no need you can acquire neighbours without hitting facebook.... that is a plus for me.....hours of fun as nd great graphi
__label__0 It's a boring copy cat of Hay Day.  Animation is poor and does the same thing over and over.  Not for anyone over 5
__label__1 collect different animals and etc. You don't have to buy anything. the buying gems option is optional. You earn money by growing and selling your crops. The option to buy gems with real money is kind of for the ppl who dont like to wait to expand their f

__label__0 eh this game is ok but it lagged on me a lot I don't like much. Well lets just say ... what's the word ... ah stupid.I hate it its crapy. Don't get it whoever says its cool and awesome their liying because its dumb.
__label__0 Take a nice friendly game with positive activities and absolutely RUIN it with their gem traps designed to STEAL your inapp purchase content.  Why cant they let you spend the gems on things you want?  There are constant tricks everywhere to pick your poc
__label__1 Great game to pass some time with. Lots of options for different crops and decorations. Really like the social aspect of the game.
__label__1 It is fun. A cute little game that makes boredom go away. Its creators also made restaurant story; bakery story; and pet shop story.

__label__0 in order to get some of the advanced options , you would need to spend a bunch of real money (to buy gems), since you can't earn the gems.  If you are willing to spend the money, then you can create some cool looking farms, otherwise this game is pretty

__label__1 I don't write reviews unless I REALLY enjoy the item so this one is a keeper! You really don't need any real money to play if you're willing to be a good farmer &amp; have some patience. Set the in-app controls so you don't  lose anything by accident. My

__label__1 Awesome game. fun plz check in closely. Pie Pie Pie loo loo loo loo Pol loo lol just random stuff
__label__0 You have to wait long on your crops and ive been hearing reviews that kids have been purchasing &quot;gems&quot; with real money... Amazon your great for giving refunds.I honestly say this game is boring. My opinion. Thanks for reading.
__label__1 great game to play on your wifi time. it keeps you busy and great on designing a farm much like famville also
__label__0 this game sucks. not because of  the game play but because they have not fixed the bugs.save your phone space for something else.

__label__0 My problem with this game is I have had to uninstall it three times for it stopped working and to expand you have to have others who play

__label__1 This game is really fun. I love the graphics and all the little animals you can get. I highly recommend it for any age!
__label__1 This game is truly remarkable to me. I play it everyday and get so addicted to it. You don't have to give out personal information which is a plus. Don't worry so much about gems! In fact, you don't even have to buy them. In some instances, you get free 
__label__1 I love this game:-) I met a lot of new friends. Its a lot of fun and its a lot of work too. I love it get it.
__label__1 I've been playing this game for a while now and it's been more fun than I thought it would be. Especially if you have a lot of active friends who water your crops and send gifts.
__label__1 I play this on my Kindle Fire HD 7 inch screen. No problems fun game sometimes it gets stuck I got 30 something 32gb so I don't know why it get sticks oh well
__label__1 This app is awesome and it lets you farm like you are a real farmer it lets you post and water your friends farm!  love it!!!
__label__1 good fun if you like these games. just like farmville. it don't take long to build this farm. I love it.
__label__1 this app is extremely fun.Oh and by the way you don't need gems to play. I play without gems and it is great.
__label__1 this game is 99% addictive... flawless ~ if you want a 100% addictive game check out tap zoo.. totally fun I love games like this!! make more!!
__label__0 when I found this app it looked like it would be fun so I purchased it. right away it was sooooooo boring I definitely would not share this app with a friend. do not get this app.
__label__1 this is probably my favorite game I have so far its tons of fun, you get to make a lot of money, grow crops, decorate ur farm, talk to friends and visit other farms. soo much fun. I really enjoy it. so will u
__label__1 Promised myself I wouldn't spend money on this game but it's so much fun and worth it!  (and you don't actually have to spend money....impatient people like me do though)
__label__0 omg I am so sick of this game I use to love it but I had 9 story games and now don't play this game people like me have used gems and I thought u buy them with the u know the coins but I spent 300$ and I didn't know
__label__1 This is a great app, especially if you're a on the go type of person. Not only addicting, but social, too! Make sure you friend or &quot;neighbor&quot; larsona
__label__1 im 10 and  i LOVE THIS APP EBEN MY SISTER WHO IS 13!!!! WE BOTH LOVE THIS APP this is worth it get this app!!!!
__label__0 Kindle Fire - I didn't even play this game.  I noticed, after I downloaded it, that real money is used to advance in this game.  Unless you want to pay for a free app, stay away from this one.
__label__1 Hiking I think that farm story is the best app in the world. At first I had no clue what this game was and thought itwould be dumb but when I downloaded it it turned out to be awesomly awesome!!!!!! I give it... &#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733; FIVE S
__label__1 eThis game is so cool. The raspberrys are free to plant. I repeat they are free I tell you free.
__label__1 fun app great. and easy it takes long to download though but still fun oh ya JUST DONT BUY GEMS THEN
__label__0 This was one of my favorite games.. but team lava you have a one star and i will not buy gems until you remove tap to manage for ios users and let us delete &quot;Stormies farm&quot; or at least be honest about it.. I really enjoy this game but recent bu
__label__1 BEST APP EVERED PLAYED. I LOVE IT. WOSH THEY WILL MAKE ZOO SYORY. BUT IT STILL IS AWESOME. GET IT GET IT GET IT!!!!!!!
__label__1 I just love the great games Team Lava has for customers who love FREE games. I recommend this game to all of you have enjoyed their other games.
__label__1 Keeps ongoing. Crops grow you pick and I keep going. Trying to be self sefishent and spent ne real money
__label__1 DONT ADD ME but id is lizzy8989 all story games are awesome but this is the awsomest one tip: DONT BUY GEMS
__label__0 like many other games, your play is limited unless you actually pay for things. otherwise this app gets boring REALLY quick. try Zoo Club instead. much more fun, and you don't have to pay.
__label__1 Addicting! You find yourself very caught up in not only your farm but visiting &amp; obtaining &quot;neighbors&quot; as well. The only aspect that I'm not crazy about is the need to obtain &quot;gems&quot;. Which can cost real money!
__label__1 ...my farm is my "get-a-way"...i spend hours "on the farm" and "visiting" the neighbors...i really enjoy planning and designing the layout of my farm, earning the money to buy the improvements on my wishlist and visiting neighbors and the community to ad
__label__1 love this game. easy enuff for my grand daughter to play.but it does have a problem connecting at times and we lose our crops
__label__1 plz add me I'm new to the game and will water and tip daily my storm id is Bettyboop2 if you need a neighbor I'm here
__label__0 This game is pretty good, but it has a fatal flaw. A ton of kids are getting harassed on this game and getting bullied. Its like the movie Cyberbully. I deleted this game after the harassment became to much.
__label__1 very fun I'm having no problems!I tried to download it before but it didn't so I tried again and now it works!
__label__1 I love this game a lot!But now it says there is an updated version you can download only on the app storeI only have a kindle fire thats regular! Plz helllpppp meeeIm afraud my flint corn will wither if i dont collect my crops!
__label__0 I HATED this game! It was so pointless because you have to buy almost everything with gems. It was truly  stupid. :(
__label__1 I have this game...Restaurant Story & Bakery Story. All are so much fun to play! Many boo-hoo these games because they think u have to spend real money on gems to play, this is not true. You get 2 gems for each crop/tree you master! There are 4 levels to
__label__1 Kindle Fire User. I love the game. You do NOT need to buy anything. If you are concerned about auto purchases you have the option of requiring password confirmations for in-game purchases.
__label__1 I LOOVVEE this game!!! i recommend this game for everyone!!! I also recommend all the teamlava games too they are so much fun and its pretty much all I play!! by the way if you want to be my neighbor my id is teralikespickles in all of them!!!
__label__1 There is plenty of stuff you can get without gems. I don't know about this game because you can't download it on kindle fire. But city story is awesome sure all it is it tapping but isn't that all any game for a tablet or smart phone is?
__label__1 Great knowing that your kids know how hard a farmer works! In this game you get to grow crops and go to other people's farm like your neighbors and the community. I would advise playing this on the Kindle Fire or Tablet, so it would be clear.Hope this re
__label__1 listen people...you CAN buy them for real $$$ IF YOU WANT to...it don't force you to buy any thing...it will try BUT you may decline if you want to...at least give this app a freaken chance BEFORE you rate it 1little star just because of that...plez peop
__label__1 I absolutely LOVE this game, but I tried to play today &amp; it's telling me that the version is no longer available, to download an update. So go to the app store &amp; there isn't an update &amp; in the game when you click on the update message, it tak
__label__1 for someone like me who has only a few quiet moments in a day this is perfect. if you're patient you can advance every few days.  annoying how pricey the gems cost - it'd be 5* if they made them a better value.  I haven't bought any just on principle
__label__1 If you don't want to spend cash, go to menu, settings, in -app purchasing, and disable. Easy as pie :)
__label__1 I miss staying in the farm. It reminds me of my childhood. I love it really.. five stars for this.
__label__1 have played game on kindle fire and hd kindle works great only downfall can't do achievements to win awards,but it is a very fun and every changing game.
__label__1 I have always liked this game, I play it on my iphone and find it very enjoyable. More games like this are needed for the Kindle.
__label__1 I do enjoy farm story. I determine how much time I have to dedicate to playing so it doesn't control me, I am in charge,although it can be addicting, so farm at your own risk...Happy Farming!!!
__label__1 I really like this game because it has many different options and settings.  This game is a way for city people to experience farming. Farm Story is good for all ages!
__label__1 YOU NEED TO GET THIS APP. PLZZZ ZZZ ZZZZ ZZZZZ ZZZZZ. ZZZZ ZZZ ADD IMGODSGIRL! ! ! ! ! FUN FUN FUN FUN FUN
__label__0 this sucks...I cant even purchase the app because it asks tor a credit card from amazon account...its suppled to he free I don't get it at all...
__label__1 I love this game great for all ages. It does let you buy things with real money withing the game so I would lock it in parental controls if you have a young child. Otherwise this game is great.
__label__1 I totally love this gave. It is fun growing plants and veggies. I can make new friends and get to see how they make their land. I really like it alot
__label__1 THE BEST GAME EVER FOR  EVERYBODY IN THE FAMILY , THE KIDS AND OLDER PEOPLE ARE LEARNING  A LOT AND PLAYING .

__label__1 such a wonderful game if you need paint or something else I will give it to you I send gifts daily my ssid is shotgunbabby again
__label__1 team lava is the best. I have all there games and I like restaunt story and that is awesome how can this be eny diffrent.
__label__1 you can do any. thing you want but it is not free but it ia really fun you should try. it every day
__label__0 i played farmville for a very long time so when i seen this i decided to give it a go and that lasted a few days at the most..this game is very bad things are to expensive and the lay out is not good either..and it froze up alot
__label__1 It is a great game. what people don't understand is that you don't have to buy the gems, you can earn them. slow process earning gems, but still, you can EARN them.
__label__0 Games by TeamLava take exploitation to a ridiculous level! The ability to build funds and awards to purchase items is slow tedious and works in real time. A friend of mine bought this game for her granddaughter. After she played the game for a few hours,
__label__1 this is similar to farmville from facebook. this is fun, you don't have to play it all the time because most plants take over an hour to grow... similar apps by team lava include bakery story and restaurant story... fun and somewhat addictive...
__label__1 I L - O - V - E  IT it is fun and easy too. it is great for kids
__label__1 Pls add warcraftgirl.  Super fun game.  I play most of the teamlava story games.  This one in particular is one of my favorites.
__label__1 fun game.  it is very additive and I can not wait to check my crops.  needs to have crops and flowers with shorter timers.
__label__1 This is a fun little story game that kept me entertained.  I&apos;d love to see more levels.\n\nI like the details.
__label__0 Been playing since feb every day now i cant says no longer supported?? Here we go again with teamlava and amazon!!Where is the updated version for kindle? Come on teamlava we know it is your fault i will never play another TL game again it's ridiculous w
__label__1 Enjoyable and relaxing.  Runs well on kindle fire.  Don't need to purchase anything unless you want to grow quickly (farm size and content).  I enjoy taking my time planting crops and tending animals.  Nice graphics also.  Good job TeamLava.
__label__1 This game is really easy but watch out for your money! You can get at another level in seconds! There are only 2 crops that are free and millions of other crops to choose from. You can invite friends too by E-mail or Skype!!!
__label__1 I love this game!!!! Fun way to pass time. If I could change one thing about this game it would be to have more chances to gain gems instead of purchasing them.
__label__1 I love it. I asked my parents what to choose either this game or city story. Then my mom said only 1 game. Then she said download 1 and play it then you can download another
__label__1 Reminds me a lot of the way Farmville was at one time.  Very enjoyable and you can play it as often or as little as you like.  The only downside is trying to find neighbors to help out.  I've wound up having to visit the Farm Story page on Facebook where
__label__1 okay this is so much fun! I recommend you get it cause it's fun on a kindle fire and when ur bored it is fun to play! get it.....it is free!!!
__label__1 I really really love to play this game (: I'm just really hoping goals would be added to it like restaurant story of bakery story. I'm more of follow the goals type person. Other then I play this game pretty much like crazy
__label__1 i got this game on my iphone, then on my kindle fire. beutiful illistations! i fell in love with this game!  :) i don't have enough space or time to have a farm,  so i got this game. i told my friend about this game,  shes playing it 24/7! this is an esc
__label__1 I think this game is cute and fun.. it keeps you occupied when you have nothing else to do..very entertaining.
__label__1 I love taking care of my farm  with  all  my animals and garden too  I think  other people will love thisgame very much.
__label__0 this game is so stupid I trier to collect my plants but it wont let me I know this app is free but don't waste your time playing it
__label__0 I play 6 teamlava games and on about level 80 of 99 on all. I used to love them. don't know whats going on but its changed. teamlava abandoned. city story but kept selling &quot;city bucks&quot; to new players for weeks. yesterday they increased prices 1
__label__1 but this game is awesome. And I should know, I'm a player. This game is fun, interesting to most, creative, ADDICTING, and strategic. When I say addicting, I mean ADDICTING. This game has kept me up most nights tending to my crops and animals, earning co
__label__0 It wouldn't work for me.  I didn't get what to do.  There were no goals or anything. It was very confusing.  Not worth it
__label__1 I have enjoyed this game so much.  If I get tired of playing the regular game, I try the advanced for a while and I am glad to get back to the regular game. Lots of fun.
__label__1 I love all of the apps by this developer. I have pet shop story... bakery story... resteraunt story... night club story... and now farm story. I totally recomemd any of the story apps... and if you like this one you should try fantasy islands!
__label__1 I have spent so many hours playing this game! One of the best apps you can get! There is so much to do and it is a lot of fun!!!!!!!!:)
__label__1 I love this game! as of now I'm a level 35 and have over 200 neighbors. my id is jrpreds1. People say u HAVE to buy gems to play. YOU DONT its a great game and the people who say you do are just mad that they are too stupid to buy them and not reading th
__label__1 farm story is a fun low stress game. it does not make your heart race and that is just what I wanted. Instead you plant your garden and wait for things to grow. The variety of plants animals and buildings complete with fences and paving stones is amazing
__label__1 I'm an avid online gamer. Im usually a console only gamer but this little farm game has pulled me away from my 360 for a very unexpected reason, the online community. You work together with people you meet in the game to expand your garden. By watering r
__label__1 I love it! you can plant any crop you want and get all the animals you want! I highly reccomend it to anyone!! :) try it out;)
__label__1 I like choosing what I can grow and moving thing where I want them.  I enjoy visiting my neighbor's farms and seeing what they do.  the only downer is that I haven't found any way to earn jewels to get the cool stuff.  don't want to spend a lot of cash j
__label__1 Looking for hours of fun? This is the game for you. The best part is being neighbors with other farmer's from all over the world.
__label__1 It has amazing quality and fabulous graphics. It is a easy "learn how game "and is perfect for all ages
__label__1 The very beet game ever.  Love to raze your animals without. going out of your house.  I love it. you are going to love it too!!!!!!
__label__0 This app is..... unknown to the the world. From the other reviews on all the other team lava games, most of the reviews are bad. All about gems. I'm probably not going to buy this games it'll just end up like the other games I'm assuming.  Doesn't sound 
__label__1 Very addicting!! I can't get enough. Can play for hours. Wish I more coins though for the stuff I want.
__label__1 I love these kind of games.this is probably one of my favorite one in all of Amazons app store.I rate it five stars!!!!!!  :)
__label__1 You got to get this fun filled game! If you download this and rate this game five stars then you're my best friend EVER!!!  YOU WILL LOVE THIS GAME FOR SHORE! This game is the bomb and a great time killer.  You NEED to download this game. LOVE LOVE LOVE 
__label__0 Although this game is fun, its almost the same game as Farmville. The biggest difference is that Team Lava keeps raising the prices of everything! I don't mean that you have to buy gems or spend one cent of your real money! Team Lava just keeps raising t
__label__1 This game is so cool! I love all farming games, but I wish there was a lot more farming games. Love the animals. My kids likes to play this to. I download this game for them and I started playing and I love it. I play it more then my kids do.
__label__1 YOU PEOPLE NEED TO READ THE DESCRIPTION BEFORE YOU BUY IT! THIS IS WHY YOU ARE GETTING CHARGED FOR GIVING IT TO YOUR KIDS!
__label__1 relaxing game. if you're looking for a long term game to relax and slowly level it is greatset crops and watch them grow
__label__0 If any of u like this, than omg. What a stupid game!!! Horrible. Wish i could give it a big fat 0!!!!
__label__1 You don't need to buy gems! and if you accidentally hit it buy gems it still requires password! And you can earn gems by planting certen crops! I've changed my name for 10gems opened 2 mystery boxs each for 24 gems and I've bought an elephant for 52 gems
__label__0 I love TeamLava. This game sucked. Horrible, everything is way too much money. I got it, then removed it immediately.
__label__1 It's as close to Farmville, without having to be on facebook (which I really love about it the most.)  If you have children, you may want to turn off in app purchases.  It's been a lifesaver for me, because my niece's &amp; nephew's can't purchase withou
__label__1 This game is so much fun you nead this game. It is Awesome. You want this game you will not regret it.
__label__1 I love the idea of running my own farm without the work. this is a great way to pass time.
__label__0 this app always closes when I'm invite it always says force close so I have to force the app to close
__label__1 I love this app so so much best app ever invented I hope they will never ever remove this app from the kindle fire store
__label__1 I love this game! It gives me a great chance to chat with my friends over the weekends. Plus it's free!!! But you can only chat with your friends if they play the game too.
__label__1 I love this game!!!! soooooo fun! best out of all story games!!! I extremely recommend it!! get farm story!!! my fave app!!!
__label__1 I love the fact that this game is enjoyable without having to overthink it ! I've never felt the pressure to spend any real money. It's a great stress reliever !
__label__1 I love this game and I live on a farm and this is like you own an farm in a game those I love ot
__label__1 Farm Story is a beautiful and well done app. This free game is a lot like Farmville. The gameplay is nice, and using the touchscreen can be very responsive. Then again, you kinda have to use the touchscreen. The game has good graphics and this game is no
__label__1 hey don't ask questions just install the game and don't let crops die. also get some neighbors and build a farm with animals

__label__1 Farm story is a fantastic game, and everyone I know who has it loves it! Team lava has done excellent on this game.

__label__1 I love this app! cant get enough of it. its almost like green farm. if u need a nieghbor add cooligen.
__label__1 If I could rate 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 stars I honestly would . This creator has out done himself once again . How does he come up with this . Fun addicting and free. Only three words for a top app and he has succeed.
__label__0 I hate it! I barely played it for 40 sec. before I uninstalled it. all you do is tap stuff. I down loaded it on my kindle fire and hoped it would be a fun time passer, But it was so boring. They try to make you buy &quot;gems &quot; with real money. Such
