__label__1 Really love it, can't stop. Kindle fire is s great device, web, reading, games, but sometimes I find this game gets more attention then my reading......LOVE IT
__label__1 This is a great game, but has a flaw. When you tap on the cell to win, you sometimes have to tap it a dozen or so times before it lets you tap on the item to win. More likely than not, you will lose that win.
__label__1 love this game. hope you upgrade it. thanks. I am glad that this game is so user-friendly and I like playing this version of bingo.
__label__1 Best bingo game I'm playing on my Kindle.  No issues, great game play.  Love that you can easily earn $, tickets and power ups as you are playing thus enabling you to play for a longer period of time especially compared to some bingo games out there.
__label__0 another disappointing game, I do not play this one I' am so sorry I got this game, I took it off m y list
__label__1 I enjoy this game a lot!  You connect a series of dots until all dots are connected.  The only negative thing I could say about this game is the voice that yells at you when you make a wrong move.
__label__1 this app is wicked. it is sooo fun and addicting. u should really get this app. it works really good on the kindle fire just to let other kindle fire owners if they are interested. but seriously......u should get this app.
__label__1 Legitimately my favourite app ever (aside from television apps ;P) and the ads aren't bothersome either, so it's a win-win!
__label__1 It makes my thirteen year old's &#34;brain work.&#34; She and i both enjoy it. Trace the lines throughout a drawing without crossing over a line multiple times. Becomes increasingly more complex. Graphics are aglow and kiddos like that as well.
__label__1 I luv this game so freaking much!!!!!its the most addicting game Ive evr played! I promise u jtht u will &lt;3 this game!
__label__1 the app was awesome! but got a little boring after 150 levels gone by!! still really great app and totally should by this!
__label__1 I LOVE this app! Very fun. Can easily be a time killer. I highly recommend this app if you like puzzles, and fun!
__label__1 this is so fun you use your brain I like it excpet for the ow when you make a mistake
__label__1 I love this game it couldn't be better I'm addicted. Very happy about this app. I played for hours straight. I got to level 178 in one day. SO ADDICTIVE!
__label__1 I loooooove this game its very fun and addicting its a must have game fun for all ages its awesomeley awesome
__label__1 I use this on my kindle fire and I have tried many,many, apes, but this one is the most addictive one and very challenging,  that I have played so far. Ionce u get going you can boy quit.!!  seriously!  you gotta try it out.
__label__1 GlowPuzzle is a Must Have for the puzzle lover. Very colorful and easy on the eyes. Difficult enough to challenge me, easy enough to keep me from getting frustrated. Apparently, an unlimited number of levels. My thanks and appreciation to the developer.
__label__1 I love this game so much! it is just so much tuna nd it is really addicting. I love puzzle games and games that relate to that so I downloaded this app because there were so many positive comments and me and my friends find it fun and addicting. so if yo
__label__1 Love how difficult and easy this app is. Fun to compete with the friends, family and the boyfriend. It's simple and fun.
__label__1 This app rocks. I &lt;3 this app. I love it and i think u will 2. I am bored out of my mind. HELP ME. :-|...
__label__1 Very fun little puzzle game with a twist. Some puzzles are easy, some are more challenging, but it's a fun game to kill some time and doesn't require any reading skills, so it's great for kids, too. For free, I'd highly recommend it.
__label__1 A lot more fun than I figured it would be. Addictive even. The idea is simple, following patterns by touching the screen, making designs in neon that remind me a lot of a light bright. You can fly through levels but there are lots here, plus different mo
__label__1 The is a a really great tool kit (utility) for the Droid. I especially like the utility that advises which apps can be moved to my SD Card and also the battery widget.
__label__1 this is great! It is like a one-stop-shop! Task killer, battery widget, CPU and an uninstaller all in one. It reminds u to put your new app to your SD card. nifty.
__label__0 Don't waste your space or time on this one. And the retail price is $4... forget it! Still waiting for thumb keyboard to come up on FAOTD.
__label__0 After I started using it my phone started rebooting randomly.  And when I uninstalled every thing went back to normal.
__label__0 don't bother with a space wasting battery eating program that is inferior to others and looks like an older ad-free version. your os already does it is better. where do these crazy promos come from?
__label__0 There is no reason for this app. All of this is or can be done much better. Dev just taking advantage.
__label__1 this app works great for me. thanks Amazon for offering it for free. i actually prefer this app to the last utility app that i had. user friendly interface and easy to figure out for the most part.
__label__1 Yes Android phones can do what this app offers. The app isn't magic, it just makes things a couple clicks easier to find. Instead of hunting through settings. It all right there one click. Pretty much for people that are not tech savvy and things easy.
__label__1 This app is worth a ton of money! It does all the things I need in a toolbox app. The developer is constantly improving the app, and is very responsive to input. I am really impressed with this, and I get the pro version for free today!
__label__1 This is actually an excellent and feature rich application. The difference between pro and free version are the ads and it seems most people don't get that.Anyway, it really is a swiss army knife of apps that keep you from having to install a ton of sepa
__label__1 After working with this for a month, and using a host of other things, I agree with another reviewer, this is better than Advanced Task Killer.  The main reason I like it is because it has everything I need to remember to watch all in one place.  Cache f
__label__0 Just wanted to put in my two cents. there is really nothing new about this app. Check the rights and restrictions.
__label__1 I tried both the Pro and the Free. The Free has  ads, the Pro does not. Version differences are by design. Test for yourself.
__label__1 this is an awesome app every android user should use this for their smart phone which is great. you should get this app today
__label__0 1. NEWER version in the market for free2. No dev website that I could find3. Review written by dev pretending to be a user.Shady shady dev.  I wish I hadn't downloaded.  Will Never install.  Wish I could rate this zero stars.
__label__1 A few weeks ago Amazon's free app was Taskkiller Pro.  I downloaded it, but killing tasks is not something that is so big in the latest versions of Android.  But the one thing I did love about it was that I could use it to find apps that could be moved t
__label__0 I have no respect for any dev that would go and give themselves 5star reviews. seriously they are so blatantly obvious!
__label__0 The Android OS already does these things, i dont see the purpose of installing an app that wastes more memory, ram, battery and cpu
__label__1 I liked the free version anyway, so this is a win.The &quot;older version than Android market&quot; problem is really Amazon's problem. They responded to my question with something about carefully testing apps. Certainly possible, but weak excuse. Makes 
__label__0 Downloaded, installed, and my tablet went FUBAR with 10+ apps force closing after reboot.  Uninstalled, fixed permissions, and it's back to normal.  Can't say what it was specifically but this app did not play well with my apps (even the Amazon AppStore)
__label__0 100% unnecessary. Android already does all of this (except, apparently batch, but who really needs to do that?) Just a waste of time, and just another scam trying to make a buck off of doing nothing. Do yourself a favor and stay away from this app.
__label__0 Like a previous reviewer pointed out, the same application seems to exist on the regular Android market but it's free to begin with and the version number is higher. Unless this &quot;pro&quot; version offers more functionality than the free version on t
__label__1 does everything it promises. really uniform ui, easy to use. overall good phone management app. already recommending app, looking forward to demoing the app on my review show
__label__0 Android OS already does this. Also, dev appears to be scamming people. Free version in google market that does the same thing.
__label__1 I've uninstalled 3 other utility programs since intslling this all in one tool.  Handles app2sd flawless)y.  Does tons more!  My favorite app!
__label__0 For peddling this old version that's free in the Android Market, and pretending that it's 3.99.Pathetic. Sad. Silly. Shady.
__label__0 These kind of apps are a waste of time and energy. The Android Os was designed to do these things by itself. It doesn't need your help!LEAVE ANDROID ALONE!!!!!
__label__1 A great program to do most of the&quot;necessary&quot;things that keep phone in working order, and all in one nice little place
__label__1 One person says something and the rest of you follow. There is no proof that the developer wrote the beginning reviews, let alone any of the reviews. And I'm sure he/she knew that Android was capable of doing everything this app does on it's own but peop
__label__0 I usually don't freak out about security, but these guys crossed the line.  One day after their aotd release, they sent out an update.  The aotd versions had suitable permissions for a system management app.  The update?  Not at all.If someone can explai
__label__0 Due to the weight of the reviews I am passing on the Free App of the Day for the first time since Amazon opened their app store.People's opinions do matter.
__label__0 why a) get something android already does for free B) is available for free on the market but w/o the pro tag. i think not.
__label__0 it seems the only 5 star reviews for this product is from the developer.  you do not need this app.  froyo already does all of this better than this app.  DO NOT DOWNLOAD
__label__1 this is an excellent app a bug existed and was foind and fixed within 24 hrs now that is service!
__label__0 I wouldn't recommend this app... even when they're giving it away.This app tries to do many things... and does none of them well.Try &quot;Elixir&quot; if your looking for a good free monitor app. &quot;AutoAppOrganizer&quot; and/or &quot;App 2 SD Free&q
__label__1 Wow! It's hard to see why people are so negative about this app. While I would never pay 4 bucks for it, as a free app it works just fine. Does Android already do all of this stuff? Yes, but this brings all of the functions into one place with a better i
__label__0 I used to use this app quite a lot. I actually used the free version from Google Play before it was available here. Too bad it seems the play version is way more updated than here, probably because they charge more for the &quot;pro&quot; version there. 
__label__1 Thanks for this app, many features make it a one stop tool for moving apps to the sd, installing/uninstalling apps, a task killer, battery checker, and more.Thanks again!
__label__1 I use this app to quickly move apps around from onboard storage to my microSD card and I use the included task killer widget to free up space and preserve battery life. This app also provides access to the hidden folders in your phone not normally availa
__label__1 Downloaded yesterday, so far does all I need it to. Replaced a few programs I had installed. Fast customer service for an issue I had with a pop up.
__label__0 Developing an app that is basically a virus and running it as the App of the Day is annoying. The multiple positive reviews that are clearly all from the same person is offensive. Sorry, developer. Make a substandard product, engage in obviously seedy pr
__label__0 This app would actually take up more memory and battery life! Android OS does all of the functions described here and a&quot;task killer&quot; actually would do more harm than good! Devs, stop making these things! And shame on Amazon for even offering th
__label__1 There are so many junk apps out there, this one gives a lot of great info without messing up my phone. I almost didn't get it, glad I did. Try it out and uninstall if you don't like it. HTC EVO 4G
__label__1 I absolutely love this app. It takes the place of so many. No need for a separate App2SD, it creates a list of all apps that can be moved, as well as notifies you, and you just move them from there. The uninstaller is great. You can batch uninstall which
__label__1 No I am not the developer, I'm just a fair user.Come on guys, this program does exactly what the developer claims. A few of the features are handy. It's not spectacular, but it worth keeping an eye on.You should thank Amazon and the author for giving us 
__label__1 I love this app! it has everything,  even an app killer and an uninstaller! Its the easiest way to access ALL your phone's settings!
__label__1 It works well.. You should therefore try it out.. Please make sure you stick to the plan and execute the best practices.
__label__1 The Good:From one app you can clear you app's cache, free memory, etc.The Bad:The folder system is annoying to use.
__label__0 I wish there was a way to give less then 1 stars. This has been a very good app for me. Worked as promised. I've been having battery issues and did a factory reset on my phone. Decided not to install Amazon app store and now SuperBox Pro does not functio
__label__0 This app is complete garbage and you can try all day long to post your own 5 star reviews, but everyone sees through that. Its a nice try, but if you are going to develop, #1 Create something that isn't included and #2 Let it stand on it's own, don't cre
__label__1 I've had this app for several months now. I use it daily. Sure, you can do most of what this offers already, but if I can put it all in 1 place in 1 app I'm all for that.My only complaint is Amazon allowing people who don't have the app to review it. If 
__label__1 It's just like age of war witch is awesome and amazing. It's a fun game. So I give it a thumbs up.
__label__1 I have two boys that are 4 and 3 and are very into dinosaurs and this interactive read to me book did the trick. They enjoyed it quite a bit. As other reviewers have stated, the facts may be a bit off as the T-rex was not the largest dinosaur but it is t
__label__1 Bought for my nephew he really enjoys the book. He thinks it's a big deal he cando it all by himself.
__label__0 t rex. was a little scavenger with tiny arms. if you want to see a real predator check out the spinosaurus, a 60 foot monster!!!!!
__label__0 my grandson was uninterested and he loves dinosaurs.  so short and a waste of money.  i would not recommend this to anyone.
__label__1 This app is designed for people who love audiobooks and convert their books from cd or get their books from places other than audible like the library or itunes. I have not tested audible files but it says it supports tons of formats and i have tested mo
__label__1 Works well for audiobooks, especially if you're switching between different books as I am.  It keeps your place and volume settings.  It only took me about half an hour to decide it was worth upgrading to the full version!
__label__1 I am a fan of librovox audio books, and this works great for listening to these recordings.  So simple and user friendly.  I appreciate the functions and simplicity.
__label__0 Would not play my audiobooks downloaded from another App. I had to find another App to listen to the audiobooks.This was a disappointment due to this Apps advertisement.
__label__1 Great game with multiple solutions for each puzzle. Their website says that they are now working on an expansion pack with new elements.
__label__1 I am completely hooked on this game. I downloaded it and went to go eat breakfast,  half an hour later I was still playing this game and hadn&apos;t eaten. The only thing that bothers me though is I don&apos;t think there should be an option to use pigme
__label__1 There are many ways to solve any given level, which I really appreciate. And the ability to see how others solved it puts this game firmly in 5-star territory.
__label__1 Brilliantly done. I&apos;m glad to finally see a challenging game offered as the free app for a change. (If you missed it for free, it&apos;s well worth your dollar.) The only problem I&apos;ve had so far has been that prisms sometimes get messed up when
__label__1 This game keeps me challenged, sometimes for days. Totally worth a dollar. No fc issues on my droid charge. Don't let a couple complaints about controls deter you, it takes some getting used to although if you long press a mirror or prism it will delete 
__label__1 I purchased this app from the Android app store and I can guarantee you that it is well worth the 99 cents, let alone getting it for free. Some people won't get the concept of the game because they are well, idiots! But if you are of a higher order, grab
__label__1 Very highly addictive. May be banded as a substance control drug. And may be a felony for even have this game on your person. Has been known for tearing families apart, in the future it may rise to $0. 99 a megabyte so get it now at this low price.... Oh
__label__1 This is a great game.  Works great on my tablet.  It's a game you can sit down and actually look for a solution rather than throwing a bird again and hoping it hits in the right spot. This is definitely a game you need to show your Apple friends since th
__label__1 I'm pretty terrible at puzzle games, and these are definitely challenging.  That said, it's a simple enough mechanic that you can wrap your head around what you're trying to do, even if the solution isn't obvious.  I am partially color-blind, so occasion
__label__1 This game is deceptively simple and often maddeningly deceitful. A puzzle fan&apos;s delight but it&apos;ll test your iq. an effortless recommendation @ $1 droid x cm7
__label__1 The game is very well designed, and the levels are very clever. The new update seems to have added the ability to look at other people's solutions. Unfortunately, the solutions don't always save right, so there is some fiddling you have to do to get the 
__label__1 i picked it for free and couldnt stop  playing it. i now only have one lvl left if youve figured ou lvl 6.6 please tell me  because im at a loss
__label__1 this is currently my favorite goto game when I'm stuck somewhere waiting. challenging without being frustrating. is nice to look at too. after the first few levels I thought I would get board, but once you get past section two it gets more interesting.
__label__0 I really enjoy puzzle games and I thought the concept was interesting but this game just simply runs awful, even on high end phones. Additionally, it&apos;s just not at all fun to play. Very boring gameplay, controls, and interface. There were several co
__label__1 The game is difficult at times. Hands down the best puzzle game out. I love the challenge it brings. Runs great on the HTC Incredible
__label__1 recommend this to anyone who likes a challenge. a really unique puzzle game that requires a bit of patients to figure out.
__label__1 This is a very clever and challenging puzzle game. I can not stop playing it. Perfect as a quick, on the go time waster.
__label__1 This is a beautifully logical puzzle game, with nice super-visible (and perfectly simple) graphics. Learn to mix colors and manipulate angles using mirrors and prisms. The game starts off easy to allow you to learn its controls, but then gradually become
__label__0 rebooting issue started with the installation of this app and ceased right after I uninstalled it. besides that it was an OK game. my reviews are usually only positive ones, but the rebooting issue killed me. [sensation 4g]
__label__1 Great job developers.  I&apos;m a big fan of puzzle games and this one is a lot of fun.  I don&apos;t know what the one reviewer considers &quot;a high end phone&quot; but this thing runs without a hiccup on my rooted droidx and galaxy tab.  Thanks again
__label__1 I really liked the concept of using mirrors and prisms to reflect, split or combine colored lasers and match the color of the goal. The interface is nice and simple and game is easy to play. The difficulty is finding the right combination of prisms and m
__label__1 This is by far the best phone game I have ever played.  I am impressed with its intellectual concept and challenging levels.  I have spent many a sleepless night speeding through the clock playing.  Thank you!
__label__1 Super fun and addicting game. Wish it was available on iOS since I don't have my Kindle anymore. If you like puzzle games this is a good one. The levels start out pretty easy, then some get pretty tricky.
__label__1 Fantastic game! Challenging and different game play. I am really enjoying it. Not too hard but not too easy is making for a fun experience.
__label__1 Not a game that can be played with extraneous noise going on, needs a high level of concentration. I can see this appealing to nascent scientists.
__label__1 I really like this game. It&apos;s more fun than a bindle of carrots! I guess it could be classified as a physics of light game, but that&apos;s a little too wordy. it&apos;s fun, not that difficult, and definitely worth a dollar.
__label__1 If you do its your own fault for being stupid. Wait till its free, this happens almost every day, you think people would get it by now.
__label__1 This game runs well on android. It is very challenging but not so challenging that you get frustrated and stop playing. Every level presents unique challenges to overcome. I really love this game and will be disappointed when I finish it. Great concept g
__label__1 I always wanted to get myself that Khet laser game, but didn't want to spend $30. Refraction is a fun and entertaining take on using mirrors and prisms to redirect light beams to hit targets. This is the first game that I have paid for. I don't have a lo
__label__1 This game is a fantastic and addictive time killer, but it is very hard to select colors in the prism, which I find very annoying. Sometimes, the prism will disappear. All in all, a very good game in which I am enjoying very much!
__label__1 This game is a lot of fun and it is absolutely worth a buck. It is a unique puzzle game that will keep you entertained. Highly recommended.
__label__1 I don't play a lot of computer games. I almost never play games on cell phones. But when I saw this as the Free App of the Day, I snapped it right up. I had played a more sophisticated PC version of this game a few years back, and was hooked.This is a lo
__label__1 The graphics are very basic but the game is easy to learn once you start playing around with it. I like that it is a very smart game and that there are multiple solutions. If you are up for a brain challenge then I would say that this game is definitely 
__label__1 This is a great game! I&apos;ve played similar flash games before, but this version improves on them. I&apos;m glad it is the free app of the day, but after playing it, I would gladly pay for it...
__label__1 Could&apos;ve sworn I played this game before; but must have been thinking of something similar. None the less, this is a great game. Ramps up nicely and doesn&apos;t simply throw you to the wolves; nor does it treat you with kid gloves. Also a good way 
__label__1 a excellent time waster,  great puzzles and its absolutely perfect for the train ride into the city.  an A+ application on the original droid.
__label__1 The game is pretty fun and so far from what I can tell it is kinda like the puzzles used to open crates in Gameloft&apos;s Nova. Now I have a rooted htc EVO with cm7.0.3.1(if you don&apos;t know what that is well maybe google it and find out it&apos;s wa
__label__1 This is a nice mellow puzzle game for when you don&apos;t have a lot of time.  Puzzles are well thought out and challenging not frustrating.
__label__1 wasn&apos;t sure the first few levels but now it&apos;s gotten personal. I have been. cracked out on this for hours
__label__1 Takes a couple levels to get the hang of the controls but easy afterwards. For those that said it&apos;s too hard too quickly, well the world needs ditch diggers too. Seriously, it might just not be your type of game. Don&apos;t ask them to dumb it down 
__label__1 Refraction is a great, addictive logic puzzle game.  It starts off pretty easy, but quickly moves on to much more complicaed levels.  Very fun game--definitely worth the $0.99 price.
__label__1 Got this as free app of the day but I&apos;d happily pay for this ($0.99 is a steal)!  Game looks easier than it is, but that&apos;s not a bad thing!  It&apos;s just challenging enough! Definitely try it out!
__label__1 This &quot;game&quot; has given me many hours of fun!  I say game, but it&apos;s much more than that, it&apos;s also a good mental workout.  I&apos;m a programmer and games like these keep my brain sharp.  For me the first 3 levels were a really easy, bu
__label__1 This IS my Go-To game of preference - I prefer it to anything similar or dis-similar out there!  I love it and wish they would add more levels!
__label__1 I got the free version from the other app market, which might be why my scores appear to not have transferred to this paid version. Pretty much my only real complaint about this app, and not a big one since I&apos;ll just replay those levels again.\n\nSi
__label__1 I started playing this game and then told my husband about it so he could join in on the madness. Now I have to try to drag him away. It's addictive and employs sometimes thinking about things in ways you weren't expecting.
__label__1 This is one of the best executions of this style game I have ever seen. The puzzles are unique and require thought but are not so difficult they can&apos;t be solved (yet). Love this app!
__label__1 I picked this app up when it was the free app of the day, but it is definitely worth more then the $.99 this dev is charging. It&apos;s fun, challenging, and well made.
__label__1 It's a fun puzzle game that's challenging without being too frustrating. The components are simple - colored beams of light, mirrors, and prisms which split the light beams in two. You have to guide the beams of light to the same-colored targets. It star
__label__1 This is a fun and clever game but it takes a while to get interesting.  After about 30 levels I was ready to call it quits because the levels didn't feel challenging, just tedious.  But shortly after this the difficulty ramps up-- the boards are more con
__label__1 The concept is simple, the channenge is simple enough to split light beams and then recombine them.  I have enjoyed this app so much as a way to pass time and for 99 cents I highly recommend it to everyone.
__label__1 The app does not become free until 3:15 AM EST.  That&apos;s 12:15 AM PST for those of us who can&apos;t understand what a time zone is. \n\nThe app itself. It&apos;s hilariously fun. Definitely worth getting. Goofy and fun to play.
__label__1 Like portal, this game offers exactly what you expect, a bunch of fun puzzles that make you think, but are solvable. You get more than enough pieces to accomplish a puzzle so there are countless ways to beat each level. Yet the limited amount of space fo
__label__1 A great little puzzle game that plays on colors and their interactions.  This might have a chance of being difficult if you&apos;re colorblind, but even then still worth a try.
__label__1 This game is really interesting and entertaining. It requires you to think and it&apos;s frustrating yet rewarding. Controls are pretty obvious and practical.
__label__1 This is an awesome game that gets progressively harder as you advance.  I got this as a Free App of the Day, but would have definitely bought it if necessary.  Thanks!
__label__1 simple concept but the puzzles are very fun. some of them are quite easy others took me a long time to figure out. great game to pull out when I only have a few minutes. I hope to see a sequel.
__label__1 this is the most fun of any the brain teasers I have tried on google android.  if you like brain teasers and don&apos;t like this it&apos;s not the program it&apos;s you.  It it is very challenging . You can use it in shorts stents, but I found it very h
__label__1 Great Time stealer ! Will not Disappoint  Still have not gotten passed the first level.  Has me thinking in my sleep how to solve!
__label__1 Love this game for its puzzle solving and critical thinking. Keeps me entertained, and is a great learning game for my son. Works perfectly on my Epic 4G.
__label__1 This is a fun puzzle game in which you use mirrors and prisms to align and change colors to solve the puzzles. The difficulty of the levels range from easy to pretty difficult. This game is fun and works perfect on the kindle fire. Great value at .99 cen
__label__1 I've actually had this game for quite a while when the dev posted it in r/Android on Reddit a while back. I liked how during testing he got the input of the Android community there and made a lot of tweaks according to what users posted. Not a lot of Red
__label__1 I paid for this game a few weeks ago. Once I got the hang of it, you couldn&apos;t drag me away. Maybe now that it&apos;s free app of the day, people might start sharing screenshots online. Because some levels are tough.
__label__1 Very original puzzle game, but I wish there was an option to turn off haptic feedback.  I also wish there wasn&apos;t a 20 word minimum...
__label__1 The app works great.  No problems so far.  As for the game, I like it.  Good puzzle game.  I will recommend this to all my friends
__label__1 I got this as a FAotD and have made it roughly through the first &apos;sector&apos;.\nIts very configurable.  So far, puzzles have been interesting, without being too complex.  Your solutions seem to be stored so you can try to improve the economy of the
__label__1 I thoroughly enjoy this game. Haven&apos;t put it down since I downloaded it. Oonce you get the hang of it, the only frustration is solving the puzzle itself. Took some ui setting changes to get the prisms usable...
__label__1 one of the better free apps of the day. i actually played the demo app a couple of days ago, and now its free. glad amazon is starting to make better apps avaliable for the free one of the day. even if it was not free today i would have bought, get it wh
__label__1 It's worth every single cent. Definitely a great time waster on your phone. Don't mistake this for anything other than a puzzle game, but I absolutely adore that each puzzle has multiple possible solutions, allowing you to piddle around, and work it out 
__label__1 people need to learn two things before they download the daily free app...\n1. how to read\n2. patience\nso much fail in here
__label__1 This is what a game should be...easy to learn but always a challenge as each new level gets progressively harder.  Fantastic!!!!
__label__1 This is a very enjoyable bunch of logic puzzles.  They start easy enough but before long they really make your brain work to figure them out.
__label__1 great, fun and challenging game!! People, don&apos;t leave low reviews because you don&apos;t know how to read directions. I have a MyTouch4G (with a 3.5&quot; screen) and I can read them just fine. Keep it up devs!!!
__label__1 I got this the other day when it was free but i would have gladly paid for it. Great game all around, and very unique. Like someone else said, its a nice break from angry birds. This is my new favorite. Looks and runs great on my droid 1, cant wait to pl
__label__1 This wallpaper is so pretty! My fav color is green too, so it makes it better! Works perfect and the quality is beautiful on LG Optimus V.
__label__1 It's 3D! As you move to different screens on your android device you get to see different angles of the fountain.
__label__1 This Wallpaper is really beautiful. It does do some damage to your battery life, but not as much as others I have used. The scene turns as you move through your home screens. As a proud Celtic, I have to say I love it!
__label__1 I really liked the way this looks on my DROID2. smooth graphics with no lagging. I was willing to by the upgrade just to support them
__label__1 I got this app and instantly loved it ,I'm irish so that's why!!! its great because it has beautiful green clovers ,it shines light onto the pretty fountain, it has beautiful background!!!!!!!!! (There is no sound )it is great for Irish lovers!!! i totta
__label__1 Is very pretty. No problems using the wallpaper. I Recommend this wallpaper. er er er er er er er e
__label__0 Does not work for Droid Incredible v.1. Glad I did not spend money in this. Will try to reinstall when I upgrade my phone in March.
__label__0 I'm searching and searching and searching for an app that will join the ringer, system and notifications volumes, but none seem to work for the S3.  this is about the 10th one I've tried today.
__label__0 OK, but cumbersome and time consuming to work with. I like only one or two clicks to make things work the way I want on my equipment.
__label__1 I don't know everything this program does because I'm lazy that way. What it does for me is let me reset the volume on my phone with one touch. I have a Samsung Galaxy Nexus and it is far too easy to change the volume on different things without even not
__label__1 Fixed my problem on my Kindle Fire. On the top of the right corner of it, it had an Icon with a mute on it. It fixed.it and now I have an alarm. Really good app.
__label__1 My devise needed that extra boost, and this APP was just right!  It help give it a louder and more clear tone....
__label__1 This is the best app for controlling the sound for every thing on the kindle every one that has one should get this app you will love it as much as I do
__label__1 I was having trouble with my kindle and it wouldn't have a sound when a app was done downloading and it had a mute sign at the top right but the sound was turned all the way up .when I downloaded this app I found almost every thing about the volume has i
__label__0 I've deleted this app after 6 months because it wasn't helpful for me.I had hoped it would allow me to boost the volume on my Kindle Fire at those times that I need it.I heard no difference from before or after.
__label__1 This is definitely the answer if you're having volume issues with your android/tablet. The volume gets loud enough for headphones and even loud enough to hear across the room in my case. Not bad. A quick warning however is that music can get really loud 
__label__1 I only wish that I had internet on my phone to download it because the App on my Kindle Fire is so much easier to use then the tool on my phone.  You just cannot beat the price - free.
__label__1 Simple and easy to use. Perfect for my Kindle Fire, I use Google voice for texting on it and the notification sounds were never loud enough.
__label__0 wasteful app for a kindle.  Don't bother, don't waste your time downloading & installing.  Completely unnecessary.  If you are having trouble with your volume, this won't fix it, there are other solutions.
__label__1 This is a very nice free app but it doesn't do anything you couldn't do yourself.  It does, however, make changing the volume much easier since all the controls are in one spot so I give it five stars.
__label__1 Absolutely love qvc and this app puts one of my favorite shopping apps right at my fingertips everywhere I go very simple to use
__label__1 App downloaded quickly and was easy to use.  I was able to browse and shop as usual with no problems.
__label__1 As with everything QVC this app is wonderful.  Makes comparison shopping easy and purchases fast and easy.  This app is greatly appreciated.
__label__1 Being able to shop on my favorite home shopping network is great!It was easy to install and setup on my Kindle Fire HD. Now I shop anywhere I am.I highly recommend this app!!
__label__1 Glad to have this app. I'm new to Kurio 7s tablet & this helps me to view it without going thru my website. I can never get it to do right! With this, I can see things better.
__label__1 Good app I use QVC quite a bit, it's easy to navigate. I love having it on the carousel and not needing to go thru the web.
__label__1 Good Kindle App.  The QVC site has some glitches, and makes to too easy to order using 1 click so watch out.
__label__1 Great short cut to get to QVC, love all the apps, easy to use and fast.  Thanks again for the great app
__label__1 I am glad to see this on my Kindle Fire. I don.t always need my computer to check out items being offered on QVC.
__label__1 I am happy to have the QVC app for my Kindle.  I plan to use it mainly to browse..any buying I do will be done by phone
__label__1 I check with QVC every morning and night before bed. This APP is so much easier than signing onto my computer.I keep updated on my order status, past  items on air (my favorite part) and TSV.
__label__1 I find the shopping on QVC to be quick and easy, and the products to be what they're touted to be. So anything that makes the site easier to use is ok by me.
__label__1 if you are a shopper here you will like this one.  It connects you to the same QVC you know and trust.  Has worked well for me when I used it.
__label__1 If you like shopping with QVC....you will be very glad to use this app.  After all....many people bought their Kindle Fire's HD from QVC, and Amazon would not let any company handle their sales if they did not think they were completely capable and effic
__label__1 I got this app for my grandmother who is in to the QVC stuff and she seems to approve of its ease of use and convenience.
__label__1 I have been a customer of qvc for over 20year's of course I love the channel do most of my shopping with them
__label__1 I have this app on my phone and added it to my Kindle.  It is an easy way to see what has recently aired or what is on clearance or easy pay.  It is also an easy, maybe too easy to purchase.  It is a simple 1 click and the item is purchase and on it's wa
__label__1 I love it.
__label__1 I. LOVE QVC BEEN WITH THEM FOR.OVRR 20. YEARS Great clothes and. All other things from jewelry to. Bedding toHeaters. You. Get it the Q has everything at great prices
__label__1 I LOVE SHOPPING ON QVC THEY PROVIDE GREAT DEALS. IT'S EASY TO ORDER . LOVE THE VIDEOS ON HOW MANY OF THEIR PRODUCTS ARE MADE TO SIMPLY WORK AND ARE RATED.
__label__1 I love shopping this way. They have everything you need and then some. They have great recipes, if that is what you like, but they have everything for the home, and personal things, clothing, etc.for the ladies. They also have gardening, flowers, and eve
__label__0 I opted out of this app as I no longer will shop with QVC.  I have shopped with them since they were CVN and have spent literally thousands of dollars with them.  I got stiffed on my last purchase.  I ordered a set of chair arm covers and a headrest cove
__label__1 I order regularly on this appl.  It is easy and accessible and glad it is on my Kindle Fire. YES!
__label__1 I WATCH ON TV, BUT SO MUST BETTER TO HAVE IT ON THE TABLET ON MY LAP FOR QUICK ACCESS

__label__1 Love,Love.  I can view what is going on the Q without disturbing my granddaughters programs .Also when traveling there is easy access
__label__1 Makes shopping easy and fun ! The TSV's are usually real bargains. The easy pay option is always a help. I like that you receive the item after the first payment.Be careful,QVC can be addictive..LOL
__label__1 My favorite shopping place!  LOVE it!  This makes my shopping experience so easy and I can buy stuff with a few clicks!
__label__1 Of course this is great, I have been a QVC shopper forever and I can Q anywhere there is Wi-Fi to look at all the latest sales and styles without buying a thing.  This way I never miss a Today's Special.  Thus I can show others the great things on the Q.
__label__1 QVC is my favorite home shopping channel, so of course I was thrilled I was able to download this app. Loads quickly and very easy to use.
__label__1 Recently cut out cable and miss qvc. Now I can watch live from my kindle. Great app. Highly recommended. No glitches so far
__label__1 This QVC app is just like being on TV.  You click on it, and there you are, ready to shop till you drop.  If you like watching QVC, this free app for the Android is perfect.  I have it for my Kindle and it works great.  Yes, I do recommend this.
__label__1 What is it that  qvc don&#34;t sell. i just sit & watchthem do there thing. every hour by the hour it&#34;s sonething different. this us a must have app.
__label__1 Works great for me. I can go directly to QVC without having to go through the web process.  Highly recommend.
__label__1 You can see what the TS is without having to turn on your computer.  It makes it so easy to shop
__label__0 I would like to know who ordered this product for me.  I don't use it and am afraid that it might have a virus.
__label__1 I am a great fan of QVC and ordering from this company. Their range of products is HUGE, their customer service dept. is the best, their shipping dept. gets orders to me FAST and in perfect condition, and their returns dept. so helpful and understanding.
__label__1 I like the convenience of home shopping. Doing it on my Kindle will be even better. I would recommend QVC to my friends
__label__1 Love the app to get to QVC, they are number one with me. You can review items they have available, but you have to have WiFi to be able to get this app. Can't say enough about being able to get to QVC on this app without having a computer available all t
__label__1 I have shopped QVC for years and years.  Now the site is available all the time and at my finger tips.  It is so easy if you have any questions or concerns.  Everything I have purchased has been great.
__label__0 I can not post to the community forum using the app. The browsing experience is nothing like the website experience.  I just uninstalled the app and prefer to use the silk browser on my kindle fire.
__label__1 The QC app is great for the Android.  I have shopped w/ QVC for 15 years.  Their service is impeccable.  The values--especially for jewelry are unmatched.  30-day returns are a wonderful option.
__label__1 I LOVE QVC. SIMPLE AS THAT. PRODUCTS ARE TOP RATED. RETURNS IF NEEDED&#62; BUT never needed to return anything ever. I love the operators when I call in. Ordering on line is easier than ever before.I could hooked on buying and buying, but I watch my spen
__label__1 Another great online shopping app from another renowed shopping channel. It also expands the choices for online shopping. QVC is nice although I find HSN better.
__label__1 I have been a fan of QVC since 1987.  Love having it on the go.  I have to always check out the Today's Special.
__label__1 Great app. I use this all of the time.  It does take some getting used to as it has a different layout from my home computer. Still it works really well.
__label__1 I think this application is great.  Whenever you aren't near your cell or just want to know what is being shown, etc., this app is there for you.  It is convenient and easy to navigate.
__label__1 I have been a fan of QVC for quite some time and i love that i can now get it on my Kindle. My first order off it was so easy and i just love having the ability to order and view other than my phone or computer.
__label__0 This app takes several seconds to load and sometimes will take minutes.  It often returns an error message that it needs to close either when I'm using the app or when I'm doing a product search.  I tried uninstalling it and also removing it from my list
__label__1 Being a big QVC fan, I do like this app !  I need to explore it more...with my credit card in hand.
__label__1 This app has made my life so much easier, when needing to search for products on the 7" tab. I used to have to type qvc.com in a web browser...but with this app, I type what we need and in a few seconds (usually) the product is there. Love It!!!!!
__label__1 I do not shop at stores and don't buy more than what I need.  No compulsion buying and I check reviews before buying
__label__1 HD quality video streaming is nice, plays fluidly and doesn't disconnect. Ability to check your order status, view the item on air, and recent items on air are nice touches. App looks nice, has good graphics, and transitions well when moving from one thi
__label__1 This app is great for accessing you qvc account.  It is very easy to use. You can save your info for fast shopping.
__label__1 I shop on QVC all the time.  its great,  no hassle driving  to the store to try on clothes.  you order & receive new merchandise to try for 30 days.  if you do not like it, just return for refund minus shipping.  if you need a different size, just return
__label__1 I check it from time to time to see what is featured. Love to see what is on even when I'm away from the tv
__label__1 I enjoy seeing the products that I am most interested in at my convince. And only those I want. I do most of my shopping with qvc.

__label__1 QVC has such wonderful products. Now I can access anywhere there is WiFi. I buy quite a bit from QVC. It has gotten much easier now. The free access is great. Wish we could access the &#34;In The Kitchen With David APP&#34;, however. It seems to only be 
__label__1 one of my favorite channelshave on another deviceso much easier to usenot always in the room with the pc
__label__1 This app makes finding an item on  QVC so much easier. Any one ever frustrated by the experience of  trying to get through their product finder line, will be glad to have it. I do find myself comparing prices between QVC and Amazon now too. LOL
__label__1 I have been a member and a shopper from qvc from  day one, before it was called qvc. I just love it. But shipping and handling is a little high. The hosts are wonderful.
__label__1 As a senior citizen with some disabilities, being able to shop on line or from the TV with great value, selection, and pricing not to mention having it delivered to my door is a combination that cannot be beat.  Customer service is excellent, return poli
__label__1 My wife loves it, Dave can see what specials are on and what was on that day.  While she loves it, kind of hard on my wallet.
__label__1 On line shopping is easy and computer friendly. Customer service is the best I've ever had the pleasure to do business with. Always polite and eager to get the customer what they need. Products are usually top quality.
__label__1 I don't buy a lot from qvc but when I want to check on items I can quickly do this now on my kindle....5 stars
__label__1 I use QVC often for certain brand name items and I really enjoy having this app at my fingertips so if I need anything--it is right there. I recommend it for anyone who loves NPR programs.
__label__1 I have been a customer for over 20 years.  And while there have been some &#34;duds&#34; the majority of my purchases have been GREAT.  (Just ask my charge account.)  No matter what you need they will have a selection for you.  I am more than satisfied.
__label__1 I LOVE QVC!!!This app makes it so easy to shop QVC! So easy to order if you need to get in before the item is sold out!
__label__1 It allows me to see what the today's special value is when I am not at home. I have it on my phone and my Kindle which I take with me everywhere.
__label__1 If you like shopping QVC then this app is what you need.Easy to use, fast...takes you where you wanna go & you use less data searching!
__label__1 If u love qvc like I do then get the app.Very ez to use just like going on your laptop:)
__label__1 you can' t go wrong with them. everything is easy to return no matter what it is and it's good quality items.
__label__0 It seems this edition does not allow or accept passwords so in my oplnion &#34;what's the point?&#34;. It could be the app is not Kindle compatible.
__label__1 Like having this on all my gadgets to keep up this the specials and what is coming up next plus the alerts for the shows I like even when not at home.
__label__1 THIS IS A GREAT APP TO HAVE ON YOUR TABLET. YOU GET RATINGS OF PRODUCTS AND SO MUCH MORE THAN SHOPPING ON THIS APP.
__label__1 really like this app I shop on my tablet a lot. but I also tried to find an hsn app but could not find one hope you get one of those soon
__label__1 I have been dealing with QVC for over 25 years.  They are a quality company the &#34;Q&#34; in QVC, that stands behind the products they sell.  Their service is fast, reliable, and always pleasant.
__label__1 I lie in bed at night looking at my QVC app in the dark till I fall asleep!  lol... Like a lullaby, I guess.... thinking of what to buy the next day.  Shop for clothing, jewelry, whatever... they have it all.
__label__1 I downloaded this for my Kindle only.  It's easy to navigate and I enjoy shopping in my jammies.  Good product.
__label__1 can check specials and order easily with the app...No problems using it....easy to find those bargains ..don't miss anything..it's great
__label__1 If you like on line shopping this is an app for you. Easy payment process and good selection all the time.
__label__1 Great app, free app, love my QVC shopping, easy to use, never have any problems.  Can't go wrong with this one.
__label__1 I love the way QVC is saving me money.  I especially love the Cooking with David; never miss him on Sundays.
__label__1 Of all the shopping channels this is the best of the bunch!!  The download app is free and you can do some great shopping on your phone or kindle without getting out of your chair.
__label__1 This app is great if you purchase from QVC.  It is better than doing it from the phone by far
__label__1 How could anyone not love having this on their tablet? Keeping up with what has been aired is fun. Not having a TV around is not a problem.
__label__1 Yep- it's QVC  but not in all it's glory.  Probably a better experience on something better than a 7&#34;  Product thumbnails are small  Going to a deeper screen doesn't help.  Order Status is limited.  Font is tiny, You'll need your glasses
__label__1 Uploaded the QVC app to my Fire quickly and easily. The layout is done very well and I love being able to look at everything QVC has to offer right at my finger tips! If you are a QVC fan I highly recommend getting this app.
__label__1 Good sales and prices and a place to get new items before they hit retail stores at a higher price.
__label__1 Shop QVC all the time and now I can check this app without having to go to the computer or the TV.  Great purchase.
__label__1 I love QVC.  I watch it all the time on TV.  And now I can watch it on my Kindle Fire.  In fact, I bought the Kindle Fire from QVC.
__label__1 So convenient to have this on my Kindle - easy to check the TSV and any other product at the tip of your fingers
__label__0 If I could give 0 stars, I would. App took forever to download. It was always hard to open, if it did at all. And I could never get it to let me look up or order anything. I finally deleted app and use web. Sorry QVC, just telling it like it is.
__label__1 I love the QVC App as I order a lot from QVC.  Glad I was able to get in on my kindle.
__label__1 QVC IS AN AWESOME PLACE TO SHOP!  IT'S SO HELPFUL TO SEE ITEMS PRESENTED AND INSTRUCTED ON USE.  LIVING IN A SMALL TOWN HAS IT'S DRAWBACKS, SUCH AS HAVING TO DRIVE AN HOUR FOR SHOPPING!  EASY PAY ADVANTAGE IS A GREAT OPTION TO STRETCH YOUR PAYMENTS OUT, 
__label__1 I enjoy shopping on QVC and prefer to order online, so I was pleased to find the app available for Kindle Fire.  Terrific viewing experience on the tablet, and I prefer it to using the app on my phone.  I have had no issues with the app on the Fire.
__label__1 if you are a qvc shopper this app is a must have .  allows you to place an order quickly or just browse and shop for things.
__label__1 I enjoy watching QVC and now to be able to get behind the scenes as I'm watching...THIS IS AWESOME !!!!
__label__1 This site is easy to navigate and clear to use. Some sites are not so easy yo understand. The shopping choice are great.
__label__1 I did my entire Christmas shopping thru QVC because I'm handicap and everything went smoothly...no problems at all.  Love it.
__label__1 Anyone who knows me, knows that I enjoy my QVC purchases.  I can search for items I want or even watch a live show, it's great.
__label__1 Who doesn't love QVC!!!  I love that I can view my QVC specials while visiting relatives (and they don't even know that I'm shopping while talking to them)!
__label__1 Great app if you love QVC. It makes it easy to shop and inquire about different products. I have said all I need to.
__label__1 Good for looking up QVC items, but haven't figured out how to make a purchase using it, however. .Price is right.  FREE!
__label__1 I am using this on the HTC Evo 3D.  It is amazing.  Stability controls. A ton of various effects to check out. Easy to use and slick User Interface (much, much better in 3.0).  You can take a picture with both the front/back facing camera.  Voice activat
__label__1 This app is great! The camera on my Galaxy Attain did not have a zoom and I downloaded this app and it made it zoom. There are a lot of separate "packs" that you can can download to change your pics and enhance them. Overall, I can say that it is worth i
__label__0 THIS IS A SCAM! IT WOULD NOT LET ME INSTALL AND SAID I HAD NOT PURCHASED IT BUT NOW THERE IS A CHARGE ON MY CARD THAT SHOWED UP AFTER THE REFUND PERIOD!!!
__label__1 An all around superior camera.  I first started using it as a work around to the buggy stock camera on my Droid 3.  Very quick, responsive shutter.  Tons of *free* editing and filter add-ons!  This is the camera app that pros use when their SLR isn't han
__label__1 This app is very nice.  I use it instead of the camera app that came with the phone.  So many options. Its like a new toy.  I dont know what to play with first.  Well worth the price for the paid version.
__label__0 Was starting to work, than it froze my phone right up and had to remove the battery.  To bad because it looked like it was a good app.  Trying to get my money back.
__label__1 This has been my stock camera app for quite some time. I regularly get better pics from this app vs my stock camera on my Droid X. Whoever said you can't shut off the shutter sound is very wrong, by the way.This app has a crazy amount of free downloadabl
__label__0 Evo4g - FC constantly. Disabled stock cam. Dev responded quickly but could not resolve. Nice features but useless if unusable. Beware, this bonked my entire phone.
__label__1 Better than stock camera app. More options and my pictures look a lot better now. I have a Galaxy 3S and it really helps.
__label__1 i have bought several photo apps, but this one is so easy to use, and more options, i will use it a lot
__label__1 Oh my gosh, I was scared.The reviews said that it was bad.The reviews said it was not good.But try it.With full security.Oh, by the way, put helpful, please. I'll check it in 2 weeks.I wanna get to at least 30 helpful.Please. And thanks.
__label__0 Camera pictures upside down no matter what I seem to do horrible on my kindle hd and I used some of my free coins for this...not a happy camper what can I do to return this get my coins back
__label__0 The only thing that it does good is zoom, That's it. Aside from that, It's a freaking worthless and useless app and a flat out rip off for a 3 dollar charge. Thank god I got it for free.
__label__1 By far the best standard camera replacement for Android.  Even Lifehacker recommends this app to replace your standard camera.  It has many more filters and effects than the &#34;redheaded stepchild&#34; of camera apps (Instagram), it has smoother proces
__label__1 Its my favorite camera app. I already bought on google store, but i am glad that i got it on Amazon too. It only defect in the lack of video camera app (the app launch the integrated video camera app if you want to shoot videos). But when it comes to pho
__label__1 I used this app on my first kindle and on my cell phone,so I couldn't wait to download it to my kindle HDX...It works fantastically!! Effects and clarity are superb...keep up the good work guys!!
__label__1 I got this ap for 10 cents and uninstalled 2 other effects aps. It does have zoom and plenty of add on toys. Only ap better is HD paid from Amazon to really improve camera shots on Htc TB with 8 mp camera. Also can change to front camera in ap.  thanks d
__label__1 This camera app is better than the camera that came with my phone. It's amazing! Use this app with Pixlr-o-matic app. In doing so you'll get some amazing pictures! You can then create what you like!
__label__0 I hated this it is not like the one I have on my cell phone and it crashes a lot I would not use this  and I will be taking it off
__label__0 I don't really see the need for this app. Facebook messaging is pretty good all by itself. Pass on this app
__label__1 Downloaded this to my Fire so that i could keep in touch with FB friends while on the Kindle Fire.Works effortlessly...is easy to use...hasn't let me down yet!!!Won't be disappointed with this app if you are a big FB fan!!!
__label__0 I did not like this app. I uninstalled it. There were too many ads. It was not easy to install either.
__label__1 This is hands down the best app for chatting on Facebook, I just love it, it also comes with super cute animated kissy faces & such. My mom loved it so much that she also added the app to her computer.
__label__1 I'm no longer on face book so  ideleted it from my tablet thank you very much much much muchwant to go pleae relase
__label__0 This app does not work for the Kindle Fire HD. I tried the app, and all it does is redirect you to the mobile Facebook page via an internet browser. Please bring the actual Facebook Messenger app to the Amazon Appstore.
__label__0 When I realized this was a chat app I immediately deleted it. Don't see the need for it at all with FB Msg.For those that like it, Carry on Dude!
__label__0 Same issues others had. Would not &quot;authenticate&quot; my account to log me into my Facebook. Could not use this app at all. Facebook just needs to make a messenger app themselves for Kindle Appetite.
__label__1 It helps me and my friend be on at the same time in chat. (Though I'm glad she trusts me for not answering them..erm..the messages 0: )I recommend you to use this apps.It lets you log into more than one account! :)I love it! I chosen this and it deserve

__label__0 anytime i would try to link my fb account it would just open facebook in the browser so i finally deleted it and got something else.
__label__1 This app is really easy to use,has notifications, and keeps track of messages when not logged on I recommend it
__label__1 This app was very informative and I used it all of the time. I love the articles that it has.
__label__0 I don't really understand why they even call this a tracker, it does nothing of the sort. It gives some information and tips on child care, but nothing you couldn't find by simply visiting their website on your mobile device. Baby ESP is the best baby tr
__label__0 In my opinion, anyone with a kindle fire should not get this app because it doesn't vibrate at all. I should have listened to the other reviews and not have gotten this. I'm going to delete this app now.
__label__0 this game shouldn't even b a real app because it is so stupid. do not get this game!!!!!!trust me its stupid all it does is makes a buzzing sound!
__label__0 waste of your f****n time like really all it does isvmake sounds it sounds like u r cutting hair but all it is is a blank screen with a razor in the middle and it vibrates ur phone or tablet. it is stupid do not get but I bet u got it by know if u r read

__label__1 Test device:  Samsung Epic, Android 2.2I never really got into the trading card games like Magic and the like, but got a passing familiarity with them and how they are played.  I decided to go ahead and give Fortunes of War a shot, mostly because I liked
__label__1 This is a strategy game with  lots of depth.  in the single player campaign, every level requires a different approach, sometimes you want to be aggressive, other times defensive, and still other times its just a race to the top.  the torn card style wor

__label__0 There isn't really much to do with the free version. Seems like an ad for the paid version. Want more before considering a purchase.
__label__1 I liked this game so much that I purchased the paid version. Lots of card options. Plays differently every time.
__label__0 hate it. so boring. ugly!!  uugggg!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  ! ! ! ! !! ! ! ! ! ! ! !! ! !
__label__1 Had a power outage last night and my daughter pulled this app up as a bit of humor. We both enjoyed it- it is a very cute app! Its a bit of old time nostalgia meets the techno age but reminds of us simpler times!
__label__1 Very neat app. Thanks to the creators, and keep up the good work. Works great on Cruz t408 very customizable.
__label__1 This app is very AMAZING!!!!!! I could see no adds and it was fun for me, I could and did play with it for with hours!!!!!!
__label__0 no point to it. it does nothing. if u want a good all try angry birds. this app is a waste of your time. don't get it
__label__0 Basically just a candle on a screen and you can adjust the flame.  If you want to waste time watching a candle then get it.
__label__1 I have a kindle fire hd and daughter has a kindle fire.  This app works on both.  She loves to use it at night, almost like a night-light, only its brighter.  With the sleep mode on the kindle, it doesn't stay on all night so its great for her to go to s
__label__1 My dog hates to have me stay up. She sleeps at the end of my bed, so when I want to go on the Kindle Fire and need extra light, I use my candle. Its really pretty and unique.
__label__1 This "Candle" app is just a little bit of fun for my HTC EVO 4G (Android v2.3.3) and Kindle Fire. We are professional candle makers, so like all things candle related.The app displays the top of a taper candle with an animated flame that reacts to the mo
__label__1 My son told me about this app and I have used it quite a few times.  At night when one doesn't want turn on a light this is perfect to give enough light to see where you're going.  Also use it when coming in from the car as we don't have street lights.
__label__1 Nothing is as good as a real candle of course but this is really cool. When you rotate your kindle the flame bends like a real flame. It really is nice,  I dont think it is animated I think its a real candle.
__label__1 This is a great app for the easily amused like me. It can be a little tricky to exit at first.
__label__0 This app is boring all you do is watch fire and touch it then it blows out it's to bad I can't take back my star:(
__label__1 In need of flameless candles that won't catch your table cloth on fire?  This app is for you!  It works well for setting that perfect romantic occasion.
__label__1 I haven't had much cause to use this yet, but the novelty is so worth it.  You can even blow it out!
__label__1 This is by far the coolest thing! I have yet to find a good purpose for it, but its simply that entertaining. You can extinguish the flame with your finger, and have the candle change colors! The best is that the flame looks extremely real!
__label__1 I love this app! You can change so many things!( candle color, flame color, smoke color and background color!) If you have a microphone on your device you can even blow out the candle! Fun app but not a game, kids
__label__1 This is really cool. You can change the color of the candle and the flame. If your tablet has a microphone you can blow it out. It is awesome. :),
__label__1 Remember - this is not a business app, it is not a gaming app, you are getting EXACTLY what the app says it is. A candle. It lights like a candle, behaves like a candle, lets you pick a color for your candle and is nice for creating a romantic atmosphere
__label__1 This is one of the coolest things they have come out with in a long time. It serves no purpose other than just being a neat toy!
__label__0 I installed it on my Kindle and it worked the first time, but would never work again so I deleted it.
__label__1 All the fun of playing with fire, without the consequences!Although, you should NEVER play with fire under ANY circumstances...it can be dangerous.
__label__1 I like this for roaming around the house in the wee hours of the night.  It does not disturb my sleeping family and gives me enough light to keep from tumbling down the stairs or stunning toes.This light tool does not shock your eyeballs.  Nice atmospher
__label__0 this is a dumb app u don't even do anything on this app just watch a candle burn and move. that's it how dumb u cant even change the color of the flame or candle. no use downloading it cuz u will just delete it after u try it.
__label__1 Watching the responses of the people who see me blow out the candle (you can!) is interesting. Most just seem to accept it as ho-hum. This tells me they don't have a clue about electronics.
__label__0 Will not, does not want to work.  Waste of time and effort attempting to load.  Had higher hopes, but all my best wishes for this product were for not.  Probably works better on a smart phone or iPod Touch.
__label__1 It's very simple but good to have. Sometimes I use it as a source of light, sometimes when I can't fall a sleep or want to relax
__label__1 Too cool for words.  You can even move the flame around when candle is out and you touch the candle wax and not the wick (ghost flame...ooooo!).
__label__0 This is just a flickering candle. Nothing special really. I would not waste my space on anything for this. Not worth it!
__label__1 I really like this app you can change background, candle, flame andsmoke color. very cool! the ads are small and doesn't bother me at all. love it
__label__1 Woohoo! I have a candle on my kindle! Yayyy! Ok, there's not really much of a point to this app, but it's kind of cool anyway.
__label__1 It works fine, is a decent little play thing, and can be nice little mood setter. I don't use it often, but I do occasionally play with it,
__label__1 I am not sure if I am bemused or confused by the low-raters who gave this app just one star because it was 'too boring' for them. Have any of them ever seen a _real_  candle? With a real candle, you light it, and it's lit. You move it, and the flame wave
__label__1 i got this ap purely for the fun of it as a silly answer to all those fshlight apps :)
__label__1 I'm kind of a pyro, so this a very safe alternative to actual flame. I love being able to change the colors of everything. I also recomend the lighter app if you like this one.
__label__1 when my husband is sleeping and i have to leave the room for a moment i out this app on no navigate through my room. works fine.
__label__0 Uninstalled
__label__1 I like this candle toy.  It is not intended to be a fancy game but it does what I wanted, just watch it and think clean thoughts.
__label__1 I want to use this when the power goes out. It is just perfect. Works just as it says and it is super pretty. Plus, no worries about burning down the house. :)
__label__1 Used it last month when the power went out to find my way back to the room with the real candles. It really works and is not just for show. Pink fuzzies to the creators of this app. Thanks. Will be fun to use it while camping.
__label__1 It's a nice little candle. Looks like the real thing. I have a kindle fire and it works on it. You can't blow it out using Kindle fire but you can touch the wick and put the flame out or start it again. It does have ads but I don't find them annoying. I 
__label__1 want a candle lit dinner for two?  just fire up you kindle, turn out the lights and there you go.  it looks and acts just like a candle except it doesn't get hot, drip wax or get the least little bit warm.  gives an almost real ambiance, actually romanti
__label__0 Its sooooo stupid! I don't even get the purpose for this app....it just does the same thing over and over and over again. Its just a waste of space. DONT GET IT!!!
__label__1 this app is fantastic, great, soothing, awesome, and sooo great!!!  it would be so cool if u could blow it out on the kindle fire!  I know it seems boring but so glad I got it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
__label__0 This is probably the lamest app I've come across.....ever. No clue why I even bothered installing it. Real candles are way more interesting.
__label__1 I've had this for some time. It works well on Kindle Fire HD. If you just want a break from it all.
__label__1 This makes a good low light.  For those of you complaining about it: 1) it is supposed to be a low light, 2) it is a UTILITY, not a game, and 3) you should only complain about it if it doesn't work on your machine.
__label__1 Why didn't I think of putting a candle on my Kindle Fire?  Oh, right, the warranty and wax and heat.  Everything Progimax touches is golden.
__label__1 Good way to organize my apps that looks nice, and doesn't cover the whole screen like the folders do for my Incredible2.
__label__1 CircleLauncher lets you place widgets on your screen each holding either apps, bookmarks or contacts (no mixing allowed) and, when you tap on the widget's icon, all the objects associated with the widget are displayed in a circle or a bar (horizontal or 
__label__1 Easy to use, cleans up panels. Think of it as folders for apps, contacts etc. Plenty of color and design choices for the widget. I now have buttons and lines of varying size, design and color on my DROID X2 - looks very clean and organized. Thanks Amazon
__label__1 I like this app better than "application folder". It is  quick and responsive when I try to access shortcuts through it. There are lots of features which is great!Still needs:1. better layout that handles shortcuts for more than 10 apps in one widget.2. 
__label__0 I really don't appreciate when companies try cramming extra garbage into their apps and don't even respect you enough to acknowledge what they're adding in. I did enjoy using this launcher, but who knows what else they are sneaking into this app. More th
__label__1 This app is a great way to save space and have all the Apps you use most on your he page. Highly recommended, get it today.
__label__0 I downloaded this app when it was offered free for the day. I thought it was a really neat app until a day later, some of my apps started disappearing. Not cool! I uninstalled it. Beware before you get this app.
__label__1 Simple, clean and handy. This basically is a short cut for your widgets.  The way it is organized makes it easy to launch your most used apps with one thumb. I am really enjoying the convenience of this app and appreciate the clutter clean-up. Works well
__label__1 CircleLauncher helped me to clean up home screens on my Toshiba Thrive.  I have created several launchers by theme (games, organizer, photo and video apps) and placed them on the home screens instead of the multitude of icons.  The home screens look very
__label__1 I tried the free version as as soon as I figured out how it worked (couple of minutes) I decided to bought the paid version. Im really glad I did I because CircleLauncher lets you group apps, contacts and shortcuts in a very cool and neat way while helps
__label__1 I tried other programs similar, and this is the slickest and most practical. If something is out of sight, it's out of my mind, so I love that the icons each hide tons of apps. It launches fast, and it's easy to see/read what you have. It also is fast. I
__label__1 This app gives me a nifty way to keep all my app shortcuts in a neat and cool way. The transparency option makes it a favorite
__label__1 Here is a favorable review of circlelauncher. It does a great job at being a good widget. Way to go dev.
__label__1 I love this app! I can put all my apps on my homepages, grouped like I want. Well worth the dollar cost!! Fantastic app! Droid X.
__label__1 Great app! It is EASY to set up, looks great, and works flawlessly on my HTC Incredible. I love that I can now select my most often used apps with one click, and my home screen is clutter free. I use the folder editor app on one screen to categorize all 
__label__1 I really like this app. Does take some time to set up. If the app isn't set up right the first time, no worries, just send the oops to the trash bin and try again.
__label__1 This app is great for older phones with a small screen (LG Ally). Trash all the cluttered Icons and add this widget to the home screen. Would have paid a $1 for this app.
__label__1 I absolutely love how this app allows you to have multiple shortcuts to all your selected apps in a 1x1 real estate space on your home screen. Less is definitely more, and this app reinforces that fact!The icon itself may not be the most beautiful, but t
__label__1 This app/widget is amazing. It makes life easier than before. Additionally it makes things more beautiful than just using folders. iOS users who have seen this were jealous! I love it. Well worth the price!
__label__0 This app can make phone calls without your permission! Homey don't play that. This is the first launcher I have seen that phrased it quite that ominously. No way will it find its way onto my phone.
__label__1 This app is great. It saves space on your home screen by allowing you to organize all similar apps or contacts into single 1x1 icons.
__label__1 "CircleLauncher" is a clever app that allows one icon on the home screen to be used to quickly launch apps that you preselect to be shown when you press the launch button. Setup and configuration of the app is very straight forward and it easy to make ch
__label__0 I halted the install and could not think of any reason an app like this needed permission to access my browser history.
__label__1 whoever developed this app os a genius!  its just what I needed to organize my apps and contacts. it compressed my home screen into just one simple button, my favorite contacts into one button and my favorite games into one button. I highly recommend thi
__label__1 This app does what it promises. Nice way to de&ndash;clutter my home screen. Works great on DroidX. Like that I can have multiple varying sized circles of shortcuts, Apps, etc instead of just the usual grid of shortcuts, folders all lined up like neat li
__label__1 i dont generally review free appofthe day, but this one is really nice.  it is basically a homescreen folder replacement that looks a lot better and with more options.
__label__1 Finally a useful widget free from the appstore. I like it much better than having to use folders.. best free app. in a long time
__label__1 This is by far one of my favorite apps &amp; makes organizing my collection of apps easy. I have icons organized &amp; labelled according to subject or catagory, such as audio, video, app mgmt, camera, etc. I also have many game apps &amp; have them orga
__label__1 Pretty good.  Now I can arrange my apps in a better way, like it. Got it for free, sweet. There are more spaces on my phone now.
__label__1 I love to hear people complain like they do about a free app.  there is nothing wrong with this app it does what it says and works like described.  I would have gladly paid the 1.00 price for this app.  it greatly de-cluttered my home screen
__label__0 Ok, I submitted a negative review for this app twice now and twice amazon has rejected it. What its up with that?On to my 3rd attempt at my negative review of this app. The icons are horrible. They ruin the entire app. After a little investigation I can 
__label__1 HTC person... its a widget.  press and hold on your home screen, go to add widget, and it will be there.  if not, uninstall, then reinstall.  issue with access?  don't install it.  it is a widget app, it uses your phones info to organize, not to troll, n

__label__1 I picked this up as an app of the day.  I love it.  It allows you to group apps or contacts commonly used together into one space on your limited real estate of your phone.  Simple groups like family allow you quick access to all those contacts while onl
__label__1 this is a good launcher and the different styles and colors are what sold me on it. reduced some clutter on my homescreens as well
__label__0 Does absolutely nothing on Honeycomb Asus Transformer. Doesn't even appear in the list of Widgets. Maybe Amazon and Developers ought to be a bit more diligent before listing Apps as compatible with various devices and versions.
__label__1 This is a great App launcher. It's exactly what I was looking for.I like Wave Launcher, but CircleLauncher having different launch groups linked to different launch buttons on your home screen is a very nice feature.I love being able to have more icons a
__label__1 Android folders are okay until you want to peck at the X and close them.This its the same spot to open as to close and on my evo3d can hold many more than just 12 apps.Win!
__label__1 This is so much better than folders! I love how easily they come up and pop back down, and doesn't distract from the screen. Setup is easy and I like how you can go in afterwards and further reconfigure it without having to reload it. Very useful, I high
__label__1 Keeps your screen clean and gives you a nice,  neat,  attractive method of launching your apps.  Very customizable,  and reliable.  No force close,  no errors.Galaxy S II
__label__1 This app not only redunces clutter of multipule icons on the home screen, but by grouping apps together allowing better organization.  Streak 2.2)
__label__1 This app is ready to use and customize. It is great to put my frequently used apps in the circle instead of going through multiple home screens.
__label__1 Very easy to set up and modify, much better than I was expecting. Definite must-have, especially if you love customization on your home screen. Thank you very much Amazon for the Faotd, I appreciate it.HTC EVO 4G
__label__1 This is a fantastic app for removing clutter from your home pages. It works much like having folders on your desktop, but it is much cleaner and has a better look to it then any other app I've seen to date
__label__1 So I was thinking about purchasing this app and then I realized it was free. Any-who, wow it's amazing. Works.wonders on my Samsung Galaxy Tab 7. Highly recommend it. :-)
__label__1 This idea was the first of it's kind and I never saw it used before. I enjoy the circle launcher and it's a useful shortcut to some of my favorite apps, looks good as well.
__label__1 This is hands down one of the best free apps I've gotten from the Amazon Appstore.  It's definitely worth a buck if you have to pay for it though.  It's easy to use and cleans up your apps nicely.  I have a ton of apps and before this app had a cluttered
__label__1 this is super cool. si te quiere leer este en espanol, no te puede por que mi gramatica es terrible.
__label__1 Great app that helps you organize and reduce clutter.  Easy to use and very customizable. Highly recommend.  Go ahead and buy it now!
__label__1 Awesome widget!Wish you could save a widget presets to use again and again. Or sort Apps like Application Folder or Folder Manager.Wish the app list showed the app image.
__label__1 This just saved my one screen a whole lot of real estate.  Live it,  hope it continues to work and be updated when needed.  Thank CL Devs!
__label__1 This is a very handy &quot;widget&quot; that does exactly what it is designed for.  Actually it is awesome!  There will always be some morons that don't understand how to follow instructions.This is a great app! Thanks Amazon!
__label__1 I love how I can hide apps under the main icon, it keeps my screen clean and neat. One tap and there's my favorite games!
__label__1 If you love apps, you will definitely love this one. Transparent, so I can enjoy my home screen, or any screen for that matter.  Can generate any type of launcher to suit my needs. This helps  organize apps by using classifications that fit my style and 
__label__0 Touch screen stopped working after installing.  Did a battery pull worked for a minute and froze again. Did second battery pull unistalled,  no more problems.  Buyer beware
__label__1 This is a GREAT replacement for using folders on your screen.  I can group the apps I want together and it keeps my screen nice and uncluttered. I have a background picture for a reason, and I like to see it. This helps a lot.
__label__1 I'm not exaggerating. I have been able to organize my entire device. I get to my apps faster. No more scrolling through the entire apps drawer and forgetting what I was looking for.MyTouch 4G
__label__1 I love this. It's just what I wanted. I don't need to clog up my front screen and I also don't need to switch to the side windows by scrolling left and right. Very good and extremely customizable. Worth the buck and of course thanks go to Amazon for givi
__label__1 This is a great widget.  I have been using it since it was first introduced.  It can be used in so many ways.  I use it as a stealth launcher on a homescreen with clock.  Awesome
__label__1 This app has become a must for me. it puts all my key apps at my fingertips in an organized fashion.
__label__1 This is a really smart app, total space saver and organizer. I now have these on my home screen grouping my apps together based on function and each launcher labeled appropriately
__label__1 These are the sorts of things that can't be done on non-jailbroken iPhones.  It really cleans up the user interface.
__label__1 This app is great. Permissions for calling, contacts, and browser history needed for calling contacts and browser bookmarks. Duh.When circle menu is displayed hold inside the circle to edit.Didn't list apps from amazon the first time but did every time a
__label__1 this app is a great way to organize your Apps and contacts for fast, easy access. great thing is that you can have many circle launchers, organize different types of Apps in them and label them. very well worth the $1.00 especially if you have a lot of A
__label__1 This it's one of my favorite apps to date. I like clean looking home screens. With this app I can make the widget transparent and barely visible yet with a quick tap I can have the apps and contacts within easy reach. Would like an option for direct text
__label__1 this app is fantastic. I use to have an iphone, and got sick of the uncustomizable home screens. This is what android life is all about.
__label__1 I grabbed this when it was the FAOTD a while back and I have used it on my home screen ever since. I love using it for my most common contacts, so I can access them with a touch.I will be buying this on Google as soon as the developers work out the bugs 
__label__0 If you're planning on using this on a Honeycomb tablet, don't bother. They don't say anything in the description, but this app is not supported on Android 3.x
__label__1 This is a very cool way to maximize the amount of space on your smartphone's home screen. An excellent way to organize your app shortcuts while reducing the clutter.
__label__1 I've been using the lite version of this for a few months now and I loved it from the start. Theres nothing fancy about it, so I don't want to over sell it...its basically a folder with some style to it. To sum it all up, I shouldve paid a dollar for thi
__label__1 If you run out of space on your home screens this is an awesome idea. You just press the app and more apps that you set appear.
__label__1 I kept my often used apps and icons in a circle -Ishmael on one screen. this neatly and easily replaces that!
__label__0 if u like circlelauncher you'll love wave launcher. with wave launcher im able to pull up a screen shot app and take a pic of what im doing ie.. during game playn. or flick on an app real fast while talking on the phone.  so on and so on.  you can be a l
__label__1 This is a pretty simple but effective app. It helps save real estate on your home screen while giving you fast access to 8-12 additional apps. A dollar well spent!
__label__1 this app helps clear the clutter of apps that usually cover a screen. the app is great because you can group apps together under one icon and then label them for ease of access. the best thing is that it clears a cluttered screen and apps are accessed wi
__label__1 Saves space and your not just limited to just one slot on your homescreen.  Use games for one,apps for another, it's great!Thanks developer, and a thanks to Amazon for all your doing to help the android community
__label__1 This is the best Android launcher I've seen in the last 3 years!  How could it have taken a dev this long to dream up such an elegant design?  Totally worth $1, although I got it for free :  Just get it!
__label__1 I was skeptical until I tried it. Fantastic applications and the type that needs to be app of the day more often. Put the circle widget on screen and select applications. Then when you tap it they show around the circle and you can launch.
__label__1 CircleLauncher is an indispensable app/widget on my phone, an HTC EVO 3d. It's something Google or HTC should have incorporated into their user interfaces. Elegant and practical way to save valuable screen space.
__label__1 perfect way to clean up your homescreen. use it everyday. love the different icon packs as well. you will not be disappointed.
__label__1 HTC EVO this is amazing It took 20 minutes to reorganize my face page and it was worth it. When I realize you can have multiple icons with different apps or bookmarks saved that's when I realized how cool &amp; efficient this app was. Prior to this app S
__label__1 The app works great and clears up a lot of clutter. I don't see any lag when it's being launched. Had I known about this app earlier I would have gladly paid for it.
__label__1 This is a great app ... you can combine multiple apps to display into this one touch of a button utility.  I use all my camera type applications on this and one touch and they all come up ... one of a kind widget, well worth they try, which will turn int
__label__1 I just downloaded CircleLauncher and tried out the widget. It's a interesting little thing. May help unclutter your home screen.I placed it on an unused page and loaded up about 8 apps.  clicking on the widget brought them up in a circle on the screen.  
__label__1 This isn't a sexy or "cool" app but it is extremely useful.  Setup a productivity, photography, or game launcher and put your favorite apps in. Make the launcher a circle or a drop down list.  Change the background by blurring it out or shading it darker
__label__1 really like this app and that i have only 3 home screens since 70+ apps launch thru 9 themed circle launchers!
__label__1 My 2 y/o loves it.
__label__1 My two year old loves this app. It takes a good amount of space but it is well worth it. The picture and sounds are vibrant and clear. Great app. I highly recommend it.
__label__1 My 3 year old loves this and plays it all the time. He especially likes to imitate all the sounds. Ended up upgrading to the better version.
__label__0 I liked st first don't remember it talking but now it does and my 2 year old is smart knows all his animals and there sound also same with vehicles and the noise they Make I know this is free but geese um at least have the right names and sounds so we ar
__label__1 My children are grown, but I got this app for a friend's child to amuse her while Mom stepped out for a bit.  This app was engrossing enough for the little girl that she hardly noticed that Mommy was gone, and now every time I see her she wants to see.  
__label__1 He loves this app he calls it the moo be aide he loves the cow on it makes watching my baby brother so much easier thank you
__label__0 This baby game was acting really messed up, and was making my Kindle slow. The app is also very boring for babies and others alike, which I found out once it had finally finished loading. Don't get.
__label__1 I don't got no kids I bought this 4 the heck of it I'm 10 this Thang is soo fun!!!!
__label__0 Looks good. Baby chooses from a category shown with cartoon icons.  A pic of the real "thing" is shown and the name of the thing is spoken.  Then the baby is provided with a completely different sound.  A truck may sound like a train.  The goat tweets. O
__label__1 My sister can NOT get her eyes off my kindle when ever she is playing it. U get 2 touch things (such as animals, interments, and household items. I think u should get it * only if ur geting it for a baby or kid.
__label__0 Just downloaded this and very disappointed. When you click on a picture the person says something different. For example, my daughter clicked on a donkey and the speech said &quot;Dog! Ruff ruff!&quot;. I will be deleting this app as it will surely only 
__label__0 My child did not like this app.  I did not like it.  We got the interactive books for here.  I like them a lot.
__label__1 my toddler absolutely loves this app.  the icons are big and easy enough that he can hit them his self.  there are plenty of objects to include the ones he knows with new ones for him to learn.
__label__1 Seems to be a well thought out piece of software.  It also has a section for a user name and password input per site. This is how I get my radio shows that I can't listen to for one reason or another.  It is detailed, so powerful, which is another way of

__label__0 Imagine if someone who'd never seen or used a computer or listened to a podcast were tasked with designing the UI for a podcast manager. What you'd get would almost certainly not be as badly designed as this. It's literally easier for me to just remember
__label__0 I finally found the right calorie counter that keeps track of your daily food intake AND your exercise calories burned and it's printable so if you're keeping track for six months you have a record!
__label__0 this list of about 100 things is very unuseful. Adclick should rethink this app and add about 5000 more foods. then we could use it. I will now delete it and search elsewhere.
__label__1 Nice app on my Kindle Fire 7&#34; HD. Very quickly finds calories associated with various foods. I use it in conjunction with my written record of daily intake of food.
__label__0 All the assessment s are incorrect. The listings are extremely limited. If you try to loose weight using this for a tool you are apt to gain weight instead. Even if the product is free it should be accurate
__label__0 This app is TERRIBLE and has very little information. It lists crazy things..ready?.In the eggs section.4 kinds ..and 1 is quail eggs.REALLY??Not worth  it.And its free ..thx  mary ann
__label__0 This game would have had a okay concept if you could get it to work. The game will start but will crash before you can even get to the middle of the first level. I deleted this game off my kindle and suggest that you don't get this game.
__label__0 it is so dumb just get angry birds PLEASE I NEG YOU DO NOT GET THIS APP it is the WORST app ever it is so stupid it is not a good app plzzzzzzzzzzzzz do not get this app it is boring
__label__1 loveitloveit. I love this game so much and I hope everybody else does to bro. (me and bro game get along).
__label__0 It worked fine for me on my kindle fire, but the game its self just sucked really bad... The worst App I've downloaded yet.
__label__0 I was hoping for the Word Worm game that is for pc's.  The layout on this faugh  word game is distracting the color is awfulIt refuses common words. ---No fun.
__label__1 I love word searches and this game is a challenge. I would recommend this game to anyone who likes a challenge. thanks Amazon for offering this free app of book worm
__label__1 This is a great game! My computer is down and I miss my bookstore game. But this version for kindle is so similar, I have really enjoyed it.
__label__1 I love word games.  This is great!!!!  It is not hard to figure out.  It is a challenge.  Amazon has some pretty good games for phones- tablets-pc's-and kindle fire.
__label__0 Really not very impressed with the game. Doesn't drop letters in any pattern that you can use to make words. Too many Consenance together, no vowels.
__label__0 This is not what I thought and am highly disappointed. I played Worm Word on the computer and that is what I thought I was ordering. That is what it described and showed when I ordered. But when I went to my Kindle, it was this game and not half as good.
__label__1 I have searched for a game comparable to Bookworm for years. Finally, I have found it!! I am so happy right now!! Great game!!
__label__1 I love this game and play it often.  It is such a challenge to try and beat the letters that are going to inevitably blow me away.
__label__1 I love word games and used to play bookstore yahoo. I lose track of time playing this game! I just recently downloaded it but so far no complaints! Great job.
__label__0 This game leaves a lot to be desired for someone who enjoys word games.  The dictionary is poor and there is little to no challenge.
__label__1 Love to play this game in all modes. Helps me unwind and think at the same time. Could really use a better word dictionary..many words I Know are correct the game does not recognize. Still fun.
__label__0 I'd give it no stars but apparently that isn't possible.  You can't play it, the game just stops unexpectedly.  Deleted it off my device already.
__label__1 Only change would like to see is either a better scoring system for the untimed version or just let you play untimed, unscored and unstopped.  Like creating as many words as possible but don't like playing with a timer....and that's purely personal.  As 
__label__1 This game is adictting! Sometimes I stay up to 1:00 am playing it when I should be sleeping cause I work. Worth buying!
__label__1 This is a fun and addicting game.  I can waste hours playing this.  My 8 yr old grand daughter loves it too.  I would recommend it for kids and adults.
__label__1 I like this app for my kindle fire. It's fun and challengingI don't understand the bad reviews for it.
__label__0 horrible graphics, unreadable.  nothing like bookworm.  don't try it. was of money.  big purchase mistake.  just learning.  will not repeat my mistake
__label__1 This is the best App,/ I have ever found,,install it in your Kindle,by all means,,easy  application,easy to understand,,great result,,Recommend for Kindle Fire,,you will hear it in the next room,!!Regardless of what the other Nerds Say in the reviews,,Yo
__label__1 This ape was recommend bon a forum and I must say it was exactly what I need to increase the volume of the speakers on my phone. The I initially got it for my speaker phone feature but I must say it took my stock music player to another level
__label__1 I had trouble with it at first but then realized I  didnt download it right and after I did it worked great
__label__1 It does exactly what I need it to, boost the volume on my kindle speakers. I've never gone above 11, so I have no idea how loud it can actually get, but usually anywhere from 9-11 is more than enough.
__label__1 This little program did in fact boost the volume on my Kindle Fire and I love the program.  Highly recommended!
__label__1 had this for a few weeks finally decided to try it out on my kindle fire which as you may have heard by now has terrible sound I mean its great for background noise or when u want to hold it close to you but yeah it sucks. anyway finally gave this a try 
__label__1 I love this app, It improves the sound quality and volume of the basic Kindle Fire (2nd generation).If you are looking for a better way to increase the sound for music, videos and the silk browser. This app is for you!
__label__1 I have hearing nerve damage and even with high powered hearing aids my hearing can only be restored to around 60%.  Distortion is another problem.  One of my favorite programs is Downton Abbey but often I have a hard time understanding but I just gave it
__label__1 I don't know how it works, but it honestly makes the kindle quite a bit louder! I was totally shocked!
__label__1 Yes it works great on the kindle Fire want to test itrun Pandora and set your main volume about half way then goto the Volume app and play with the controls remember there are twooptions speakers or headphones.You do need to be careful because it could g
__label__1 For me this is especially helpful while using the phone to play my music with an aux jack in the car &amp; it makes a big difference I was so surprised. I have tried others &amp; haven't noticed any difference. Using LG optimus s with custom gingerbread 
__label__1 I hadn't checked this app out, figuring that it was strictly for volume...but this app also provides an equalizer (which even most players don't), and one which doesn't require an engineering degree to use!  So crank up up the bass boost or a variety of 
__label__0 The new Kindle hdx is a very nice tablet - except for external volume which is not loud enough.  This app didn't help.
__label__1 Ive a Fire 8.9 HD, and I grabbed this app today. Works wonderfully. Boosted up my speaker volume, on kindle, my independent speakers, now to try my Bluetooth speaker out and see if it brings up the volume.Now my radio apps sound much better, my downloade
__label__1 I am so happy I got this volume control app. I have been using Bluetooth headset or speakers but it can be really inconvenient for casual listening. This works exactly as described. If you are an audiophile you may not be happy with the quality of music 
__label__0 AS others, tweaked all settings, tried everything - simply does not work. I had high hopes because Kindle Fire volume is pretty bad from factory. Shame and want my money back.
__label__1 It works great on kindle fire and now I can play my music louder, just don't set it high or it will damage your speakers
__label__1 This Really Works!It is amazing!I can now watch netflix without headphones! Best 2bucks I have spent! This really gives you lots of options when it comes to your sound on the kindle fire.
__label__0 I want my money back,I try with different apps.my own files,tune in,music Fm,shared, audiobooks,etc this app Does NOT work on kindle fire, how can I sue the owner.is useless.
__label__1 I have to say that I was a little skeptical about purchasing this app,  but it was WELL worth it. Volume+ gets an A+ in my book. Awesome App!!!
__label__0 I downloaded this app thinking it would help make my kindle speakers better on account that they suck (hello amazon are you listening! ) well this app does not help! there is no noticeable difference. Save your money and just download speaker booster for
__label__0 I have a kindle fire HD and this app removes the firm hard hitting bass.  There is no setting that improves the sound in any way.  sorry, but this app is a complete waste.
__label__0 This app worked as promised for all of 25 SECONDS, after that it stopped effecting my sound.  Will send it to the cloud until updates come out.  Do not recommend for Kindle Fire.
__label__1 I have a rooted Kindle Fire running CM7 and this app boosted my volume level by 200%. I can now hear the internal speakers from 10 feet away outside!
__label__1 I dont know what the other reviewers are doing, but I tested this app on the stock Kindle Fire max volume levels for the Hulu app, Netflix App, Amazon Prime App and on youtube.  On all the tests, this app dramatically increased audio levels on my device.
__label__0 I couldn't get it to work. My kindle's volume was not high enough so I bought this. I't didn't seem to help
__label__0 This app doesn't work, when i try to use custom eq ,the sound reduces considerably low making terrible noises ,i completely regret buying this crap that doesn't work i wonder how in the world this app gets 4 stars,it got me completely duped..save your mo
__label__1 The amount this raises the speakers on my unrooted Kindle Fire is fantastic. it turned a horrifically low volume device into a wonderful and loud device. Thanks dev! Only one suggestion: have it begin automatically on reboot, not a major deal, just would
__label__1 the volume on the kindle fire doesn't quite work for me. I like watching netflix while I'm grilling swimming bathing. now I can hear.
__label__0 It did not like this because it just didn't seem to do a thing for the stuff.I just deleted it.
__label__0 Absolutely no difference on kindle fire. Volume was measured before installation and post. Unfortunately nothing had changed. Highly suspect the &quot;great&quot; reviews came from rooted kindle fire owners. Shame...
__label__0 This is nothing, no information at all! I did not even keep it for a day. That is how bad it is!
__label__0 This was a very poor app.  You can get more information by going toyour state government site and look under there various sites onfarming, agriculture and etc.  Remember with Kindle Fire, once youdownload its there for good.  Safe the Cloud space.  Don'
__label__0 Its just a  very basic doc with info a 4th grader could have written. (with apologies to 4th graders everywhere)
__label__1 this app is okish but all it does is tell you tips on your lawn. I think that it is a waist of app space
__label__1 The Green Lawns Made Easy! ap is pretty informative, especially for someone who lived in the city with concrete all around & now resides in Dandridge Tennessee with so much grass, weeds & beautifil farms.
__label__0 This app was not worth $2.99 it should be free I deleted it, It was the worst, I use to love the game show Name that Tune, nothing like that and was very poor, also didn't work properly and kept freezing.....
__label__0 i dont own this app but ...if its guessing a somg kind of game you might as well get a game called songpop there is a free version and an ad free one for half the price of this game...you can even play socially with people and there are different genres 
__label__0 Vincent you really need to buy an English book. Your use of the English language is deplorable.  Wishing you luck with your studies.
__label__0 This app is a waste of money. If you what a good game. Get something like blood and glory. Its much better then this rip off.
__label__0 waste of money people 5$ and all you get is a sucky game do not buy this game shouldn't even be. 99
__label__0 did not like this at all. was boring. not good names at all and kept repeating the same ones over and over again.
__label__1 I only got this cuz if u have a bunch of ag dolls and you cant figure out a name this helps alot
__label__0 I don't like this app at all you will not like. no one will like it at all it stinks so don't get trust me its bad
__label__1 people need to calm down and get over themselves its a cute app and fun to see all the different names that pop up
__label__1 I love bananas,and I love when that weird man says &quot;banana&quot;.my freind and I laugh when I say banana.cute game.:)
__label__0 this game is probly the worst game for kindle fire or any other type of tablet don't waste your time!!!
__label__1 This is one of my favorote games! I didn't even have it for a day yet. The guy that says banana sounds just like my dad therefor it's hilarious. The only downside is that you can not save your bananna's outfit. Other than than that it is a great game wit
__label__1 My son is 4 and loves this game! It is so simple and silly, but he loves it and that is what matters : )
__label__1 i have not played it yet but i love banana's so much i know i will love it and yes i am kinda crazy
__label__0 &quot;Very basic&quot; is too complex of a description for this &quot;interactive story.&quot; With single sentence pages, no music, barely any sound effects, narration that sounds like someone sitting at their office PC, bland visuals, and one touch spo
__label__0 my children are 5 and 3. both said that's it? the animation and interaction were both seriously lacking. the story was weak. I would not recommend it.
__label__1 This book is beautiful in every way! Love the story, love the illustrations!!! You can read it to your child or your child can choose the read to me option and the book will read to them!! My daughter loves it!!!
__label__1 I really like this wallpaper.  My only problem is that the configuration screen is totally unreadable.  Otherwise, awesome!  Nice visual aid.
__label__1 I has no effect on battery life but looks so cool. It is pretty basic though, the Droid just melts and eyes glow. Does everything it says. I would love an update to maybe add some change for when you plug your device in, maybe change the eye color? Idk i
__label__1 I love showing it off to my husband. it is just too cute. would be cool if there was customization.
__label__1 Looks great on htc evo 4G. I let my battery die, just to watch the android melt all the way. This wallpaper doesn't seem to drain the battery as much as other live wallpapers.
__label__1 This is a really good wallpaper. It looks great and works well. I haven't seen any change in battery life. No problem recommending this one.
__label__1 this application is so cool my only issues is i keep turning the screen on so i can watch him grow. i wish i could change him to a different color other then that great application
__label__1 idk what some people are talking about, I have the evo 4G and the battery time is known to not be the best. but the depletion of my battery has very very little to do with this live background. I have been using this background since before I saw it on a
__label__1 absolutely love this app. subtle and cute. does what it says without adding to the battery drain. give it a shot, you won't be disappointed.
__label__0 I have installed and uninstalled this many times, but it will not run.It doesn't show in my apps list, my widget list, or anywhere else. Fortunately, it shows in my mManage Applications lost so I can uninstall it.
__label__1 REVISED: Cool ap. Finally loaded and works and looks pretty cool. Revised to 5 stars.Looks like a cool app. Loaded, but doesnt open. Uninstalled, reloaded, same results. Samsung Galaxy S 2 Touch.I will revise once it works.Dave
__label__1 I downloaded this for a fun diversion, but I found myself leaving it up.  It's nice having a &quot;live&quot; wallpaper that doesn't drink your battery.  No cons to report while using this app with my Samsung Galaxy S II.
__label__1 This is a pretty neat live wallpaper/battery monitor. It does exactly what it appears it does... as your battery life diminishes, the Android dude melts into a puddle. You can adjust the background colors (the top color, and the bottom color to which it 
__label__0 I installed this app and used it no problem. Then about an hour later I started getting these rampant notifications that were nothing more than spam. Mostly on how I am the winner of IPads, gift cards, etc. uninstalled and the notifications stopped. I ho
__label__1 I love this live wallpaper. I wish the image was better quality and I wish there was an animation when charging but I still think its an awesome idea.
__label__1 i love the idea of having melring android depending on battery and i love the android avatar guy but i thought the wallpaper would be cuter or not so boring, maybe more colors or something! pther than that its cool &amp;its really in sync with the batter
__label__0 it seemed like a nice app but once i used it, i realized that it wasn't fine tuned and deleted it shortly after. they need to work on it a little more for people to download it
__label__1 Informative, &quot;cute&quot; and a great way to show your android pride. Didn't kill my battery. Was a constant source of entertainment all day long. Everyone I showed cracked a smile. Give it a try, really, you just might enjoy it.
__label__1 Thia is a great wallpaper.  The addition of the percentage was a nice touch. And You can change the size of andy in the settings.  Big or small...
__label__1 so cute,  that stupid little android melting away instead of looking for a power source to recharge its batteries kaboom
__label__1 this is a great addition to my minamilist home screen,  I was able to ditch my battery meters,  and now just have beautiful widgets home.  works excellent on a rooted of droid.
__label__1 The &quot;Drains Battery&quot; review made me laugh--brilliantly put. It's a joke guys, think before you respond...&quot;at around 100% the normal rate&quot; = NO CHANGE. And &quot;a couple hours later, it was down to 95%&quot; I only wish my phone only 
__label__1 I like it, it's a cool background and does exactly what it says it does.  The only reason I don't really use it is that it's sort of a boring background.  Although, what I find boring someone else may find sleek so I won't down-rate based on a style base
__label__1 This has been a great wall paper to use, with an easy way to see where your battery is without killing it
__label__1 Neat idea. Looks nice, not with crazy, jumbled designs , no scroll, which I love, and free. Definitely worth the download!
__label__1 This is a fun wall paper.  The% at the bottom is also prety cool.  I also think I am getting better battery life.
__label__1 11-25:can now move back to sd card! only takes up couple hundred kb on card.  ;)  i love the settings that let you customize background colors and robot size.  well done!PRIOR REVIEW: ... I did really like this wallpaper but made mistake of installing up
__label__1 Just got this app today and I can't tell if it hurts battery life or not but I can't imagine that it would. It just changes the picture with the battery level to the next picture in the progression (much better than other live walk papers). Overall I lik
__label__1 This app does what it says. I set it as my live wallpaper for my Incredible 2 and is a fun way to maintain visual cues for your battery life. Update now adds a percentage of life left. Everything is in the background so it doesn't interfere with my apps/
__label__1 love this wallpaper. functional and cute and it doesn't kill my battery. I'm usually hesitant to download live wallpapers but this app is worth it.
__label__0 it is VERY low resolution.  all live walls are battery drains too.  maybe if i could customize colors and it was HD... i could use itnice IDEA tho
__label__1 This is a clean simple application that shows the battery charge status. Minimal battery consumption for a live wallpaper. I actually find myself trying to waste my battery just so that I can see the cute Droid melt.
__label__1 this is great. the android logo is cute enough as it is, but when you add it mealting in an adoable little puddle as your battery depletes, makes it even cuter.cant believe its free
__label__1 Graphics look very sharp and it functions on my HTC Incredible 2 without any issues. Also seems to use far less resources than other live wallpapers.
__label__1 so cute and I love him. what is there more to say? do you want my five star rating or not?
__label__1 Not mucb to say.  Works as intended and is easy on battery life for a live wallpaper. It makes my daughter sad when the battery is low.
__label__1 The updated graphics are much better. Cool to be able to change background color. Like the added percent readout, though it is somewhat small and gets a bit lost in my homescreen icon. Thanks for listening dev and adding in requests/suggestions so quickl
__label__1 Doesn&apos;t destroy battery life because it remains still till battery level depletes, but still provides a new appearance each time your phone is checked.
__label__1 Would like to see the ability to change colors but otherwise pretty cool! The little Droid dude is cute, but I agree that the eyes should glow only when charging.
__label__1 This app works just perfect. Very nice for a free app. Does not use any additional battery. Would be nice if the eyes glowed bright when charging. Droid2Global.
__label__1 Shows me in a neat way how much juice I've got left. Does what it says it does and that all that matters
__label__1 I love this background the moment I got it. It is unbelievably simplistic but aethetical and Useful! This background beats all the other backgrounds out there and it's free! I am more than willing to pay a buck for such a pleasing background.So what this
__label__1 needs a better landscape mode and it also needs an indicator by the android of how much battery life is left too. also needs to be more customizable like change background/color/how much battery life is left etc. other than that this is an awesome wallpa
__label__0 it ducks like totem eggs horrible controls horrible graphics horrible objectives horrible! IM WARNING YOU DONT PLAY IT. YOU WILL HATE IT
__label__1 Fun,  frustrating, and addictive! Easy to get started, challenging as you go,  and hard to guess how much time has passed as you play,  absorbing!
__label__0 This is the worst app i have played in a very long time!!!!  the visual is ok, but the game itself is boring, repetitive and tedious!
__label__1 THIS WASN'T FOR  ME  BUT  FOR  MY GRANDBOYS,THEY HAD A BLAST WITH IT.SO FOR CHRISTMAS THEY  GOT A 7 INCH TABLET NOW  THEY CAN PLAYWITH OWN
__label__1 Looking for an exciting game with rich graphics and a compelling story?  Than look no further!  Dante: The Inferno, brought to you by the hard-working development team of Another Good Time is just the game for you!  I love this game, and highly recommend
__label__0 The game presents itself as a clean, well-made puzzle/adventure through The Inferno.  Instead you get alot of bland graphics and a game that bores after the first few screens.  Don't be fooled by the description and pictures, this game is not very good.
__label__0 This *game* wants my phone # and info, network info, wifi info, and then open network sockets. What the...?!  Too bad because this game actually looks interesting.
__label__1 I hope Amazon updates the product listing to indicate that this single player game contains NO extra permissions! Did the developer fix it at the last minute? I don't know, but at least he or she did the right thing!
__label__1 Graphics are okay, but the gameplay is great! You've got to act pretty quick on your feet in order to survive, as well as use your head. Well worth a dollar as you can spend a decent amount of time on this and not get bored. The levels are challenging at
__label__1 I have added a photo of the Kindle Fire permissions page and as you can see no permissions are listed or activated.Game play:You have to collect all of the souls in the level to open the gate and exit. As soon as you collect the souls you have to move qu
__label__0 This game looks and sounds great. The game mechanics are great. The story is great.The controls are indescribably bad.If the control-cross was resizable and a touch less sensitive this would be a 5 star app.............as it is its 1 star crap.Its too ba
__label__1 this app is GREAT, very entertaining platform game. a great way to pass the time when your are board. there was one level with a minor graphics glitches but nothing big
__label__0 The game seemed like it would be fun. I played multiple levels but the more difficult the levels got the more frustrating the controls became.  Consequently, I uninstalled the app.  The graphics were decent and concept was ok but the controls ruined it f
__label__1 I played all the way through this one from the android market.  It had ads which why there might be the diff between free and paid.It turned out too be a really good game.  It starts easy and ramps up the difficulty as the game progresses, just like it s
__label__1 so I read a few of the review and decided to try the game, I played 8 levels before writing this review.the game didn't ask for no additional permissions , do that's a plus.there's is directional up down left and right .. kinda old school but it worked f
__label__0 until developers can justify these permissions with logical explanations to &quot;us&quot; end users I'm not going to give them my money even if its a faotd
__label__1 great game lots of fun i recommend it to anyone who likes puzzle gamez five stars out of five stars
__label__1 Dante's Inferno has a good core mechanic that is a pleasure to see used in such creative levels. The gameplay is smooth and the pace great for picking up and chipping away at a level or two. definately want to see how further levels progress. classic gra
__label__0 did not enjoy it. It is a puzzle game that depends on how fast you can move to avoid monsters and traps. It got boring real quick.
__label__1 To start with, I have to point out that this is not my type of game, so I have uninstalled it after a few maps.But I wanted to give some positive scores, because I see a lot of attention that went into this game.Yes, the controls are a bit itchy, but I t
__label__0 I did not get it.  I found it very boring.  Did not hold my attention.  Playing on Kindle Fire. Maybe it would be better on another device
__label__0 I downloaded the app and it began to install and could not install.  I attempted to install several times without success.  If anyone has any ideas let me know.  I would be glad to reassess the app if I can get it to install.
__label__1 OMG this game is so cute I'm 12 and I think its amazing totally I love it love it please get I so think you should
__label__0 I thought this was a game not somthing to tell u to do cetain things at certain time. that certain thing is something not for a 12 year old.
__label__1 I got it for my 3 year old daughter her name is Chloe and she loves it as long as she love it then I'm ok with that she able to take care of the baby. so people who gave it I hate it.  then what the hell is wrong with you ok get it
__label__0 nothing to do you just sit there and set timers and alarms for stuff to do. and there os somethings on there I would not want a 2 or 3 year old to see!! and pictures!!!!
__label__1 for all the people who say its boring this is not a game. This is to help with child care. So don't hate you haters. and again its not a game.
__label__1 I had an infant in the NICU for 3.5months. This app can be set to remind you to pump (which is what I used it for) as well as other cares for the baby such as meds. I will continue to use it when the baby comes home.
__label__1 its super cute and its like a real baby! she cries when shes hungry and stuffs.i totally recommend you guys getting this app!!!!!:) Have a Merry Christmas:)!
__label__1 I love it. I use it everyday and it has everything I could need. I use it for my toddler too.
__label__0 I hate this app and u should never get it. it makes like totally no sense and I uninstalled it immediately.
__label__0 For one: I thought u could make yewr own baby and stuff. For 2: Its just a schedule! I do NOT reccomrnd this app!
__label__1 I have really liked this app and its features. It helps a sleep deprived new mom stay organized. I would recommend it to anyone. Best part is its free!
__label__0 if y'all think that this is a game... its not!!  if you would go back to the description,  it says that it keeps track of sleep,  eating etc... DO NOT GET IF YOU DONT HAVE AN INFANT TO CARE FOR!!
__label__1 Sooo friggin useful; especially for a free app. It has many useful features. It makes keeping track of baby's habits much easier. I use it to help me remember which side I nursed on and to keep track of how often she eats.
__label__1 For being a first time mom this app sure does help out and remind on feeding times, diaper changes, and the other things needed to do :)
__label__1 I just love this app it keeps up with everything. no more forgetting what time baby ate or how much how often or how many it keeps up with it all.
__label__1 This app was a great tool to use when my daughter was first born. We used it to keep track of feedings, diaper changes, and her doctor appointment stats. We still use it to track her height/weight and love this app!
__label__0 two words man two words: don't getit doesn't make any sense and the first time i saw it i fought it was cute but now its (fart) bad!!!
__label__1 This game is for people that are going to start a family and I am I put this game because I was growing a family with my twins  and this made me think I am going to be a great father and I was very excited to see my twin girls there 8 months now I can't 
__label__0 wish it did a little more than it does, looks like i will go back to using color notes instead.
__label__0 This app looks so cool when I founded, then after installing it in my fire, look so dull and boring. Maybe needs an update. The menu options do not have preferences, so you can't customize the look. Too bad!!!
__label__1 I use this app often. I color code by plans so I can see at a glance what I have coming up. I also like the lists I can make. I use this for shopping and Christmas list.
__label__1 this is a simple and easy app. It is perfect for what I need, to keep track of the things I need to pu at the store and the bills I need to pay each month.would recommend it and its easy on my kindle fire.I love things that are not to hard to use.
__label__1 This game is definitely targeted at those who enjoy puzzles and have been looking to take them on the road.I am one of those people and missed this game entirely the first time around. In fact, I didn't even know that a well designed game for this genre 
__label__1 If you love puzzles get it because you will get very entertaining. It has great pictures and you can choose the puzzle pieces and if you want it to be hard, medium, or easy
__label__1 This is a very clean application with great graphics and easy touch control. The multiple difficulty levels assures everyone will find a compatible challenge.  Definitely worth the price.
__label__1 awesome app. I love puzzles , can not put this one down. different levels keeps you challenged. Great pictures to choose from. Love it\n\n\n\n\n\n
__label__1 Have always been looking for a great puzzle app. very challenging for adults or simple for children..  only app i have ever reviewed.
__label__1 If you are a puzzle lover, then this is a great app.  You can make the puzzle as challenging as you want, and I like the ability to use custom images too.  It's helpful that when you finally get the correct piece in the right place and orientation, it lo
__label__1 I like jigsaw puzzles, so I thought I'd try this game and I am so happy I did. I only play huge (48 pieces) and hard (no edges highlighted) as I enjoy the challenge, but others may like that there are easier options. And expansion packs of more images ar
__label__1 I think I somehow got this app for free once, but I would definitely pay for it. I've purchased the expansion pack, and it was worth it. Nice, smooth game play. Fun. And you can choose how hard you want it to be, etc. Great app overall. I can't think of 
__label__1 Like many puzzles in HOG. Varying degrees of difficulty add interests. Was FAOTD but I would definitely recommend for purchase.
__label__1 This game is great. The only thing I don't like is the music, but there's an option to mute it. For anyone who enjoys puzzles, this is for you. There's a very simple level, a medium level, and an even harder one.
__label__1 This has been a very enjoyable game. Graphics are well chosen and the options on the puzzle difficulty are very flexible.
__label__1 This is one of the most beautifully clean games I've played on my Fascinate. The colors pop and the jigsaw puzzle itself is very addicting. Challenging enough to keep you coming back, but not so challenging that you end up getting frustrated and toss it.
__label__1 couldn't put this down played with this app and finished all the puzzles in 1 day! love it on my kindle fire.
__label__1 love these puzzles awesome very addicting had free version then had to buy pro version love it well worth $ if you like puzzles you'll love this app
__label__1 this is a well designed little puzzle app that is a great way to kill a few minutes. very well thought out .
__label__1 This is a great app. a lot of fun. Fun to add your own photos. My grandiose like it also.
__label__1 I love the challenge of the game.  You can choose your level of difficulty, so it is challenging for everyone.
__label__1 I have tried and uninstalled many puzzle apps.  This is the best so far as challenging.  It is bit more like a slider.  I love the ability to use own image.  It would be nice to set up multi players as the kids love it too.
__label__1 Love the puzzles and how you can select the size and level of difficulty. Beautiful pictures that are very vibrant.
__label__1 All of my four children,  ages 4 to 8, love this game. Especially my 6 year old. He's always asking if he can work on the puzzles and unlock new ones for me. This is a good one for young and old alike.
__label__1 This is a fun way to do puzzles.  It is a little hard to move the pcs. but you will figure it out after doing the first puzzle  There are quite a few pretty pictures to do.
__label__1 This is a great puzzle to own.  You have various choices of level &amp; pieces.  What I like the most is that I have to solve it.  There are no hints.  Makes you burn some brain power!
__label__1 This App is so worth the price.  Now I got mine on the Free App of the day however, I wouldn't mind paying for it.  This App is endless...by that I mean, you can use your own pictures to create a puzzle.  The App keeps track of your completion time and n
__label__1 these puzzles are so much fun. they are nice to play when you can't seem to fall asleep at night.
__label__1 Very nice app! I really have no problems with it....honest. It plays well, has beautiful graphics, well thought out levels of play...you will enjoy this if you enjoy putting puzzles together!
__label__1 This is a very simple puzzle pieces game, but it runs smoothly and is a joy to play. Varying difficulty options as well as many picture choices (including your own) keep things from getting stale. Highly recommend.
__label__1 Got this as Free App of the Day. I don&apos;t like jigsaw puzzles but I love this app. Great photos and  endless ways to customize. I even used one of my own photos to make a puzzle. I&apos;d buy it, it&apos;s a great time killer. Love those free apps, w

__label__1 If you love puzzles you will love this game. It gives you choices of difficult, easy, and medium  and the puzzle scenes are really nice. I'm waiting for them to do a part two of this game.
__label__1 My 5 year old loves puzzles and this kept her (and my wife any myself) pleasantly occupied for quite some time.  They have added quite a few puzzles since I bought it and all of the puzzles are a very nice high resolution picture with multiple options fo
__label__1 This is one of the better puzzle games I have tried on my HTC EVO. The implementation is very good and I have played it for hours without any issues. The game basically makes mosaic pieces out of either the preloaded or your personal pictures stored on t
__label__1 I love an app that does a job well, with great presentation, and perfect functionality.  This app is one of those. IT WORKS VERY WELL!
__label__1 This is a wonderfully different take on the traditional puzzle experience. Gorgeous photos...varying sizes to choose from...and the new take on the jumbled up puzzle makes it even more fun!
__label__1 It's simple and fun, with colorful, artistic images and the ability to use your own. The developer has been great, providing regular updates.
__label__1 this app is amazing! I really enjoy how you can use your own photos as well. overall, it is a great game.
__label__1 I love doing Jigsaw Puzzle's. The graphic's on this one is great and the color's are so pretty and stand out. I love buying challenging puzzle like these. They are harder to put togethr but that is what is so challenging about these kind. I look forward 
__label__1 Works great on the Fire! Pictures are beautiful and puzzles are challenging. A puzzle game done right. Love, love, love it. Can't wait to try the expansion pack.
__label__1 The android market version was updated last week.  Why not this one?  Did you abandon the Amazon Apparently store?  Don't forget about what you wrote in the changelog over there mentioning the Amazon app stores awesome constructive criticism.
__label__1 But it is ridiculous to require 20 or more words in a comment so here you go, blah blah blah blah
__label__1 This is a fun and addictive slider puzzle game. I like the ability to choose how many pieces and the level of difficulty for each puzzle. If I just want a quick and easy time killer, I can choose the easiest levels, but the harder challenges are there, t
__label__1 I played this puzzle app on the Kindle Fire demo model in my local Target.  I came home and downloaded a couple of free puzzle apps to my own Kindle Fire, but I wasn't impressed so I paid real money for Spectrum Puzzles and I was not disappointed.  The p
__label__1 I find myself becoming very relaxed while being challenged. I like the fact that you can easily glance at the full picture when students stuck. A true brain game.
__label__1 I love doing puzzles and this app has some good ones. The pics pop right out.  the colors are very vibrant on my kindle fire hd. I love that the pieces can be rotated and are given in different positions. Others I have played has the picture in the appro
__label__0 Cool app but all the pics are unorganized. Took me hours to put them all in order. It should say &quot;some assembly required &quot; in the description!! Some ppl might not have the time to unscramble the pics.
__label__1 I haven't stopped doing puzzles since I got this. The graphics are great, there are varying levels of difficulty, and it's just all around fun.
__label__1 I downloaded this 2 hours ago and have been playing ever since. Have tried different sizes and difficulties as well as using my own images. works great, lots of fun. gotta stop playing and get something accomplished today!
__label__1 The demo version gives you a taste of the challenge ahead.  This isn't just a regular jigsaw puzzle.  It has difficulty levels.  On the medium level, the pieces can be rotated.  You no longer can use the edges to build a shell then fill in the blanks.  T
__label__1 Love playing with this app. Lots of puzzles to keep you occupied. Pictures are much better than the ones in other puzzle games I have tried.
__label__1 If you enjoy puzzles or just need a quick distraction from the chaos around you, then this app is perfect! It has varying levels of difficulty, and when you're ready for a new challenge, there are 3 other image packs available, albeit for 99 cents each. 
__label__1 I down loaded some time ago and kind of forgot about it. In the process of cleaning up I rediscovered it. Been playing every since.  Beautiful you l bright colors . Aesthetically pleasing as well as fun!
__label__1 I really like the pictures that this uses, they are really colorful and make putting together the pictures fun. I like how you can choose the level of difficulty so anybody can play this and have fun with it. It does suck a bit of battery power, but I ha
__label__1 These puzzles are both lovely and interesting. They also offer a variety of ways to play. I have the expansion pack and the spring pack, and would really enjoy MORE puzzles please.
__label__1 I thought this app was going to suck! But I thought I would download it and try it. IT IS FREAKING AWESOME! BEST PUZZLE APP EVER!!
__label__1 great looking game that&apos;s easy to learn and play. keeps you busy for two to twenty minutes. really enjoy it, great job dev
__label__1 I have enjoyed the puzzles in this app, the size and difficulties settings allows for many different age and ability groups to use. Have used this app with children and adults. Really like it. I am buying the expansion pack.
__label__1 Love the puzzles, love the pictures, love the fact you can keep getting add ons, the only downfall is that all the puzzle pieces are squares.  However, being able to select the puzzle piece amount makes up for it.
__label__1 Beautiful and full size pictures/puzzles on my tablet (running Honeycomb 3.2).  It is intuitive and easy to play.  I didn't get this app for excitement, but rather because I enjoy puzzles.  The developer didn't put in unnecessary permissions.  To top it 
__label__1 Lots of options and ways to increase and\/or decrease the difficulty. It comes with many images, but you can use your own as well.
__label__1 I do love this app. I only wish the peaceful music also played during the puzzle. Can't install last update tho.
__label__1 Even though this game is $1.49- its worth the price. Spectrum Puzzles is a jigsaw puzzle. They give you tons of pictures to do. You have a choice after you pick your picture-small (12 pieces), averge (20 pieces), large (30 pieces), and last but not least
__label__1 Author has addressed issues with early release and this is now a fun, solid app.  I certainly do enjoy playing.
__label__1 Fun app with enough variety to keep me entertained. Contrary to other reviews, this installs and works just fine on my Droidx.
__label__1 very simple to use and a great app for kids.  My son is enthralled with it and the variety of difficulty levels leave room for him to grow.
__label__1 The idea of using a custom picture for a puzzle has been around for a while, but never executed well. This dev carries it through very well in this app and even adds new features in the mix. Highly recommend.
__label__1 If you enjoy puzzle, this is truly a fun set.  I love the different levels and the pics are pretty
__label__1 Been playing it now for about 2 hours, this would be worth paying for.  Really addicting. Making the review a minimum of 25 words is stupid.  As Mark Twain said, why should I use officer, when I get paid the same for cop.
__label__1 The puzzles are colorful and the subjects are fun.  Since downloading a few days ago, I have already done many puzzles.
__label__0 If I want a puzzle game like this there are hundreds on the market already for FREE so why would anyone pay $1.60??? Come on Amazon wake up!!! This is nothing new nor fun. I&apos;LL PASS!!
__label__1 Definitely would recommend this game. Great while listening to podcasts. Lots of options and the ability to make custom puzzles from your own pics.
__label__1 This is a fun and easy to use app that I've been running on my Droid Incredible without problems.Pictures are provided and start easy, move up to difficult and are played using a small number of pieces or a large number of pieces (all pieces are squares)
__label__1 Here's the caveat...you get this one and then you get hooked on the puzzles so you HAVE TO get the additions.  They aren't expensive so I ended up with all of them.  I wish they made more.  You can choose how many pieces and the difficulty level.  It has
__label__1 This is a fun app. The puzzles were cool and a range of skill levels. I had fun playing this app. You should try it.
__label__1 Wish it was free, but that's okay, I got it on free app day. The game is good and the puzzles are hard. Just wish the images were harder
__label__1 got this app several days ago and love that i get to choose how difficult or how eady i want my puzzle to be.  and the pictures are beautiful.
__label__1 I love being able to use my own images. Sweet little app that I keep coming back to play.  Easy to use.
__label__1 There are times when you want to have a brain break.  This app is perfect for that. I love that you can choose the number of pieces along with the level of difficultly.
__label__1 really like playing this. I like puzzles and these are fun and challenging. really gets you concentrating. your pics are really neat. :D
__label__1 I love jigsaw puzzles, but Spectrum has taken it to a new level. Fantastic! My hope is that the Spectrum puzzles do not end anytime soon.

__label__1 This a very good game if you like puzzles. Really like that you can pick # of pieces and difficulty. Enjoyed this game immensely.
__label__1 Don't want to stop playing.  Like the way you have chance to choose you level and number of pieces.Also the hep when you are really stuck.
__label__1 Please make another application identical to this and I will gladly buy it. Love it! Can't get enough of it!
__label__1 love it!!!!!!!!! lots of puzzles,really liked making my own!!  the Colors are really bright and clear. hope to see other puzzle apps****
__label__1 I love this app. Beautifully colored puzzles. Each puzzle has 4 different puzzle sizes, amount of pieces, to choose from along with 3 different difficulty settings. So the same puzzle has several variations to it. Can easily be set up for your kids and t
__label__1 Although most people will say I (or anyone who gives a good rating) is the developer, I&apos;m not. Just wanted to say I love puzzles and this does what it is supposed to do. It&apos;s fun, runs great, great graphics, does what it says. It&apos;s nice ge

__label__1 Neat selection of pictures, definitely varied levels of difficulty. Gameplay is straightforward, but interesting enough for at least some replay to get faster scores.
__label__1 ok...some have rated this puzzle a 1 star for reason of bugs. I'm using the Fire and the puzzle does closes down many times (and it does iritate me sometimes lol), but I still would give it 5 stars (even ten if I could). This has been the greatest jigsaw
__label__1 I don&apos;t like picture puzzles in the real world, so I wasn&apos;t even seriously considering this application. However, since it was free, I installed it. Believe it or not, I actually enjoy working these puzzles. For that reason, I have to give this
__label__1 I really like this app - especially that you can use your own images. That aspect really expands the options.

__label__1 Really like this puzzle game its fun and enjoyed it very much.  Do recommend to others. Easy to use and fun for all ages.
__label__1 My first spectrum puzzle, and I love it.  The puzzles and all of the different available levels of difficulty are fantastic.  I haven't even counted the number of puzzles, let alone how many variations.
__label__1 I love puzzles so really enjoyed this app. Wish there were more puzzles in the free version. Ended up getting another puzzle app (very inexpensively) because I found this so enjoyable for short bursts of time to kill.
__label__1 Very generous number of puzzles are included along with three levels of difficulty.  If you get stuck on a puzzle you can select to make it one level easier without loosing your place.  They also have an expansion pack with  even more puzzles.  I can't p
__label__1 Well designed, easy to use interface with beautiful &amp; colorful photos. I&apos;m not much into puzzles but thought I&apos;d try it as it was FAotD today and was pleasantly surprised! \nIf you like puzzles I&apos;m sure you&apos;ll love this!\nWell don
__label__1 Great game works well on every level. people complaining now on the fact that there&apos;s no permissions, if there was they&apos;d have slammed it but come on really no permissions! You people are way too paranoid.\n
__label__1 Great for the whole family! I appreciate the fact that there are more puzzle pictures released now and then. My daughter enjoys how easy the game is to use. We also like that we can select how easy or difficult the puzzle is.
__label__1 Very good game, well worth the price.  Simple concept, but very well executed, and way above par for Android apps.  Works flawlessly on DX and wife&apos;s Tbolt.
__label__1 This is an app for the puzzler. I am hooked. Great oportunity to modulate difficulty, with great  tableau. Have to be thoughtful when i start as I will not want to stop soon
__label__1 It is a very good puzzle game, I like making puzzles out of my own picture gallery. Def 5 stars
__label__1 This is a real good puzzle game if you like puzzles. You can play this for hours without realizing it.
__label__1 Very fun little puzzle game. I liked the images used. gameplay is good. Wish there was some music during the puzzles, but the menu music is catchy. Glad I d/l'ed.
__label__1 First jigsaw puzzle I have tried and glad I did.  Addictive and fun.Looking forward to trying different options offered.
__label__1 No problems so far. I have played small and large puzzles with edges showing. Good variety of images. Wish the puzzle pieces were jigsaw, not square. Other than that, no complaints.
__label__1 This game requires no permissions! I installed it right away because the game looked appealing, and it was. The gameplay is very simple, as it explains everything right from the beginning, that&apos;s how it&apos;s supposed to be done, take note, to all 
__label__1 Not a typical jigsaw puzzle, more of rearrange/properly arrange squares.  All the same it's fun and works very well.  Lots of options for increasing difficulty.  A very nice app.
__label__1 Spectrum is great fun. The puzzle variety keeps it interesting and you can choose your difficulty level for each one. You can even change the difficulty while you are solving the puzzle! Looooooove it! Spectrum has options to buy additional puzzle packs 
__label__1 This is good to keep my brain active and sharp.  It is just challenging enough so that I am  not bored.
__label__1 Fun game that is very simple and easy to play, but really fun and challenging. One of the best free apps offered. Works perfect on Epic 4g
__label__1 I really enjoy this game/app. I love doing jigsaw puzzles but really good physical ones are expensive and take up a lot of space. Also, I have pets so there is really no place to keep a puzzle safe while you complete it.These video puzzles are a great so
__label__1 I play on kindle fire h.d. works great no problems . Beautiful pictures, multiple game play. If you love puzzles this is a must play app. You move the blocks around to complete the puzzles. Enjoy the game everyone. =^**^=
__label__1 East to use UI; beautiful, colorful pictures. LOVE the ability to enter in your own photos from your camera. Lots of different levels for each picture so it will take you awhile before you get bored of this. I would&apos;ve paid for it.
__label__1 I stayed up late and started playing Spectrum Puzzles. Now I can&apos;t stop! It is soooo addicting. Worth $1.60? Easy answer: yes!
__label__1 I love puzzles of any kind,but this one is a little different which was a pleasant surprise, can't wait to put more puzzle together....
__label__1 If you're a traditional puzzle fan, Spectrum Puzzles is the ideal app. Not only does it present a number of puzzles, it gives you multiple ways to work them; 12-48 pcs. Sometimes pieces may be difficult to recognize, but the game lets you know when you h
__label__1 First of all, I am a huge fan of puzzles and this was definitely a pleasant surprise to see as the free app of the day in the Amazon app market.  I downloaded this app thinking it was going to be limited to just a few stock images and not that fun, but w
__label__1 Great puzzle game!  Love using my own pictures as the puzzles!  A great game to pass the time while traveling.
__label__1 Downloaded this first thing this morning!  Simple but great!  This is a fun app that both kids and adults can use!  Works and looks super on my Samsung Fascinate.
__label__0 this is a first for me it says it is free but when you go to download,  it says the price has changed since I looked at it.  then I cancel the download a go back an it is still advertised as free!!!!
__label__1 This game is fun, the puzzles can be played at lots of different levels allowing them to be played according to how much of a challenge is wanted. There have been no glitches on my Kindle Fire. Highly recommended!

__label__1 I like this game so much that I went and bought  all of the expansion apps.I have spent many an evening going through all sizes and difficulty levels.Can't wait for the next batch of puzzles. I am HOOKED.
__label__1 Fantastic for exercising brainpower. Plenty of different pictures and difficulties by varying sizes. Kids love it when you create your own.
__label__1 This is a nice, simple game for anyone who is a fan of jigsaw puzzles. Great time-waster on the go.
__label__1 Gorgeous images, tons of difficulty and image options to customize, and set up in a fun progressive fashion that unlocks other images as you solve. Plus you can use your own custom images if you choose! Glad I found this one!
__label__1 The game is actually very fun. It definitely has the &quot;just one more&quot; effect on you. Next thing you know you&apos;ve blown through an hour just rearranging puzzle pieces. Nice clean UI, none of the usual permissions that will scare the conspirac
__label__1 This App was fair, and my children enjoyed the games and the endless hours of fun for families and friends and when you have nothing to do

__label__1 Picking your bonus round is a real hoot. Game is a lotsa fun. Works fine on Kindle HD.I can play for hours and not lose a real dime. Highly recommend this game!
__label__1 This is a wonderful graphic game very realistic play.  We go to the casino boats once a month and this game has proven you can play and not pay (out of your pocket).  Was worth the money.  Works well on my Kindle Fire HD 8.9, have fun!
__label__1 Love this game but after acquiring about 42 million it froze up on me. I deleted it and tried to download again but it won't download. Very disappointed!!

__label__1 Boost Mobile CDMA allows unlimited data with no-contract at $15/mo. T-Mobile also has a GSM plan that's $30/mo with unlimited data and 100 voice minutes. Exceed those minutes with this app! My friend uses this on Boost CDMA with no issues! I can always r
__label__1 If you have a phone or tablet with no activated account, this is a great way to use it as a phone. It sets up easily with your (free!) Google Voice account, and works over 3G/4G or wireless. Amazon has a great price for it, saved me $3.00. Voice quality

__label__1 I tried the free version and immediately downloaded the paid version (which is a great price for the amount of puzzles) once I finished the puzzles. It's great to be able to choose difficulty level. It's a challenge, but not impossible - perfect!
__label__1 There are 10 puzzles.  There are 4 playing options:  12, 20, 30 and 48 pcs which is like playing each one 4 times.  The BUT part is you have to purchase the other puzzles offered if you want to have more puzzles.
__label__0 Freezes while you are working on it shuts down the kindle, wish the developer would fix these things as they've been told about it many times.

__label__0 It only lets you play six pitcher puzzles then if you want to play more you have to by the non free virson so I woulb not get this stiled game.
__label__1 This is such a great app, I love the pictures and this keeps me  entertained .graphics are good and I like the content of the pictures.
__label__1 This puzzle is very entertaining, shared it with my sister and she loved it too. All ages, all levels and if you buy the upgrade you can do your own pictures.
__label__1 This is a great app. I have the full version & even bought the expansion pack. You can go back and do the puzzles at different difficulty levels and it also lets you use your own photos or pictures so it's really unlimited in the number of puzzles you ca
__label__1 I downloaded these for my son..and now I'm hooked..I really like the graphics in each picture and then there's the puzzle piece amount..I have down loaded my next three puzzles already..They have a challenge to them and I like that...keep them coming.
__label__1 The calculator is so easy to use. It provides the amount of fabric to purchase for various aspects of quilting in matter of seconds and eases my concerns of buying enough fabric.
__label__1 I'm making two quilts and I needed to figure the material for the backs. This was quick and easy. Love it!
__label__1 My wife, who is an avid quilter saw this program at a get-together and says this is fast calculating, and a great service for non-computer users and very easy to understand.
__label__1 Great quilting tool since this is what I do.  Have not used it yet but I am sure I will soon
__label__1 I love the QuiltCalc.  I own a quilt shop and it makes things easier and faster.  Don't have to try to think on days when we are busy.Glad I could download it on my Kindle Fire.
__label__1 This is a fantastic app and a GREAT and handy quilting tool. I love Robert Kaufmann fabrics and this app provides another reason to love this company! Thanks RK!
__label__1 I love the options, particularly the calcs for setting triangles, my personal measurement nightmare! Well-thought out. Love that ad pops at the start then doesn't show in calc. Love description of how to use each calc. Great app, RK!
__label__1 I work in a quilt shop and this is very handy to use to get the information you need. You would be surprised how many customers come in for us to figure out what they need; but that is what we are there for.
__label__1 Got this to test it out to recommend to my quilting customers.  Love it.  It's so easy to figure out what you need in fabric for a project.
__label__1 The QuiltCalc App is an excellent easy peasy tool for quilters, whether it be for just beginners or pros. Great app to have for all quilters at your very fingertips.
__label__1 I've only looked through it and checked out a couple of calculations, but this could really save me time and frustration. And it was FREE!!!
__label__1 This is sooo convenient to have with me at all times. Wonderful little tool if you're a quilter. I especially like the piece count option. You can specify any size piece you're cutting. The other calculator only allowed for squares or triangles, but not 
__label__1 I got this app because I have a hard time figuring out how much backing fabric I need. Usually have to make another trip to the store but with this app I haven't had too. Very helpfull app.
__label__1 Quilters calculated is sew handy on my Kindle fire HD.As a quilter,it takes alot of the guess work out of how much fabric you need for all your quilting projects.And this would be an awesome app for any of your quilting friends.
__label__1 This is a fun, old school dungeon Crawler with excellent graphics.  Very addictive!  This is anexcellent example of a mobile app that hits the sweet spot of easy to learn with a good amount of depth.  My only gripe:  I wish it was easier to organize your
__label__0 I am not necessarily a fan of this type of game, but I tried it only because it was offered free. Slow, cumbersome and no directions. It is not fun when you are guessing what to do. Got bored real quick.
__label__1 If you liked Wizardry or Might and Magic, you'll love this game. This was a great trip down memory lane.
__label__0 Like I said for the title why is in the TOP FREE if its not free? I almost bought a app that I would later forget about and delete. It said Free people but its not free. It looks fun I wish I could have gotten it but why buy something you know later your
__label__0 I usually like these games, but this one was really boring! Same thing over and over and over. One problem is having to go back several levels to get more keys. YUCK!
__label__1 My ONE complaint: Ow, my aching thumbs/fingers!There are a miscellany of minor &#34;get used to it&#34; hics and ups but over all, if you ever loved the classic &#34;Dungeon Crawl&#34;, you'll love it. The mobs don't respawn (a single tear rolls down my 
__label__0 I bought this for my daughter and son my daughter is 8 and my son is 9 but they thought it was boring so I tried it but it was boring to me. BTW when I got off the game the music keep playing so I removed this game don't waste ur 99 cent if it does that.
__label__0 After reading the reviews I really wanted to try this game.  After downloading my s4 scanned it and it said test security access.  I instantly Uninstalled this app.  Why would they need to test device security?
__label__0 This is the worst game I have ever downloaded.The controls on this game are awful.The game play is boring and repedative and pointless.I uninstalled after 10 min.of play I could not stand one more min.Do NOT WAST YOUR TIME TO DOWNLOAD!!!! The only good r
__label__1 Many hours and several dungeon maps into this great game I when trough the door and the end of the level and got the "to be continued"...... argh!!!  This game is really fun, can't wait for the update or second episode whichever it will be.  Since I unin
__label__1 Decent graphics and sound, a tad to easy to get lost, love all the goodies available. For free it's worth twice the price!!
__label__1 Played this as a demo a while back...liked it then -like it now i got full version.. graphics remind me of early  nintendo games i loved
__label__0 I kept dying so i just stopped minutes in. It was free and i deleted it from my phone within 15 minutes...
__label__1 Deadly Dungeons takes you back to the days of Ultima Underworld and Eye of the Beholder and does so in a very good way. It's a pure first-person POB dungeon crawl with decent graphics, intuitive controls and good level and monster design. I have only one
__label__1 Wow, just finished the whole game. It was a classic dungeon crawl and looks a lot like the similar games from many years back. It does have the somewhat repetitive nature of these games, but if you play through 2 to 4 levels, you get a new kind of dungeo
__label__1 This game definitely calls to mind a few of the old school dungeon crawlers that I played way back in the day. It's  pretty fun with decent replay value. :)
__label__1 A little difficult to maneuver at first, but once you get the hang of it, it's fun. Great for a stop-and-start day, and even for a couple hours.
__label__1 I find this to a very compelling RPG. The story is not particularly deep, but it is deep enough to make sense of the bosses at the end of each section. There are no puzzles and most of it is very straightforward. If you like clearing out levels of monste
__label__1 I got this as faotd and didn't open it till later when the dog needed to go out at 3am.  while I waited I started up this game.... the sun had come up when I stopped for a break. lol. let me just say that sometimes simple is better.  I have subs in big m
__label__1 This is not my type of game, took it as the free app of the day, just to try it.  But my Grandson loves this game. He says great graphics, and I believe he said 3-D and it seems to be right up a gamers alley.
__label__1 I didn't expect thus game to be this good. The only thing I would add is an option to delete characters. Great game, worth the money.
__label__1 nice well thought out dungeon crawler the  permissions it request make sense as well witch is always a plus not having stupidly outlandish permissions.
__label__1 This game is like a classic FPS dungeon crawler you just haven't played before. The mechanics are rather simple, which only add to the addictive gameplay. There is a tremendous amount of customization to allow you to build the type of character you want,
__label__1 This has become my new favorite tablet game.  It lets you advance as a character, gear up, not too crazy of a grind.  I have been playing RPG's sine Bard's Tale on the Commodore 64, and they are by far my favorite style of games.  This is very reminiscen
__label__1 BEST GAME EVER! It's like the monsters walk up to you and you have to kill them? Well haave fun!With the game of course!
__label__1 This is just like Mazes of Fate for GBA and I love that game. Worth the dollar it costs. x
__label__1 There are a few issues that could be better, balancing seems way off after transitioning to a new area, flipping the portrait mode so that my headphone jack is at the bottom, allowing belts to auto inventory potions when you use one and the inventory scr
__label__1 Did you play PC games from the time Atari 2600 was on store shelves till Playstation 2 was released? If you were like me you avoided all the consoles in between that time because they never had good dungeon crawlers or DnD-type RPGs. Deadly Dungeons is a
__label__1 I am hooked can't put it down because there is always another monster to kill. keeps me in suspense on what is through the next door.  worth buying for sure!
__label__1 awesome and fun.  I will not uninstall this, and I uninstall a lot of things I end up not liking.
__label__1 I grew up playing a multitude of D&amp;D style RPGs in the late 80's and 90's on the PC, and this was a welcome return to those days. The graphics are decent, and it can get a bit repetitive at times, but man is it hard to put down!There are some very ni
__label__1 Enjoyed playing through this one immensely. As others have said, great replay value. That being said, I wish it had a little more depth. Ended the game with thousands of gold that ceased to have purpose. The variety of special gear you find is pretty exc
__label__1 If you're looking for a good time wasting RPG then this game is perfect for you! I have only had this game a couple days but I have multiple characters already. I like how each new characters starts out like a blank slate and you get to choose exactly ho
__label__1 I got it last night and turned it on to try.  I couldn't put it down. It was 2am before I could tear myself away. Deadly dungeons is addicting!  Lots to choose. No in app purchases. No adds. No must give a review to play. A complete old school dungeons a
__label__1 I found this game to be totally absorbing. This game plays very well and to date this has got to be my favorite
__label__1 I grew up playing first-person 3D dungeon crawlers back on the Apple ][e, Commodore 64, and the venerable IBM 8088 when shareware games came of 5" floppies in magazines.  Back then, consoles were in their infancy and NES was nearly a decade away.  If you
__label__1 This game is really great. It reminds me of all my old favorite RPGS on the NES and SNES, only better! Many improvements were made to that old engine and layout, such a surprisingly epic music score and the ability to look around yourself outside of turn
__label__0 I appreciate someone or a team of people wrote this, but I can't get past the lack of control, the world of 90 degree movement is not fun. Galaxy SII
__label__1 Okay, so I had found this game a while ago and I immediately wanted. However, I didn't want to pay for it right then and there, so I added it to my saved for later list.Lo and behold, I am glad that I waited! I love the FAOTD part of the app store.Though
__label__1 This is like the original &quot;Eye of the Beholder&quot; type RPG. You pick a charactervand start playing.  A couple of hints...use a bow...concentrate on building up on type of magic spellband save often.
__label__1 I have been super hooked on this game...it is so reminiscent of the old might n magic games I played growing up...I love it!! I wish there were more Apps like this one! it loads quick, u can save multiple characters...tons of items ...I love it!
__label__1 I've played them all, all the way back to Wizardry 1 on an Apple ][ and Alkabeth. I've solved every Infocom text adventure. I solved the cassette release of Empire of the Overmind (I still have it too, in the box!) and every Scott Adams adventure ever ma
__label__1 This game has been on the top of my list for awhile now and I finally decided for a dollar what the heck. Turns out the pictures do not do the graphics justice at all. This game is actually pretty awesome for. The retro style makes this game what it is a
__label__1 Great graphics and it moves as fluid as water, although it's also pretty hard to get started. Definitely one of the better dungeon crawlers
__label__1 Ai love this, but you should be older than 12 to read in my opinion. l. I love the storiee
__label__1 ok everyone is like it has bad spelling or inappropriate stories well it doesn't im11 and even I thought the stories were pretty hilarious so back off hatersr
__label__1 it was really funny, but after like 60 stories (doesnt sound like a lot, but if you read 2 a day it only goes for a month) it just goes back to the beginning
__label__1 i love this app. i was cracking up and i still freaking laugh. its so funny. i wish there was a part where we can share our stories n submit them becuz i so wud. awsum app n evry1 who thinks its innappropriate...stop complainin n just dnt read it.
__label__0 I started to read it .  It. was horrible. I deleted it like 5 minutes later. It is not appropriate for kids. I would only recommend this app for adults. It shows bad pictures too.
__label__1 the sex stories are great.  for the people who say its bad it is really not bad. I like it
__label__1 to all thoose it is not suppose to be funny it is to make u chuckle but not to lyho (laugh your head off)  colon give it a break gosh
__label__0 Worst app ever! It did not make me laugh once, I deleted it right away. This app is not even worth downloading, seriously. Don't waste your time this app sucks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
__label__1 this is an awesome game but dont get it if u cant read it is just awsome it gets u in the mood
__label__1 I tree with awesome.....I'm 11 and I think this app is so funnnny!! Some are weird but the rest are just plain old funny.....I would recommend this to anyone who likes to laugh!!!!
__label__0 I really did love this app until they updated it and now it won't even load enough to do anything it just force closes it.They need to work out this bug fast .
__label__1 This is a great app to have to make you laugh , you should really get it some stories are inappropriate but great and funny this app is awsome.
__label__0 well ive just read the reveves and i don't want to download good luck getting any people to down load DONT WASTE YOUR TIME!

__label__1 this program is like a light version of Microsoft access.  I would pay for it if it allowed you to select a photo for the background.
__label__1 It's so great to have *vertical* customizable columns &amp; more! Am starting a new very small homs-based business... will use this for keeping inventory records and and so on (none of the inventory apps fit my needs). Will also use this for personal thi
__label__0 This game is the worst a slot machine game could get. I don't know why we had to pay for the game in the first place. I highly recommend that you DO NOT buy this game. Overall, it is a load of rubbish. If you want a good game, go ahead and start looking 
__label__1 Great easy to play game. Perfect to share with grandma! Hopefully it will help avoid trips to the casino lol
__label__1 Yes I love Teddy Bears &amp; slots, it's the best of both worlds! The pulsating hearts are a tad freaky. As for payouts, I bet conservatively one dollar a bet and after thirty minutes I had over thirty thousand dollars. Won over thirteen thousand in a ja
__label__1 I got this game because it reminded me of a machine at the casino, of course if I 'hit' as well as I do on this game in the casino I would be a very happy camper! The bonus rounds are really fun and the game plays great on my Kindle Fire. If you want som
__label__1 I really like this game but wish it had more different bonus levels. The super bear bonus was great just wish there were more different kinds instead of just the 2 -3 bonuses.
__label__1 This is the game for slot freaks. Hours of entertainment and you can really win some &quot;fake &quot; money too.  Has not frozen up on me so far. WARNING very very addictive. Does anyone have the phone number of MegaHearts Anonymous?
__label__0 I can't see any point to a gambling app that doesn't allow you to win any money. At the very least, players should have a chance to win back what they paid for the app! This is not really a &quot;game&quot; as there is no skill involved. Might as well ha
__label__1 I am playing this on my Kindle Fire and it is working perfectly!  Winning started off slow and I raised my bet to $500 per pull and started winning like crazy.  I hit 4 or 5 major bonus games in a row and I won $6,017,940 in about one hour.  I hit 4 or 5
__label__1 ........love it........fun.......the bear is a little creepy but since I down loaded it I have been winning up to 35,000,000.00 and the bounds games aren't bad neither..........but it really should have a button to makes the winnings go a lot faster so I
__label__0 This was such a lame game. Glad it was free. The payoff is so small if you get a payoff at all. I bet $20 and I still lost all my money! Glad it was free!!
__label__0 This has got to be one of the most boring slot games ever created! The price &quot;free &quot; is too much to spend! Don't waste time downloading this. Life is too short! ;0)
__label__0 even though it is the faotd it id notbl worth it. i.t froze the screen for 7 hours and then deleted everything!!!!)
__label__1 Fun free app of the day. Graphics are great. No thinking required. Reminds me of the slots in Biloxi. Enjoy!!!
__label__0 The graphics and sounds are okay I guess, but since there is no real money involved it is a very dull game.Even the "extra" games you can play when you win like roulette and and card colour guessing game don't help it.Don't waste your time on it, even th
__label__1 this app is not even on the top 100 free apps list for kindle fire so I am not even going to get it even though it is the faotd. that's all I am going to say.
__label__1 Choice of odds payout makes for lots of action! Dream odds highly recommened. Frequent bonuses and generous play at $100 bet. Over a million in winnings so far. Great fun!
__label__1 this is a fun slots game. you have a few fun options with it. you can watch your winnijngs counted or turn it off. i like it on myself. you can play 5 or 6 reels. my fav option is the payout option.  dream is the way to go. won 24 mil jusf playing around
__label__1 I hated slot games until I was attempting to get my Mom to purchase a Kindle Fire and allowed her to downloaded this app.  It's additive! The mini games are fun. as well. I play this app while watching TV because there's no thinking.
__label__1 Had placed several smart phones on the counter of my bar and customers were really into the slots until the ATf showed up. Arrested seven patrons, me, and closed down my joint. Thanks for nothing Mega Hearts Slots. Use with care.
__label__1 lovely game! nice graphics and good sounds. I won 85k on a $20 bet with dream winnings on. refreshing game :-)
__label__1 The best part about this is that it works flawlessly on my HTC Inspire and my 10inch tablet.  no ads and no problems of any kind.  I could pass and hour a day if I had the time..  I love Mega hearts. the maker of this app did a GREAT JOB with this game. 
__label__1 I don't understand why this game isn't being rated better. My husband and I are having a blast with it.payout is great so that makes it even more fun. I haveplayed a lot of these games and they start out fun thenyou can't win enough to keep you into them
__label__1 I really enjoy playing this slot game.  It is like I am in Las Vegas without losing any real money.
__label__1 I enjoy playing this game.  It has great graphics, spins like a REAL slot machine, and is very entertaining!  Not sorry I purchased this one!
__label__0 As a recovered gambling addict, I was really disappointed to see that Amazon would taunt my uncontrollable urge, then I saw that you can win the &quot;Chocopot&quot;! I haven't addressed my eating disorder yet so I felt this was perfect! So I go for a wa
__label__1 this is a great slot game. bonus games comes often, payouts are great, too bad the casinos don't pay this way.  I recommend this to all that enjoy playing slots.
__label__0 Started playing, and CRASH! Restarted, and found the game play awkward. The quizzes look fun,  and I want to play, but it doesn&apos;t work well on my Droid 2.
__label__1 use it on the computer all the time. just wish you could challenge friends too like online. very fun though. Hopefully they add the challenge option soon.
__label__0 What a junk application. Not fun, set up is idiotic. Typing is buggy. Glad it was free. Not worth buying. Maybe after some updates...
__label__0 This might be a good app but I wouldn&apos;t know since it never opened just force closed every time I tried to use it. I appreciate Amazon free Apps but Sporcle is useless on my Droidx.
__label__1 This was the first app i bought from Android Market in March when i got my phone. I love it and use it daily. It keeps me thinking and keeps my mind working.The quizzes are timed, so you have to be quick! However, you aren't forced to answer them in orde
__label__0 I tried to download this on my kindle, and it charged me for it but wont let me install it.
__label__0 I love the Sporcle website. I play all the time and find it well-implemented, clever, and entertaining. I like it so much I paid for this, which was a mistake. This app is none of those things.Every game I've found so far requires that you type in the an
__label__0 That says it all. Just add it to anything related to this app. Example: UI...Stupid, Categories... Stupid, The Quizzes... you guessed it.
__label__1 I really like the sporcle web site, this is pretty close. It&apos;s really fun and has a lot of great quizzes. I do wish it would recognize wrong spelling. As for those complaining about not being able to type fast, that has nothing to do with the gamepl
__label__0 lately the free Apps haven&apos;t interested me but I like random trivia. so I download it, clicked to install, and all it says is &quot;not installed&quot; with no reason why. don&apos;t know if it&apos;s my phone or what but I can&apos;t rate properly 
__label__1 Works great on Droid X. Almost an infinite amount of quizzes. Definitely going to be usable for a while, and that&apos;s all I want out of an app.
__label__0 At first I thought this wasn't bad. I knew all this answers and other than problems with speed typing and errors I gave it 3 stars.  Then I got into a couple of games.  You really can't skip an answer!  What a piece of junk! Uninstall...
__label__0 I love trivia, but this is stupid. I just want trivia in categories that I recognize, not NHL captains. WTF? I love hockey, but that is too trivial. Uninstalled. Go away, sporkle.
__label__0 I only see a black screen aww boo.  I really wanted to try it.  samsung transform  thats the prob with so many slight  ver. of android hardware
__label__1 This App made it very easy to calculate car payments when car shopping. Was very useful for me eliminated all the guess work.Barbara S.
__label__1 I especially appreciated the ability to input taxes, trade-ins, etc. Pretty much covers all possible permutations of the car buying/pricing process.
__label__1 this app allows you to determine monthly payment from purchase price, expected fuel costs, and what car you could afford based on monthly payment.  light app and easy to use!!
__label__1 This app is a very handy tool  Kindle tool. I've used it several times in car dealerships to double-check their auto loan calculations.

__label__1 This is a very useful app for car shopping.  It works well on the kindle with very good result.  Recommend.
__label__1 I've used this apps couple of times, trying to help my friends out for the interest rate or even the amount of downpayment to give the dealer. So it has been helpful at times, it is nothing that you use EVERYDAY, overstatIng when you need it you will be

__label__1 As a student of the Bible, it is so cool having Strong Concordance's references at your fingertips, as well as other bible translations, books, commentaries. maps, and dictionaries that you can download as part of the app and have at your fingertips, too
__label__1 I've had these on my old pocket pc's and found very useful. Some nice commentary downloads from Calvin to Henry to Keil and Delitzch, Luther. A very expensive library easily downloaded for nothing. Nice maps dictionaries, books. An excellent product that

__label__1 well its okay but when i played it for my kid at night he had nightmares because the voice scared him and i don't blame him at all. plus it was hard to hear on the kindle fire. so other than that it was fine.
__label__0 The app did not work was not happy about it so my commen is not a good one about this product
__label__0 I chose this app because it has the opportunity to compare different versions of the bible, side by side, offline. Most of the features shown in the preview wasn't their after download. I'm not sure if they weren't downloaded, was not intended in the fre
__label__1 THIS APP IS GREAT FOR BIBLE STUDY AND YOU CAN EVEN GET ACCESS TO MORE INFO ONLINE. WORKS GREAT OFF LINE. WOULD RECCOMEND.
__label__1 This app is a drill sergeant!! LOLIt does not play around when it comes to your workout. Best trainer I have downloaded...love the gps and the fact that it is very, very accurate.
__label__0 The map feature comes up with your route with no map behind it, just a red line of your route. I find Map My Ride to be a far superior product.
__label__1 I am walking for my health. The Runkeeper helps me keep track of the progress I make each day.  I compare the results of each day with the previous ones.
__label__1 this helps get me motivated to get up and walk and it makes me feel like I actually accomplished something when I get done to look at the results and the path I walked.  they have a setting for walking, running or bicycling. gives calories burned, voiced
__label__1 I enjoy this program, and have it on both Kindle and smartphone.  Easy to keep track of my daily activity, helps map out walking/running courses, and encourages me to stay the course.  I recommend it!
__label__1 A great tool to keep your apps organized. Easy to find your way around and use. I use it a lot.
__label__1 I use my ViewSonic gTablet to display Sunday Church programs and meeting schedules that change each week.  My SD card was filling up with outdated programs which with my limited skills I found onerous to delete.  This little program has made the process 
__label__1 this is the perfect app for anyone who needs to manage data on their kindle fire without the aid of a Pc. excellent for getting rid of accidental downloads and duplicate files.
__label__0 its so stupid ok. yeah I don't really care for the reviews but this app is so. I cant even explain the pics on the cracked screen don't even looked like its cracked its dumb. I tryied to remove the app from my kindle it wont waste of space don't buy
__label__0 I got this one as a simple time waster.  but it really is nothing with using.  I get is free, but even basic broken screen prank apps will break where you touch, this one only has a single image per break type I'll pass and get a better one, still free..
__label__0 it sucks and i uninstalled after trying all the diffrent screens, in other word three seconds latertwo thumbs down
__label__0 Not very funny.  And no, I was not convinced that my brand-new kindle was broken.  It is just a stupid prank.
__label__0 The graphics are very, very, very bad. The only way to turn it off is to completely shut down your device (Kindle Fire).
__label__0 I thought u would actually open the app it doesn't hide status bar had to go into to apps menu to delete it. everytime u tryed to delete it from main menu all it would do is crack not convincing either
__label__0 i  put it on my kindle fire and it stayed and i had to turn it off i wish i could rate it lower
__label__0 trust me to NOT GET this app it froze my kindle fire and it doesn't even do what it says
__label__1 Great gag app, I use it all the time. It is good for snoopy people that look over your shoulder.
__label__0 u don't even need this app if u want your screen to crack just.throw it on the ground then there u.go a broken screen
__label__1 I tried this app on my mom and she was SO mad at me for 'breaking' my new kindle fire. And it was hilarious!!! I would definitely recommend this app to anyone. It looks so real and it will fool anyone. I love it!!!
__label__0 i got the app then i pranked some people in my family then whenever i launched the app i quit it then whenever i touched something it would launch the app wtf!!! you should change that do not get i deleted it
__label__0 plz. don't get this app. everyone can tell thy its fake... don't buy this its a waste of app.space. It kept crashing when I opened it... very lame, and not good.
__label__0 this is a waste of rime its crappy graphics if u delete it the screen keeps cracking.it looks bad Abe it suck
__label__1 This app does exactly what it says. You will npt trick the police or your carrier with this app. But you can scare your wife or kids
__label__0 I got this app for. my kindle fire every time you touch the screen it cracks it has awful grahpics to don't get its awfull
__label__1 works on kindle fire. love that my friends don't believe me until I make them touch the screen halarious on young boys and girls. cool
__label__0 n o t.  w o r t h. I t.  n o p e.  n o p e.  s o j u s s. k e e p.  g o n .
__label__0 First of all, this app is just a copy of Crack Your Screen. Second of all, it looks like a CRAPPY copy of Crack Your Screen. Just get Crack Your Screen, people. That's what I have.
__label__1 I luv this app because my mom thought I broke my screen and almost bought me a new onesincerely,Carlie Kitner
__label__1 this is awesome u can prank peaple into thinking your screen is broken if u do not prank ok its just me thinking.
__label__0 Three taps and the screen goes back to normal. Thats no fun. The app does what it says its supposed to but it should stay to appear broken unless you go in the menu and exit the app or something.
__label__0 this app is a waste of time.it does not look like it broke. it does nothing like my hermit crabs
__label__0 you can tell the graphics on the screen is fake. I kept on trying this app on people but everybody could tell it was fake. crack your screen is much better. get crack your screen its not a rip off.
__label__0 graphics suck and its totally useless.  uninstalled after about a minute. I'm actually upset that i cant remove it from my download history.
__label__0 don't get this app!!! it started freaking me out beacause it kept on cracking the screen. but then I figured out that u have to turn your kindle fire off, then turn it back on, then delete it.
__label__0 Hey Hey Trojan: I'm going to pop a hole your logic. what if touring have that kind of screen saverAnywho..tell me if you downloaded this app and kept it for more than a week and be truthful...the app gets old after a while unless you have a lot of friend
__label__1 I fooled my mom with it! She was going bonkers! I can't wait to try it on my dad! She was about to freak out and go really nutty! It is super funny!
__label__0 please do not waste your time on downloading this app it was poorly put together my lil brother can make a better app and its so unrealistic 1 star was I could give it a 0
__label__0 This app is terrible! It almost kept my screen on the static option, permanently. If you want your screen to look like a wild pack of buffalo stomped the poop out of it, be my guest. Because of my experience I would not recommend this app.
__label__0 This app is the worst app ever!!! It took a half hour just to get it half way downloaded!! So I advise u DO NOT I REAPEAT DO NOT GET THIS APP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
__label__0 This thing doesn't even look like my screen is cracked!! My friend tried this on her little brother and he even told her that it was fake!!! He even knew that it was an app!! DUMB!!!
__label__0 I got it and ones you have had it for a day evevery time you click some thing then it's cracked up every time its stupid don't buy it
__label__0 it was good until I didn't press it and it keep comingback on my screen I got mad but if u want that piece of junk then go ahead
__label__0 this app is really cool to trick people but i couldn't change the setting so i didn't really like it.
__label__1 I enjoyed drop it on pillows and picking it up and trying to make other people feel guilty. tricked my annoying nieghbor.  its free free free free
__label__0 When you turn the broken screen on, the app automatically gives you a frozen broken screen with no option to turn it off or to get it out of the way to do other things on the kindle. Had to delete it to make it stop. Thumbs down on this app!
__label__0 sometimes I accadentley click on it and it happens all thetime and I hate it. it is so annoying
__label__0 RIGHT WHEN I DOWNLOADED IT ANYTIME I TOUCHED MY SCREEN IT BROKE I WAS LIKE WHAT THE HELL I DELETED IT BUT IT WONT STOP CRACKIN AND IT GOT STUCK LIKE THAT FOR TWO DAYS!!!! WASTED MY TIME!!!  :[
__label__0 doesn't look real I do not like broken screen prank I hate it is a horrible app dont get it
__label__1 I fool all my friends and family with this prank!My dad got SO scared when he saw it but then he relized.I really got him.Its pretty cool.
__label__1 I did this to my dad and I got this from him on Christmas and he screamed, "WHAT?! YOU BROKE IT?! AFTER ALL THE MONEY I SPEND ON THAT?!" I was like Take an aspirin dude! After that I showed him the app while I Lmfao!Then on the bus I showed it to my frie
__label__1 1. how do you get rid of it of your screen2. AWSOMEI pranked my grandma she said wtf how did you break it already God bless a milk cow
__label__1 I luhz it if u don't then read the description. it does exactly what it says it does! Literally stop looking drop into it!
__label__1 I love this app it works great on my Kindle Fire,it does not crash,and it gets a good laugh out of me and my friends.
__label__0 I can't see how ANYBODY looked at these graphics and thought, &quot;Yeah, that totally looks like a broken PHONE screen&quot;, television screen. MAYBE, if it's my dead grandparent's black and white Zenith that they got rid of almost 30 years ago. Can't 
__label__0 The image looks fake and it seems the banner has to be disabled every time you use it. Don't waste any effort or time on this application
__label__0 I'm sorry, but this is a pointless app, good try thought, I can give you that. I would like to give a higher rating, but It's just not there
__label__0 Like i downloaded it and then i had to shut down my kindle and turn it back on so i could take it off because i couldn't click anything else without it popping up.
__label__0 I hate it I would be sliding through the games on my kindle fire I wouldn't press it it would come on it would take me a littel while to get it off I hate it hate it hate it
__label__1 Ha I can fitly prank my mom dad and grandma wow this will be helarias your talking about the oltoment
__label__0 It is the worst prank app ever in the history of apps. Just terrible!!!!!!!!!!!!It is a waste of storage use.
__label__1 its awesome I even tricked my grandpa. and my mom and my grandma its awesome and its ffffrrreee.  its bomb! coolness
__label__0 I excpected it to be actually realistic and cool but you can see everything behind the &quot;crack&quot; and when I tried to delete it all it did was keep going back on and I got so frustrated. I dont recommend this application but its your opinion
__label__0 this app is terrible. i could not uninstall it so i asked my mom for help and it took her an hour to get it off.STINCKS STINKS STINKS STINKS STINKS STINKS STINKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
__label__0 needs a lot of work and it is a horrible game I hats it its the worst game ever and I mean ever I would say to get reg of it it is terrible
__label__0 This is not good at all it only has one screen crack and it don't even let u go anywhere else like u have a real broken screen and can go play a game or something . And u can't change to a different screen crack.
__label__1 It's FREE... if you don't like it,  don't use it!  people need to stop being such haters. Be kind to others.
__label__1 I love this app I can prank my friends when they come over.  it is sooooooo fun 2 play with and a good waste of time!
__label__1 I myself have never played with this game.  My grand daughter uses this and she states she loves it.  So I believe it's good or she wouldn't use it.
__label__0 hey dev.. keep trying..glass break sound loops non stop on dx running gb. couldn't kill sound so uninstalled. that locked the phone up with sound still looping. had to do a battery pull.
__label__0 I got this app thinking it would be kinds cool to have. a cracked looking screen. It too me five days to fix this.. but whenever I tapped on anything on my screen to do ANYTHING... it wouldn't let me because then the screen would then crack... and wouldn
__label__0 This app will not fool anyone. It uses unrealistic sound and keeps the status bar available on the top.This is just a gimmick to use on old folks who have no functional knowledge of cell phones.
__label__0 I was trying it out when after it closed it kept on going. so I had to shut down my kindle fire if u like geting annoed sorry I'm ten. do not get it
__label__1 I love it I am going to prank my sister. I love this app I think tu shouuld by this app
__label__0 It is not fun. It is fun for maybe, what, five seconds? You just touch your screen to ' crack ' it and that is it.
__label__1 My mom fell for it and bought me a new one so hilarious I love this app very very fun
__label__0 this app is sooooooo stupid it crashes. plus the cracked screen would not even fool you if you had thirty beers I'm worning you don't get this app
__label__1 I fooled my mom, friend, and sister with this app! its great for leaving your device out in public. so people wont want to steal it if its &quot;broken&quot; amazing app!!! &lt;3
__label__1 I really prank my friends and cool......best app ever...........is cool :-) wow and cool app I will rate 5 stars
__label__1 Can't wait to use it on my parents y y y y y y y y y y y y y y y h y h th g BBC y h
__label__0 ... Is accurate in saying this app is a joke. I'll just say that you get what you pay for... And this app is free.
__label__0 Wat first I thought it was cool but after using for a couple minuets it started to make my kindle fire freeze and it wouldn't work I finally deleted it. plz don't get this app
__label__0 I HATE this app! I tried it on my KINDLE FIRE and it took me A LONG TIME to REMOVE it. See this is what it does You CRACK it and then you CANT see ANYTHING on the screen and it takes you FOREVER to take it OFF! I RECOMMEND you DONT get this app!
__label__0 boring but a little fun but good for a prank but after a while it will start to suck little.
__label__1 It tricked my sisters and she said ow so she told my mom and she grounded me f or a week I told her it was fake
__label__0 Not for the LG optimus, does not install at all. I was excited about this app and did look forward to logging into kongregate, its a great community, but sadly will not work on my phone. Also does not work without flash and there is already a free versio
__label__1 If you're familiar with Kongregate, then you know what this is all about. If you're not familiar with kongregate, then go spend a few minutes on their website. Now imagine playing those games on your phone. Not ALL games will please everyone, but with th
__label__0 this is 5 dollars wasted. on the kongregate website you can download the exact same app for free. merely slapping a &quot;pro&quot; in the name does not make it worth the ridiculous 5 dollar price tag
__label__1 It is easy and basic but can be challenging. It passes the time okay. I have played it many times and still like it. It takes some strategy but isn't so hard you give up.
__label__1 Don&apos;t know why Even put one star, this is a great game, fun give it a chance, hell it&apos;s free what can you loose
__label__0 That's right. I started the game today and it said I had to log into the Amazon App Store to play it.Not acceptable. Uninstalled.
__label__1 It took a few games to figure out what to do, but ever since then it has been a blast. I got it as the FAOTD and couldn't be happier. This is definitely an app worth paying for.This is a strategy game that is fun and keeps your attention (especially if y
__label__0 HTC Desire, the dice don&apos;t roll so I have no way of knowing if the app is worthy of a download. As it stands, if they fix the problem I&apos;ll fix the rating.
__label__1 I decided to pick this up as the Free App of the Day in spite of some of the poor and uninformative reviews and I&apos;m glad I didn&apos;t miss out on this great game.\nDo yourself a favor and watch the video! It is well done and explains the strategy i
__label__1 I loved this game when it used to only be on iPhone, I always had to use my girlfriends phone to play. Then I found the free version on the android market and now the paid version is free on here, its pretty addicting.
__label__0 ...until today's update, which included an insane list of new,  extremely intrusive permissions. You suck, Canned Bananas. You already had in app purchases included &amp; now this? Uninstalled.
__label__1 I downloaded this game when it was the free app of the day.  Not being a big fan of matching games, I was pretty sure this game would get uninstalled rather quickly.  Several weeks later, I can say that Lock N Roll is still getting quite a bit of play on
__label__1 I got hooked really quickly. The tutorial is really short, but there&apos;s additional info\/instruction available in the menu. Fun little game, probably going to have to limit myself on when and where I can play it. While laying in bed at night is defin
__label__0 Evo 4g dice do not roll. Can&apos;t play if dice don&apos;t move. If this is fixed I&apos;ll try again and update review.
__label__0 1 star because the app was fun until it started force closing on me and trying to donkey punch my phone.
__label__1 Fun game but once you learn the trick of clearing the board it gets a little to easy and ends up boring around 150k you just want it to end
__label__1 Fun and challenging app. Not much to it but is quick to play and challenges you to beat previous scores with various ways to score and remove dice.
__label__1 This is really a fun little app for when you are waiting for a meal or in a doctor&apos;s office. I really like it.
__label__0 Would not even open on my other tablet.10.1" dual core @ 1.6icecream A 4.0Could be one of the best thing in apps, but, sadly, is not at allUPDATE to the above: They had an update, that made it work, for Tablet, but sadly, ONLY on the tablet. Kind of defe
__label__0 I am interested in the idea of sending pictures to my TV from a tablet.  I downloaded this and it was easy to install but it would not recognize my TV that I uses Wi-Fi to down load Prime  and Netflix movies and TV shows.  Maybe the TV is too old.  I bou
__label__1 Does what it says it does. If you want to toss up your movies and such through apple tv this is for you then
__label__1 Great idea, all You need is internet connection,....a lot of great movies and other shows, educational etc., I love it
__label__0 I have a Kindle Fire HD.  This app simply does not work with my Kindle.  Given it's popularity, I assume this product likely works best on Android phones which I'll try shortly, but my HTC One already has DLNA interface functionality built in.  For me pe
__label__1 cant believe i can watch anything on my tv that i can watch on my kindle....love this app and recommend it to everyone......
__label__1 This is the best app by far! I can say that it is very cool to send the videos your watching to your own smart TV. And easy!
__label__1 This app works on my Sony Smart DVD player and also works on my Xbox 360. Loaded with videos. I plan on buying the pro version.
__label__1 Hangman games are the best especially when you put your mind to the task. Fourteen categories are presented. "All" is usually my choice to save the man from his demise. if you let the simple design fool you another fatality is your surprise.
__label__0 never used, could never get it to do whatever it was supposed to do.  I guess I just didn't have the patience to learn how to play the game. removed it from my tablet.
__label__0 stupid dumb app this is. don't download it. no wounder its free.glow hangman is stupid four words don't download it'sstupid.
__label__0 Way to small on Kindle Fire can barley even see it and letters are so small you hit the wrong letters. Free app but not worth the download
__label__1 I love this app. Not only do I use it in the park,  I also like to browse through the lounge and look at the beautiful pics people take during their day. I hold a passport but I don't get there as often as I'd like. I 've never posted because I'm just no
__label__1 Very helpful when you are a visitor to Disneyland and trying to plan your day.  Comes in really handy if you have young children who do not do well in long lines.
__label__1 This is such a great app!  Thanks!  I can't wait to use on my upcoming trip to Disneyland and California Adventure.
__label__0 The members of this social club are beyond rude! I felt like I was in high school once again, very snobby!
__label__1 I always use this app and I love it!!! Always accurate and always keeping me updated with what's going on. I love how CMS are on here adding anything they know :)
__label__0 This could be a good app but when I always try to log in it forsecloses. fix it please and I will rate it better
__label__1 This was just what I was looking for to help keep track of the family budget.  It is easy to use and does not require an account on another website like some other budgeting apps.
__label__1 This app is a lot of fun. It taught me where our money goes.Then at the end of the month, I can adjust my spending.
__label__0 I was really looking forward to using this app. I have a kindle fire and it would not download at all. So dissappointed. I'm glad it was free but I still wanted to use it. If it would download I would have probably loved it. Oh well. Thanks
__label__0 Some of the reviews were good for this so I gave it a try since it was free. I found it to be a very confusing app and found it wasn't at all what I thought it would be. Don't waist your time on this app.
__label__1 I love this app. It's easy to use and I like how I can add all my accounts and credit cards as well as all the most common vendors I use. It gives an analysis of how much I'm spending and where. I keep track of all my bill payments on it too! Works great
__label__0 why do they need to know your exact GPS location and why does the frog randomly die? Why dont they have people test the games and apps before making people pay for them?
__label__1 I played a fair amount of Frogger on my Timex-Sinclair 1024 as a kid.  This is just as much fun, and with much better graphics.
__label__1 Sound and video runs fine. Controls are OK once you get used to it just like other games. No errors or anything like other people. Overall perfectly good game for 99 cents
__label__1 This is a fun application if you can get across. Just have to do more practice.Great grandson loves it and never gets across.
__label__0 It seems this game was designed for a specific screen resolution, and doesn't adjust for different devices. Screen elements are placed in very awkward positions. This is a very low quality production. Expect more from such a major player in gaming.
__label__0 I downloaded this game on my Kindle Fire and I was able to open it but all it did was play music which was very irritating.  I couldn't play the game at all.  I called Amazon and they credited my account and I uninstalled it from my fire....waste of time
__label__0 Won't install, so have no idea if its any good. Amazon sent me email like I got it but it throws error that it can't install. Droid2 global
__label__1 Classic frogger, cuter than ever.It does request gps location like the other fient scoring Apps I have, and it is frogger, so it will only work in portrait mode, neither of which is a suprise to anyone who has used fient or who has played frogger.Gamepla
__label__0 I wish I could at least try this game, but when I attempted to open it on my Droid Pro, it said "Must be played in portrait mode. Can't be played in landscape mode".  I turned the auto rotate off on my phone and it still wouldn't open. Amazon's suggestio
__label__0 Sucky gameplay and controls. Laggy response. Sucky graphics and music. Sucky permissions. For a game that doesn't connect to the internet, there's no need for GPS or the ability to discover your accounts.
__label__0 I can't think of a possible reason for Frogger to need my location or the ability to discover my accounts... and apparently neither can the developer because they offer no explanation.  I won't install this program until both of those permissions are rem
__label__1 I didn't have an issue with lagging on my HTC Incredible.  Just like I remember playing as a kid.  Is still challenging (or maybe it's just me, lol)  Love Frogger and am so glad it's a FAOTD.  Would definitely pay .99 cents for it :)
__label__0 Not fun.  Music Is so annoying and does not stop when you exit.  Do not bother with this one.  Uninstalled.
__label__0 It downloaded and opened successfully on my Archos 43 Tablet.  The music plays and the clouds roll by on the main menu page like it's working, but nothing happens when I try to play a game or view options.  Got the same results when I tried to "test driv
__label__1 Works perfect on the Inspire 4G with AT&amp;T Gingerbread update. Fun game, worth $.99 easy, even better free. Get it while it lasts.
__label__1 This is a fun game. A little reminder of where hundreds (maybe thousands) of quarters went. I'll have to be careful that I don't pull a George Castanza if I'm playing this while walking down the street.
__label__1 I read all of the reviews before downloading and still did.  Bad reviews due to operator error seem to be very popular with faotds and it's very unfair to the developers.I have been very satisfied with any Feint game I've downloaded and this is no except
__label__1 they finally came out with this game I'm soo happy because when I was little I had a gameboy and hade it but I lost it and I was on the last level to
__label__0 Why does amazon developers not explain the permissions they request? GPS and find all my accounts for frogger? Be nice to have am explanation for the request and if needed that  is fine.
__label__1 this game takes me back. nicely done. and it actually works on my p.o.s. temp replacement phone (htc hero) had samsung moment it got wet and broke. saving,for evo. anyways ty dev for making something us p.o.s. phone users can use.
__label__1 i was shocked to see that this game is exactly like the game i use to play at the arcade 27 to 30 years ago. its fun and its challenging. i recommend it to those who like a challenge.
__label__0 The screen is sooooo tiny! Too hard to play. Find a different version elsewhere if you want to play this game.
__label__1 Awesome port of retro arcade throwback to 80's era. It was a time of david bowie, big hair bands and one hit wonders. A time of mtv and arcade houses. Home based arcades and computers were lacking so the only place to play cutting edge videogames were th
__label__1 to play this as a young child so it was nice to know it is back for my kindle fire, i spend hours on this and enjoy my youth all over again.
__label__0 it's not a good omen when you have to tap the screen several times just to start the game, as nothings happening after the first tap. it only got worse - could not manoeuvre the frog at all. rarely do I rate an app 1 star, but this game fully deserves it
__label__1 Nice port of Frogger. Graphics are decent, controls are good (how else do you expect to play a touchscreen game if not by TOUCHING the screen and as a result, cover up some of the screen), and the game is not slow as some people have stated (even on my o
__label__0 this game is so horrible the controls are bad and its so slow who ever made this game was a waste of time this app id a piece of garbage
__label__1 this game is the best frog you could ever bye!!! totally worth 0.99 cents!!! if you have the money I definetly reccomend this game for you!!!:) :) :)
__label__1 I loved this game since I first had it on my laptop - I have been trying to get past the first level and it is hard - it is harder to play on the kindle but I still love it - second level here I come
__label__1 why people never happy with the free app of the day???? cmon people its free .if you don't like it don't download it.
__label__1 This is a good game and fun trying to keep the frogs from getting smashed and to get to the other side. You got to get it now!
__label__1 This game brings back memories of the original game, with a kick! I could sit and play for hours, if I had the time!
__label__0 I was happy to see this classic as the free app, but even for a free app this sucks. The controls are bad, the game is slow, runs only in the portrait mode and add to that it malfunctions - even after I exited the game the background music kept going on 
__label__0 Really?  Why would a game like Frogger need my FINE location data?  Is the game going to use this information to simulate frogs running across MY street from my home to my neighbors!  I don't think so.  Unacceptable invasion of privacy!
__label__0 I should have listened to the reviews. The controls are to slow. You get killed every time. If you're bored it might be ok.
__label__0 Sorry folks, no game should need the &quot;discover known accounts&quot; permission. Fine targeted advertising (using my GPS and draining my battery) is bad enough. Swiping my email addresses, Facebook ID and Twitter ID so you can spam me without telling
__label__1 Runs great on galaxy tab.  Fun and levels get hard enough for me.controls are ok. Just like old times, just nt as expensive
__label__0 what a steaming pile.  forget about the permissions, this game just doesnt have the feel and fun of the original.
__label__0 Good god... the music gets stuck in a loop and makes me want to scream.  had to force kill it.  not good.  sorry dev... Uninstalled to spare what is left of my sanity.  DroidX.
__label__1 Frogger is so much fun. My mom loves playing it, too, as she relives her atari days. Definitely recommend purchasing this game.
__label__0 I can be sitting on a log and just die, the screen doesn't fill my while screen...... what else can I say, this game is pretty bad, not the worst, but not worth a dollar, stay away unless its free.
__label__0 The game was great 20 years ago, but it needs an update to be good today. The controls were poor.
__label__0 Very sluggish controls, frequent crashes and poorly executed. Bad game on all fronts, cant hold a candle to the original.
__label__1 you can get by cars and I can travel on wood second level third level way better than first this app is the third best app I have and f.y.I. I have fifty-six
__label__1 The original frogger game, on the Atari, (yes I said Atari), was my absolute favorite. This is pretty close, all I need is a joystic. I've had no hiccups, freezes or problems with the running of it.
__label__1 if it crashes on your phone then thats not the dev fault, get a better phone or better build of android. i had the free version installed. needless to say its better without the ads and worth a buck if you like the classic arcade game. anyone expecting a
__label__1 This is a really fun app me and my friends play it all the time at school really fun awesome fun
__label__1 I'm surprised to see this in the app store. Just to let you know, people who are I their forties played this game as a kid. Yeah, it's THAT old. But it's pretty fun, so it wasn't a complete waste.
__label__0 I found this very confusing.  Also, it seemed to require buying weapons to use. I wasn't sure so I deleted it from my Kindle Fire.
__label__1 i also like this game. cause it is from the original atari. its just like what i grew up with. its fun.
__label__0 I think Amazon should make sure that the games they let on the Kindle-Fire works this game I have never been able to play I clicked on new game nothing happen so I have bought this game for nothing.
__label__0 As a kid of the 80's I got really excited when I saw this available. But it is horrible to play. The controls are difficult and the darn frog would die for no reason now and then. I gave up and uninstalled in frustration. AVOID!
__label__1 I love this game.I had it on the original Atari and also on X box.This app is just like the old  game and is easy to play.I would recommend it to everyone!
__label__1 Not like the old Atari game, but still entertaining. Of course the graphics are 10x better, but if you are going for old school this is different.
__label__0 Completely unable to play this game as it force closes each time I start it. Sometimes I get as far as starting a new game, but usually I don't get as far as the main menu. Motorola Droid 2 rooted
__label__0 music seemed to get stuck. slide control seemed to work okay, tap did not work at all. music stayed on after quick close, no other way to exit. oh and yes the dumb permissions.
__label__1 Get it. It will consume you! Games are quick and challenging. They are great to pass a few minutes or hours.
__label__1 I have played this game for ever.....it's fun fun fun......play it it's hard but you learn  to get  along I love happy happy...
__label__1 I've read all of the reviews &amp; decided to try it out anyway. Yes it's not exactly THE original frogger. So? This application works just fine on the Incredible running 2.2. Game play was just fine. Very smooth. Someone complained about their thumb cov
__label__0 controls  suck they work then the don't thought it might be my phones touch screen (HTC EVO 4G) but its the game. the music is not the right frogger music. so glad I didn't pay for this game. waste of time to even down load..... for those of u talking ab
__label__1 It reminds me of the old frogger game from years ago. Very challenging and loads of fun for everyone to enjoy.
__label__0 My husband really likes this game.  It can be challenging and he likes to be able to get farther against other opponents.
__label__1 One of my favorite games on my HTC sensation. no problems with lag at all. great classic look. love it! don't listen to all the whiners who complain about graphics. this isn't halo for gods sake. its a basic and fun arcade game!!
__label__1 First of all, to all of the 1 star ratings who are whining about "unexplained deaths"...The reason that you are dying is because each frog has a time limit to get across the road,so if you don't want to die, then pay attention and learn to play before yo
__label__1 Love this app.  It's just like playing the original, but with phone controls.  The graphics make it a classic instead of trying to improve something that already has fans in its original state.  Also, for the complainers that say they keep dieing, perhap
__label__1 yeah, I am not seeing any other difficulties others are complaining about. It took me a sec to figure out I had to swipe to move to us otherwise it is easy to use. Good simple game, probably a 4 star game but I gave it 5 to offset the asshats around here
__label__0 I love the idea of playing frogger again! Unfortunately, this app has a bad bug. every time I play this game and annoying song keeps playing over and over and over and won't stop even when I close out of the game. I have to shut my phone off everytime ju
__label__0 Very abusive permissions for a game. I can understand access to your SD card to save data, but why does it need to access your GPS or phone state or list of account names? I'm not going to install this one until they fix the permission requirements.
__label__1 Got this game for my great nephew on my Kindle Fire.  His Dad had teach him how play because I had never played the game.  Now I play it when I have little time.
__label__1 I loved playing this game on atari game system in the 80s and this one is much better then that one
__label__0 Unlike the other games you purchase for your kindle which fit the entire screen to play, this game only fills up the screen about the size of a iphone which makes it even harder to play as the screen is very small. Plus its not as much fun as when we wer
__label__1 This is one of my all time favorite childhood game. Now I can rekindle that feeling of being a kid again. Getting that frog to the other side is sometimes hard, but fun. I think anyone at any age would enjoy this.
__label__1 just like the old days sometimes its harder cause its touchy to play, but my friends are getting this one also
__label__0 unneeded security permissions. No paid game app that is local play only needes GPS access. internet is for the lousy crapware of Feint. recommend avoiding due to GPS alone.
__label__1 I chose this rating because this game keeps me entertained & is very colorful. I also like the idea that this game is on the Kindle Tablet. & that I can take it with me wherever I go. There is nothing that I dislike about this game & I would highly recom
__label__1 Old favorite of mine.  I enjoy using it and it brings back memories of the old days.  Thanks for the fun.
__label__1 The game works great on my Thunderbolt! No issues at all. These other jokers either need a new phone with a bigger screen or are just simpletons. They certainly are not members of Mensa.
__label__1 HTC Inspire 4G phone and this works great. Takes me back to my youth playing the game and now the next generation can be play. Graphics are just as primitive as they were back in the 80's but that's perfectly fine and adds to the experience by enhancing 
__label__1 this game is just as i remember it in the arcades!! if i can recalls the the controls were crapy back then in the break danceN era so stop winning
__label__0 Couldn't control the frog with my Kindle Fire.  The timing is off.  There is lag time between my direction and the frog's movement.
__label__1 I was pleased to see this game is like the same as the old Atarigames were. I would like to see more of the old games come back
__label__1 Just as much fun as other games that I played in the past.  Fast and mind boggling.  A good game to try.
__label__0 this game is just not good I love the classic and though this game tryst to be that it is not the controls are just bad and this game has sooooooo much lag just don't buy this crap becomes games like this should not exist
__label__0 The description said it was from 1980! That's the 20th century.How would anyone still like that game now days? I mean, seriously this old stuff will not sell that well these days!!!!!!
__label__0 Sure, I'll be that guy today. Why does Frogger need my location? Not trying out of spite. Word word and 20 more words.
__label__0 this version of frogger is awful! they buttons to.move the frog are terrible, which makes it very diffiicult to play. you also cant slide right  behind a car because it will kill you! don't waste the $1 on this game, waste it on something else!
__label__0 Starts playing repetitive sound, must reboot phone to stop. Glad it was free. More words words words. Nothing like real thing.
__label__0 was excited to play frogger- downloaded and installed just fine. When I opened the game it said to switch to portrait mode.  I WAS in portrait mode!  very disappointed.Droid pro 610
__label__1 Have only played a little as yet, but it seems to work as good as the ones I remembered. Looking forward to paying it more.
__label__0 I looked foward to playing this game. But it never came on on my kindle fire. Save your money, avoid this app.
__label__1 I love playing some of the old games from the 80's and early 90's.  I downloaded Frogger on my Wii as well.  Neither is an exact replica of the original, but both are still pretty good.Would like to see an exact remake someday.
__label__0 Good game, like the original, but what the company does NOT tell you, i it is all on-line! Frogger online!? Never been heard of! Wish it WAS offline playable, but it isn't!
__label__1 OMG! Just hopping away with it. Still recent from buying this game, and anxious to get ALL of them into their caves. Well, looks like caves to me. Don't turn your head on this game. Well worth the stars!
__label__0 After updating to Jellybean 10.3 from Samsung on my Galaxy S3 a small menu screen would come up but despite repeated key-presses nothing would happen.
__label__0 I wanted to stop playing because of the painful music, but after I exited and was back on my home screen the same stupid song kept playing.  Fixed that with an uninstall.
__label__1 classic, nuff said! If you don't like Frogger, stay away from this game auuuuughhhhh! For those of you who love the classics, ENJOY YOUR BUTTS OFF!!! Peace!!!
__label__1 I don't understand negative reviews. The controls work fine with no lag. Some people complained that their frog would die for no reason...thats because there is a time limit.
__label__0 Seriously, I would have expected better from such a major publisher. This game was designed around the original android handsets. Force closes constantly. And when it does &#34;work&#34; (and I use that term lightly), the game is essentially unplayable. 
__label__0 you can't get the sound to stop looping once you make it to a save slot. you have to restart the phone..
__label__1 I loved the 80s and this brings back all the good times. Really its worth it!! U have to get it!!!!!
__label__0 It's a shame to see Konami squander a trademark. The original music is gone an replaced by the sort of thing you'd hear in a 1993 shareware ripoff, the graphics are &quot;updated&quot; to about 1988 level, action is slowed down, controls are sluggish, an
__label__1 As usual another game that works perfectly on the epic 4g.  Everyone who complains about a game not working right should just step into the big leagues and get an epic, that being said this game is a great classic. The UI is intuitive and responsive.  Th
__label__1 great app replica of the original. controls easy and responsive all things given. I love it, especially when it's the amazon paid app of the day for free. adopt a shelter pet.
__label__0 This app honestly isn't that great.  Its just not the same classic gaming experiance.  Not that fun on kindle fire, don't suggest downloading it.
__label__1 I love the classic games.  And Frogger is a cult favorite.  This game was fun and I am glad I got it.
__label__1 Now I can play this game on my Kindle HD and I love it.I have always loved the frogger games.
__label__1 This game doesn't even come close to lagging on my phone. Anyone experiencing performance issues needs to seriously consider upgrading their device. The controls work perfectly, you can play the game with just one hand. There aren't any buttons, just swi
__label__0 Frogger is a terrific arcade game, without a doubt. It was such a blast, that, like some other great hits, have been ported from system to system (Although not as often as..say....Pac-Man). And now we see Frogger sitting right here on our phones. Is this
__label__0 I thought this would be fun but it was so slow and when I tried to jump it wouldn't do anything. never using this app again.
__label__1 Ahh the memories of playing Frogger on the first computer game venue! I was quite happy to see it as a downloadable app for my Kindle Fire! It is sometimes difficult for "fat fingers" to control the little button that makes the frog jump in specific dire
__label__1 If, like me, you think back fondly on the original Frogger arcade game then this Droid app will be a nice piece of nostalgia for you. The controls on a touchscreen can be a little, well, touchy. With a little practice you'll be dodging cars and hopping l
__label__0 I bought this app for my Kindle Fire  because I loved Frogger when it was popular when I was young. I downloaded the app but I couldn't get it to start. I wouldn't get off the home screen of the game. Very disappointed. I called Amazon and got my money b
__label__0 I downloaded this despite the 2.5 star rating &amp; I now understand why it has such terrible reviews.Some will tell you that the 1 star ratings are just people complaining to complain; that there's nothing wrong with this game. The truth is, this game f
__label__1 Ribbit!! What a fun game! I have loved Frogger ever since I was a child. I am so happy they have it for the Kindle! Great game and highly recommended! Don't kill the little frogs!
__label__0 I installed it, went to go onto the android market, and and it wouldn't let me on because I needed to log into my google account. Because of the permissions, I uninstalled this game, and all of a sudden I could get into my market without logging in! Wtf 
__label__0 It was hard to move the frog.  It does not play like the origional arcade game when i was young.
__label__0 The game makes you drag frogger to his destination, which is not cndusive to the fast action play style required. Samsung Epic
__label__1 I can't keep up with the real fast games and this brings back the days of the Atari,,,,, for you younger people that was the game that started it all, well pong was but that was different... this is a fun little game for my kindle..... all ages will like
__label__1 Love playing this game and it kept my 2 year old grandson excited.  he kept saying froggy mushed when the car or truck rode over him
__label__0 Slow, and not very good. The original was way better. This is not worth buying let alone downloading for free.
__label__0 I was pretty excited to try this app out although it had a few bad reviews. The first time I played I randomly died sitting on a log waiting to make a move. I figured I would give it another try. Second time playing I died in the same spot, safely sittin
__label__0 I disallowed the excessive permissions using LBE Security.Getting the game started was a problem, had to tap literally dozens of times on the menus before anything would happen.Gameplay was marginal. Did not properly scale to screen (right side of screen
__label__1 glad to see more cool app/games like this on here.once i saw what it was i was hoping finally a day without one star reviews, boy was i wrong, i am starting to  believe, that there is a small group of people on here that always, without fail, rate every 
__label__0 the game is in a mini screen mode that you can not enlarge, makes it extremely difficult to play. Don't bother.
__label__0 Well I tend to not listen to reviewers because you never know who is the developer or who the haters(competition) are. But I wish I had gone with my gut on this one. The controls are basic just like I remembered. but the background music seems to get stu
__label__0 Why do you need my location and read phone calls to play a game?  Not installing this game not even for free
__label__0 There is no reason this game should require GPS information, or a network connection. Completely unacceptable.  I would like to see more classics, totally free.  Your programmers don't need to eat or pay rent.
__label__1 Amazon says &quot;not compatible&quot;, I say works fine.  Great retro game, i should know, i dropped many a quarter on the arcade version.
__label__0 bad choice you MUST NOT GET I thought it ruined my kindle so bad I cant stand it really.LISTEN,DO NOT BUY
__label__0 Gps and internet for full version of frogger? No thanks. No need for either except for tracking purposes, which doesn't sit well with me.
__label__0 For all we know the permission to to send out known accounts could and probably some thing where they sell their info to companies. suspicious. DO NOT DOWNLOAD! !!!!!!
__label__1 Never cared for the original arcade version, but this one is very cool. Works great on my Atrix 4G. Great work!
__label__1 The game works perfectly on EVO. None of the issues reported were experienced. The EVO has a 4.3&quot; screen. Looks beautiful no distortion or black bars. The controls are simple...just swipe in the direction you want frogger to move. The pace is more w
__label__0 The controls for this game are absolutely horrible. Doesn't respond to input at all. Also die on the side of the road occasionally.
__label__1 Haha its real fun to use this app. i want voice of monkey in it to tease mah friend lol :0)
__label__1 A great little app!  A true time killer!  Having a blast sending stuff to my kids and sister!  Installed and runs perfect on my Samsung Fascinate.
__label__1 a. its freeb. its really fun!i sang the star spangled banner and played it in all the different voices.i also captured my cat meowing and it was pretty funny.app does what it says.easy to use and very fun!
__label__0 This app is good for speeding up or slowing down the frequency of your voice. It's good for nothing else.
__label__0 The only explanation is that my location (together with who-knows-what) is being collected.Hey Amazon, you were supposed to prevent these quasi-malware apps from entering your Appstore - not promoting them!
__label__0 Then it wears off and then you're looking for another app to play with. Not even sure what drew my attention to this app.
__label__0 I think I sleep installed this (dontask) anyway saw it on my phone and tried it. we'll to say the least the app was complete crap so I uninstalled it only to get a thanks for subscribing 9.99 a month text. so if you load this up check your bill
__label__0 Waste of time and yours just another app to keep you entertained for a few minutes that you will never get bake
__label__0 The app itself is fun with a lot of great options. However it sucked the lifeblood out of my G2. About 10 minutes into using it, my G2 got SO slow that it was not useable. I immediately uninstalled this app, and the phone was instantly returned back to i
__label__1 This voice changer is great.  We have alot of fun with it. Try to record someone without them knowing and listen to it.  That seems to make it funnier.
__label__1 I have used this to make custom ringtones for friends and family many times now.  Its also a great time kil with kids and fun to use to play tricks on people at parties.
__label__0 Caused my phone to freeze up and reboot itself several times after install.  Pretty cool app otherwise.  This was on an HTC Incredible
__label__0 This is really bad. First of when I tried to use the voice effects it wouldn't play. Then when I tried to exit out to the home screen it freezes. Really bad app I deleted once I got it :(
__label__1 Anything that will entertain the kids for awhile, gets 5 stars. Is it juvenile? Yes. But the app is a good one. Lots of options, plus you can save it for later embarrassment.I also think I may try the 'backwards' option while playing some songs that have
__label__1 This little app is soon much fun. Everyone has to get in on saying something when you bring it out.
__label__1 First of all, thank you to the dev for making this great app  free! I have been playing with it, and not only is it a decent recorder in its own right, but the options are fun and they work very well! Cheers on a great, fun app that is so much fun to pla
__label__0 Shame on you!!!This was a science project at school right?  If so, I give you a B+ grade.  If you are an adult, don't give up your day job as I know children that can write apps better than this.
__label__1 I think this app is great . Its probly the best voice changer app there is.when I got it it didnt tell me how to save the recordings though.I figured out that it was the botton to the left , it sort of lookes like a printer . Anyways I really recomend th
__label__0 it is gross.  don't buy it. it is so disgusting. I don't like it. so don't buy it. it is so hilarious. don't even look at it.
__label__0 This is the worst game EVER even my kids hate it its just throwing money away never buying games from these makers again. By the way never waste ur $0.99 on it!!!
__label__0 the kindle fire doesn't even has a camera. the kindle fire hd does but it doesn't have a camera in the back so that would be a big waste of money
__label__0 I'm sorry if this is rude, but I don't know why anyone would want this. This is probably one of the stupidest apps I have ever seen on the amazon app store, and trust me i've seen a few. I can already tell by the reviews that it is a waste of time. Don't
__label__1 I love this app when you read it the 1st time it is cool then you have to do it to other people
__label__0 The problem with this application is that it is exactly what you expect it to be... Dumb.  Uninstalled after like 2 minutes.
__label__0 okay, it cusses......it promotes suicide. im an adolescent and suicide is a big thing and this aorta offended me being a cutter and all.....but that's just my opinion so whatever still I don't reccomend
__label__1 this appbis so addicting.  I mean the blowing up part is really funny. first you blow up the earth, then you blow up hell and heaven.. so basically, you make the world limbo. its funnier when you get the app. you should really get it. if you don't get it
__label__1 it is cool and it is funny I like it oh! did I ever say it is free to so please play it because it is you know what I'm about to say everybody say it with me ready set say it shut the front door good job everybody oh and good job everybody by the way I f
__label__1 its worth it just to annoy people. load the app and hand it to some one and see how long they go. it was fun on the first go through, now i just like to see how far other people will last.
__label__1 it is awesome and people will love it I like lt two a lot of people want two play it
__label__0 I do not like this app one bit all u do is press the button and it says don 't press the button.don 't download this app!
__label__1 Some people think its a waste of time but its really just an app for people looking to pass the time!! You people saying its a bad game just don't have a sense of humorous obviously!!!
__label__0 wth no this def a waste of time n space. no idea why it has so many ratings. its fun for about 2 clicks n then its time to remove it.
__label__1 I LOVE it, it is so fun I love it if u r looking 4 a game that go's 4 a while and read funny stuff then it's perfect 4 u this is Dan PEACE
__label__1 It is very funny. Mainly the explosions are funny. And when it said the h-word it meant the UNDERWORLD notthe curse word. The game is funny I reccomended it foreveryone.
__label__1 this app is great! not much to say. get it get it get it! blah balh blah blah blah blah.
__label__1 this game is so much fun because I like pushing buttons.push push push.so anyway read the text it FUNNY!!!!#!!!!f.is for funny.u.u should get it.n.never dingier button pushing.
__label__0 this game is the stupidest app I have ever gotten before because all u do is hit a button over and over again and all it does is repeat the story sou would not get this app
__label__0 um. Just read the title of this review again. Do you get the idea now? I sure hope so.  'nuff said.
__label__0 I don't  know why its on my kindle  I want it delete , please sent message how to delete because manage my kindle did not delete them for me
__label__1 I love this app it is awesome and I think they should get one that does toilet humorous then it would be like tart peer pooop
__label__0 This game is amusing once but needs more stories or a longer story. I did not want to stop playing but the story ran out so I deleted the game. Please add more makers of the game! Oh, I would never pay for it so if they start charging for it do not buy!
__label__0 It really is just a button on the screen. That's it. I was bored after about a minute. I thought, &#34;Haha this will be hilarious.&#34; No, not at all.
__label__0 Duh. Someone must of been really bored to sit around and create this. Again, duh. &infin; _ _ _ _
__label__0 this game is fun the first time but it just repeats its self don't waste your space and get it you'll hate it
__label__0 I downloaded this game and it was fun for about 2 seconds but then it got stupid don't get this app waste of time
__label__1 its just a fun way of wasting ur time if ur bored! geez people lighten up. you basically press the red button and it tells u ti stop, etc. it has sounds on it too, so watch out!
__label__1 This app literally had me on the floor laughing! The comments the button makes are hilariously rude, but of course, it's funny! When I showed my friends the had the same reaction as I did. If you are having a bad day and need to laugh at something, like 
__label__1 I prolly would have given a 4 star because I've done the whole red button thing on the internet years ago, and it was funny as hell back then when it was fresh, shiny, and new. But I gave it 5 stars to try to counter the negative nancys reviewing this ap
__label__1 This game is so simple yet so funny. I just texted all my friends and told them to buy it to.
__label__1 Can some one  say, &#34;How to keep a child entertained and reading for 30 mins or more.&#34; Just give them the phone and tell them not to press the button! They never follow directions and this hold their interest for a while; very funny.
__label__1 To be honest at first I was too scared to press the button. But the more I pressed it the funnier it became. SO I JUST COULDN'T STOP!!!Even when it started repeating, it was still funny. It's always fun to watch your friends play it. SO IN YO FACE,PEOPLE
__label__0 I got this and it is the worst game ever created. All you do is press a button when you're not suppose to. Even when I stopped I had to press the button,  because nothing happens when you leave it be.
__label__0 This app is a waste of time, and very wired. I don't like what happens at the end. Very lame.
__label__0 the app will never satisfy me even if this so called &quot;appzap&quot; company updates it the best thing about this app is the price
__label__0 wow that's a little stupider!  who ever made this must be a total loser don't get it unless ur an ediot
__label__1 Me and my cousin played with this for a while and it's really cute.  I didn't want him to push the red button and he kept on insisting.  Kept making us laugh.  Pretty entertaining in a crazy sort of way.  Fun to mess with.
__label__1 This is the best game I have ever play see ya on the game Try this stinking game I'm worning you you will love it if you don't like this game suckit up because you will not like it you'll. love it Peace.
__label__0 You press a red button then it sends messages to you for doing it because you aren't supposed to.If you think the Sunday comics, a pie in the face gag, or &quot;America's Funniest Home Videos&quot; are funny ... then it might be for you.
__label__1 it is so funny!If it said I will cut your head in a toothbrush kind of way I would laugh so much I would cry.
__label__0 I don't like this game . Because this game does NOT have a touch of fun in it. Do NOT get it and all you do is touch one button then it will say STOP well of course I didn't stop so then it did 8 buttons. Then like 44 buttons please don't listen to the o
__label__0 This app is completely boring! I was expecting some scary face or something to pop-up in the screen, but this stupid app just repeats itself! It's no- doubt a 0 star app! In other words: DEFINITE TIME WASTER! D: not recommended for anyone with a life!
__label__1 it is amazing but i think it says heaven blows up witch is horrable but other that that awesome super fun
__label__0 THIS WAS THE BIGGEST TIME WASTER EVER IT SUCKED BIG TIME. IT WAS SO BAD MY REVIEW IS IN CAPS!!!!
__label__0 this is so stupid it just says stuff like don't touch the button don't touch the button again if you touch the button 1more time the world.will explode don't install this app it sucks
__label__1 this was the best app ever I laughed the whole time great job anyone who doesn't like this u don't know what fun is
__label__0 it was fun at first but once I saw my daughter play it and it said that it would recommend suicide. and up to 9 layer of hell and that you exploded. heaven and hellI do not regimens for young children
__label__0 this app is both inappropriate and quite intolerant because alot off its content is offensive and i highly recommend not to get this app
__label__1 I love this app. Its so addicting, yet so point less. I reccomend it for anyone that is bored and has nothing to do, or is just looking for a little humor. All you have to do is press a button. Its that simple! haha (:
__label__1 ok that was a super fun game the part when it said boom a screamed but these ppl apparently. don't have a sense of humor they are stupid who ever made this game up THEY NEED TO make another game like this Ps don't waste your time looking for the white bu
__label__1 To have lots of fun you have to read the text! For all of you who gave this app 1 star read the funny  TEXT!!!!!!!!! This game is very super fun!!!!!!!!!
__label__1 This game is amazing ( not even a game)  ITS A BUTTON!! idk why but this is hilarious. Get this game!!!
__label__1 Love this app! I think it is awesome. I did not want to put it down. it is good if you are bored. and it's free.
__label__1 Ok I don't know how I have  become addicted to this app but I will be honest.I'm addicted.The captions are a little funny. But I wish it would say something else if you don't press the button. Like, &ldquo;Thank you for not pressing this button&quot; or 
__label__0 this app sucks. I lode it to my k fier and deleted. it right away all it did even. when u pushed. the button. is repeted its self &iexcl;&iexcl;&iexcl;&iexcl;&iexcl;
__label__0 This is by far the dumbest app I've downloaded yet. Don't press the red button, so of course you do. Then it has some smart alec remark at the bottom so you press it again. And again and again. That's it. That's all you do. Nothing else happens. WHY?????
__label__1 This is so funny. It is AWESOME. I'm addicted. I had to play it like 5 times before came here and wrote the review.
__label__1 It's funny the first time. It's really cool to show to friends. But after that, it's pointless. Give it a try. You know you want to.How can people possibly complain over something free like this? Were they expecting something epic with a name like this?
__label__0 all you do is press a bitten an seriously I'm its not even funny. &gt;:( I hate it it is so stupid.
__label__1 Cool app it is so fun and funny I prefer it for you good time wasterGood bye see ya
__label__1 I wrote one like this way back in the DOS days. I love it and very intelligent people I show it to can't put it down.
__label__1 such a funny game! o laugh every time! P.S. PRESS THE RED BUTTON!!!!!  haha hahaha hahahahaha ha haha haha haha
__label__1 this button is solo funny! he is so random, too. but the funny kind of random. but he gets mean. but its funny when he gets mean because he says he will do things he is unable to do. seriously. I mean there's no way he could ever do the things he says he
__label__0 i really didnt get this app at all the cover of the app may seem interesting but not as some of you would hope
__label__0 Tried this just to see if it would work with the Droid X2. It does. But useless and boring program. In my opinion.
__label__1 very fun app. I don't know why people r giving it bad reviews, because this app just rocks. I would totally recommend it.
__label__1 it is five star the first time u play but then stuiped.so u get play it delete that's what I did but u may not just get it it is funny
__label__1 this app is so stupid it is amazingly hilarious! yeah it says some choiceful words but! it is supposed to be taken light heartedly! it is a red button for Pete sake! its not like it means it! I cracked up when I started to push the red button. it will ge
__label__0 its a dumb App do not get it it tells u r gonna die and the world ending like wat the heck also to comit suicide and to go to hell and one more thing it SUCKS!!!!!!!!! don't wast ur time
__label__1 great time waster and a good laugh. looking forward to the kids playing with and seeing they're reaction! BOOM! still looking for that white button though :P
__label__0 The rules obviously say that you have to be 13 or older to leave a review. There are definitely younger children than that leaving them. There HAS to be a way to make sure that these ridiculous reviews are deleted or not even placed here. I have seen so 
__label__1 at first its really funny well the whole first time u do it and the second time it gets old quick but I recommend getting lt its fun and if u donit to others to its goodz.
__label__0 Waste of time and space on your device. Don't download it, it's not fun at all. Even if it is free, you will regret wasting that time.
__label__1 this is a very good app for killing time or giving it to a friend to press but the only rule... do not press the button
__label__1 My friend has it on her ipod and when she let me play it I so wanted it. so I got it. if you want to get a funny app. get dumb ways to die it id HILARIOUS
__label__1 this app is hilarious I have to admit it, this a great time waster. it wouldn't be fun the second time though but that is the way it is I would like it to say different things.
__label__1 hi my name is Elizabeth Chyenne Cline and I think this app is awesome and the most funest game that I have ever played in my whole entire life :) :) :) :b :p :v :o
__label__0 I HATE THIS APP DO NOT GET IT. WASTE OF SPACE.ALL IT DOES IS INSULT U.THE PEOPLE WHO GAVE OVER 1 STAR ARE NOT SO SMART.AND THEY LIKE RUDE THINGS.PLEEEEEEEEAAAAAASE TAKE MY ADVISE AND DO NOT GET THIS APP
__label__1 Its so funny. You cant really do much with this app, but it just a fun app. After you read all of it, it just repeats and repeats.
__label__1 This app is THE ABSOLUTE BEST for curing boredom. Show it to your friends, and I am absolutely sure they will laugh. That is all there is to this hilarious app. So simple, and yet so funny. There is amazing character in the narrator, and the puns are THE
__label__1 And it doesn&apos;t get much better than that. It loops eventually, but the dialog is witty. Enjoy it, even one smile is worth it.
__label__0 It is a waiste of download .  Do not download. It would be better if there alot of different colors.
__label__0 you just press the right button and that's all. I had it unistalled, I've got better things to do rather then just randomly press buttons. for some of you this app might be great, but for me it was pointless.
__label__1 a sense of humor. Don't bother. Not something *you're* going to play more than once, but cool to give to others. Earned its 5 stars it is what it says it is. Whatever you do however, DON'T PUSH THE RED BUTTON.
__label__1 I like it but its has the h word in it but it is very funny and cool. So people who is reading this please play it please????Peace out home rommyes lol I love me!!! Am I fuuny??
__label__0 I'll tell you all you would want to know about his game. It sucks, the quality is disgusting, the buttons aren't even realistic, the &quot;harder&quot; levels stink. It's just a terrible game made for terrible people.
__label__1 ...ALL DAY LONG! Seriously! AND, I recommended it to all my friends.How much productivity is being lost daily from just this one app?
__label__0 it just loops back around when you are done. not fun at all. sorry but I am going to uninstall.
__label__0 all it does is say mean things to you. at the end of the story he tells you, it starts over and doesn't shuffle anything onceoever.
__label__0 this game is stupid. i mean really stupid. i just tells you to keep pressing the button but nothing happens. at first i thought that the game was just an ad but no it wad the freaking game!! it sucked.so don't get it ....thank you and good nite
__label__0 Not interesting. Not inventive. If you have the attention span of a moth, you might find yourself continuously gravitating towards this app. If not then you, like me removed it from your device!
__label__0 don't ever get this app because it says you a a moron so never get this app K never buy this app
__label__0 If you have about 10 minutes that you would like to kill then you should download this... play it for 10 minutes, and then delete it.  It's not worth the space to keep it on your device.
__label__0 this app is nit entertaining not is it funny. when I first saw it I thought I would just dismiss the bad reviews but it really is a pointless, useless, and non entertaining!!!!
__label__0 Dumb. There is no good reason to download this app.  Total waste of time. Sure, it 's harmless enough. And pointless.
__label__1 Do Not Press The Red Button.  Another mind game, albeit simple, to keep the mind active.  Good for all ages.  Time consuming and slightly mind numbing.
__label__1 hahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha! That is so funny I like the story at the end. Its a good app. And I'm glad its free
__label__0 This is a SUPER STUPID app! I hate it! Its for like 3 year olds. That's all I have to say about this dumb app. Don't waste your time downloading thus silly app.
__label__0 At first when I saw this I thought it be kind of like &quot;The Moron Test&quot;. I was thrilled since it was in the top 100 out of 10 THOUSAND apps!!! When I first played it I thought it was OK. It was when it repeated the same stupid conversation like 
__label__0 i cant beleive it actually took longer to download this and install then it did to lose all interest in it.  then i continue to waste time to uninstall and write this review.  find something better to do with 5 minutes of your life.
__label__0 What started off as semi-humorous QUICKLY became non-entertaining and boring. there's no point to this app. good thing it's free!
__label__0 this app is totally inappropriate it keeps telling u to commit suicide and go to hell and that ur mother would hate you. not cool.
__label__1 its really funny and its there when ur bored but y would u put the h word I mean wit if there r kids that got this app but I like it :p
__label__1 its so fun my 10 year old daughter loves it but it says the H word but MUST GET IT!!!!!
__label__0 this game has to be the most birding game I have ever played if you want to be bored to death by this game.
__label__1 its point less yes,  but very entertaining. Great time waster,  and really it can keep me entertained for hours. Is it because I'm an idiot? Nipper that's not it...
__label__0 I loved it.....not terrible fun at first but omg terrible do not get it boring not fun at all well ok I exaggerated but it does get boring trust me even my 4 year old little brother hated it ok does that tell you anything a 4 year old hates a stupid game
__label__0 Some things are great pointless, but this app is definatly not one of them. Might be a little better if they could actually spell. Not even worth a free download.
__label__1 u should totally get it its free and then it is awesome its very funny. thats wat its meant to be like u should at least try it!  :-]
__label__0 I hats this app I loaded itcand showed my friends and that wanted to brake tho prone wost game ever
__label__1 this app is sooooo funny it makes me giggle every time I play IT! he just keeps going and never stops it is awesome! I would totally recommend it to anyone!!!!!
__label__1 this app is soooooooo funny in a dumb way its so irresistible to touch the red button *urk *. I'm 13 and its really fun for everyone over my age because it has swears.
__label__0 this is so stupid I would rate zero if it let me I suggest Oregon settler instead buy that game
__label__0 This app is more than useless. It was a waste of bandwidth to even download it. I want my MBs back!
__label__0 this thing is so dumb I didn't. even have to finsh the game to know that really don't get it it will make u cry
__label__0 cant even get past first level confusing and stupid a b c d e f g this is more fun then the game singing the Abc's
__label__1 this app was so funny and entertaining that I just could not stop playing it! I also love the twist ending. you should definitely get this awesome app!
__label__1 awesome I love it I like pressing fed buttons it is very fun!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  and you can play it all day and not get board of it rocks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
__label__1 this game is so adicting and it is relly funny as the button tryst to get you to stop pushing him. you need to by  this game it is so fun :)
__label__0 all you do is press the red butten,and if you don't press the red bitten well....the game is over see what I meek,such a rip off know wonder it was free.
__label__0 on a scale of 1 to 10 it would be a 1.5 it is kind of funny until i reached the part where it made noise i had the sound on full and couldn't hear right for the rest of the day. DO NOT BUY THIS IS STALE.
__label__1 lol this game is great my 3 year old loves it but it says to many bad words.but great game
__label__1 my new favorite thing to do. its hilarious and a great way to spend time. definitely worth downloading if you like senceless humorous
__label__0 this game is so stupid this guy is just telling us stupid stuff this game doesn't even earn a star that's how stupid this game is
__label__0 This app is not amusing and it is really no fun. It stinks! I think it is a really retarded. Nobody I mean nobody should get this app at all. I didn't even want to give it one star
__label__1 Loosen up, people! This app was meant to be funny and idiotic. So what if it only entertains you for a minute or so? It's great to show friends and to have a little laugh about it!
__label__0 The only reason this game is so high in ratings is because people see the &quot;do not press&quot; and they just download it , this game is really immature
__label__0 wow I blew up the earth thats for little kids but  it's great on kindle fire I absolutely hate this game.
__label__0 this app is repetitive and mean. what kind of app says u blew up the world, heven, and hell, I mean really! don't get the evil app, please.
__label__1 I meant to write all that in this onea s d x z w e r f c v ft. a s e e s s ss s s s s s s s s ss s s s s s s s s ss ss s s
__label__0 I saw that most of u said it was good but its not entertaining at all its the most boring. app In the intire. world
__label__0 so all you do is press a stupid button &amp; it insults u? why would u want to get that?!?!?
__label__1 I love this game because it is so hilarious. expecly the ending part. I totally recommend this game for anyone who likes to tick off people.
__label__0 I don't get the point. nor did I think it was funny, but I don't know why seem people are freakin' out about it. Dumb! Delete!
__label__0 ALL YOU DO IS PRESS A RED BUTTON AND READ THE TEXT THAT IT GIVES YOU. THE STUPID RED BUTTON SAYS THINGS LIKE WHY DONT YOU KILL YOURSELF OR YOUR DEAD AND BECAUSE OF YOU SO IS HEAVEN AND HELL. ITS DUMB THEN THE GAME REPEATS ITSELF SO I DELETED IT IN TWO MI
__label__0 This app works well but it says stuff like &quot;BOOM! You've exploded Heaven and Hell!&quot; &quot; You exploded the earth!&quot; The creators of this game are STUPID!! My Best friends Sister Played this shes only five and she really thought she explode
__label__1 hi I love this game it is soooo a waste of time I just live it. :) thankyou for making this app :) .
__label__1 this game seems really fun to me I can say it is funny to the words the animal says so that's all I have to say good buy.
__label__1 it is fin the sayings are cute and its pretty fun to play it isn't something I would do for 5 hours straight but its free so it was worth the download
__label__0 this is the worst appli ever. who rated this 4 or 5stars? no way. just wasted time. i don't understand why this is the top sales in amazon.
__label__1 This app is basically like reading a short story where you prompt the next page by pressing the red button which the narrator is constantly telling you not to press and making fun of you the whole time.  The product page description is worth checking out
__label__1 i love it!!! it is hilarious!!!! it is super funny and makes me smile and laugh! good to show to friends!!
__label__1 funny !!!! makes me laugh 90% or the time :) hahahahaha lolz. , and the a elephant it on top.of the button!!!!!!!!!!
__label__1 It is a good time killer, but it isn't hilarious. You should probably get it. I did. It is okay.
__label__1 its fun but wen it repeat itself its gets boring work with me Its awesome because of the funny words
__label__0 padded reviews for a piece of junk... boo. lets try harder next time.. mmm k? . .  ..  j j
__label__1 I laughed my butt off while clicking the button. I screamed while laughing, unexpecting a random sound effect. I recommend this to anyone who loves clicking buttons, laughing, being insulted. and ignoring subtitles.
__label__0 A prime example of a waste of bytes. Even kids under age 10 will only get an hour or so's use out of it...
__label__0 This game seemed sort of ok for the first couple of minutes, I thought that it would be like the moron test but instead it was just rude! It tells you that you are going to die, and blow up the world! Do you really want to play a game like that? Its also
__label__0 this game is sooooooo pointless. But actually a great time waster I finally deleted it cuz I had the conversation memorized! DON'T DOWNLOAD!!!!!!
__label__1 I like do not press red button because it got my in a good mood and its care od funny
__label__1 The button like.. talks to u. It so funny but I wish it said more though. He begs for u to stop pressing the button. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS APP.
__label__0 This app is bull poop. Why would someone want BULL POOP?!??! And by the way AppZap, here's  some advice: just because it's free, doesn't mean people will want to buy it. :(
__label__1 I know all of you people give this app low ratings but the app is made to be funny so don't Hate on it. I still don't get how it is number six on the list though
__label__1 It's not really an app, just a loop of the red button joke, which I find funny personally. Not really something to use all the time, but it's good for a joke now and then.
__label__0 this is the dumbest thing since sliced bread. not funny and now I get to waste more time trying twenty words.  almost done I think
__label__1 I an not sure what I expected but this was not what I expected. Very clever  fun and people, it is FREE stop complaining... I got more than my moneys worth so to speak
__label__0 Don't download this lame attempt at humor.  If you think carrot top is funny MAYBE you'll get entertainment out of this, but I seriously doubt it.
__label__1 Its fun and cute, but I'm not the kind of guy who can keep playing this kind of game. But I got it as a free app, and it was fun once or twice.
__label__0 this game sucks. when I first played this game I almost died so don't play this game buy a free gazer gun for your apps
__label__1 There is a point . It's an Awesome time killer ( it's everything you want in a app and more).That button in my opinion is awesome , but it's not as eye popping as EVIL ( so thats why i put that in my title ok).
__label__0 This is the stupidest app ever.  Even for free, it costs too much.  It's like when a four year old says something funny, and people laugh, so said child repeats it a hundred times, ever louder, thinking he can duplicate the reaction over and over.  Yeah.
__label__1 this was the best thing to do very fun and funny did I say how fun this app is to fun for words fun fun fun
__label__1 This was so much fun! A few capitalization errors but, overall this was very entertaining. I will keep it installed just so my friends can have a good laugh too.
__label__0 it was absolutely horrible I hated it so much I deleted it, then I hot it again just so I could delete it a second time
__label__1 That was funny! It can keep an idiot busy for a very extremely long time! Lol! What fun this game
__label__0 Do you think hell is a good thing to say to kids think you teens it is nothing ti you but to kids it is a knew word and bad word if you are 8 or under don't get it it is just dumb and if you think bad words are cool the are not.
__label__1 I absolutely love this app it is sooo funny and its free so you should get it its perfect for when your bord!! get it!!
__label__1 It is very funny and time consuming to read and play with this little red button but I loved it.
__label__1 this game is so very funny. actullay its more hilarious. I mean there is this crazy, grumpy and fun narrator who gives u these fun quizzes that if u play all of them last up to like twenty full minutes. I mean if ur waiting to get something u can just pl
__label__1 the app is very entertaining. it is so funny. I hope this person can make a don't press the green button,blue button, green button, pink button, and so on. download it
__label__0 It keeps telling you to commit suicide and that your mom will hate you! I finally deleted the app after it told me I was dead about 20 times.I found that this was the worst game ever!
__label__1 please let me have it. It is so cool and I love it. It is taunting me to get it.
__label__1 to me it is hilarious. that he keeps telling me not to press it and then it makes that little explosive sound. its pretty good it use the h word but its still funny.
__label__0 ok it sours fun but no. it just keep telling you dont press the red bottom.then after time it says your dead. then the voice says it is going to sleep. then it starts over.
__label__1 REALLY FUNNY app. Do not press the big red button. If you do, just find out what will happen. You know you wanna. Do it.
__label__1 this is a everyday thing the first time u play it its so FUNNY fun fun fun fun fun!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! FUN
__label__0 this app is not what I thought it was.  It's stupid and not even funny.  worst app I've ever purchased even if it was for free....
__label__1 I thought it was really funny. It made me laugh a lot. I recommend this app to people who like pushing buttons and laughing. This app may be really stupid to you or you may like it. Give it a try.
__label__1 When I need to keep someone occupied for a few minutes, this is a great one.  I hand them my Kindle, and when I come back, the person is always still there, pressing buttons, with a silly grin on his/her face, and occasionally laughing out loud..  So muc
__label__1 It is really fun to press the button and annoy the the text more. This is super hilarious!!Made me laugh like crazy !!!!!!!!!!
__label__1 This game is so addicting! I've had my whole familly play it. I love the ones where it turd into like a million little red buttons. Oh yeah and the other one when it turns into an elephant
__label__0 was curious to what this was since none of the reviews were specific.  you try to hit the button and different phrases pop up while the button moves around the screen telling u to not hit the button. glad it was free and that it only wasted my time.
__label__1 gees peoples, this is meant as a joke. and if you are mad at it fir saying hell then loosen up. I grew up with my family saying that word and even worse stuff. this game is fun.me gusta queso
__label__1 watch tophatvideos on youtube and you will get 500x the amusement of this game...this game is amusing and makes u laugh...although it has no end it is fun. but wen it talks about the white button don't waste ur time looking 4 it because u wont find it.
__label__1 This app is fun and is meant to be a joke. If you guys don't like it,  then you must not get the joke. Take a joke people. I played this app several times and still found it fun. I would recommend it, if you have a sense of humor
__label__1 The only problem with this app is there is no music. Live this app, but my boss doesn&apos;t. I got put on a probation period cause I was using this at work and not helping customers. Wth? I love my evo 4g, leave me alone. :-)
__label__1 Omg its sooo funny it gets me every time I LOVE IT. whoever say a bad review if u don't like u soooo much then y do u even put a review about it personally if I were u I wouldn't write one anyways seriously this game is soooo awesomeBTW: if u put any rat
__label__0 This app is fun but as you get towards the end it starts to insult you and tells you to go to the place under everything! NEVER GET THIS APP
__label__0 I pressed every single button on the one that had like one hundred red buttons and it dident approve.so that is why.
__label__1 Human nature...you have to press the button cause you are told not to. Then you keep pressing to see the next message and you keep getting told.to stop.Its amusing. I wish it would change ideas though rather than looping. Worth getting for nothing and sh
__label__1 ok this app is meant to be stupid, thats the novelty of it. i love the dialouge of the guy, whoever it is. i could play this all day...
__label__1 This app is awesome, and I love to trick my friends with it. The red button is a story on an endless loop. I love the hilarious commentary from the button. Great :-)
__label__1 Yes, get this app!  It does NOT tell you to go to hell but in fact is a halarious way to pass time. The first time I played it, I laughed so hard I cried! :D
__label__0 l wish this game never came out becquerel it is the stupidest game in the world it should get zero stars because it is not even funny
__label__0 I hats this app. when it told me to commit suicide I was really mad. suicide isn't to joke about.
__label__0 the app was funny for me but I don't think kids 9 and under should play it it says rude things and says bad words it also says things that slung kind of evil.
__label__1 This was soo much fun, but it does say a cuss word 3 times. So I wouldn't recommend it to small children.
__label__1 why does everyone hate this app it does what it says it will j j j j j j j Nb j j bb j
__label__1 I liked this tame very much. was a lot of fun. I especially like the part when he says that hes not dead hes just text.
__label__0 don't get this app it just said don't press it again.now is that stupid or what?stupid right. I hate it so much
__label__1 This is soooo funny!!!!  I love it &gt;&lt;  Its plain funny, and I went through it with my brother and he was laughing so hard and so was I. XDDDDD
__label__1 really your not gonna go to hell and the world did not exploed and there is no white dot so the dot is lying and I do think its funny but I don't laugh
__label__1 yes some jerks would say its stupid but no its not stupid! in my opinion its a brain twister. excellent for younger children. I'm 100% sure!!!!!!!!!!!!!!-Madyson A. Cooper
__label__0 TO ALL PEOPLE:if u r reading this comment very soon the only red button u will be pressing is the DISTROY THIS APP FOREVER button!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
__label__1 I don't know why everyone says it is so stupid. it is actually really funny. I laugh every time. it is so hilarious. I love ot. it makes me and my friends occupied and it keeps us lathing for hours and hours.
__label__1 this is so funny! I loved and it still keeps me laughing! if you need a good laugh, download this app!
__label__1 its hilarious..... the text is so mean but who cares its funnier....  lol........ I play jokes on mi frnds wit it..... they gt seo mad
__label__0 I just don't understand how to make this work.  It's very confusing. This is just what I have done review
__label__1 its a good game its really funny it is the best game ever I am glad he or she made itI like the way it starts over do not press the red button
__label__0 I wouldn't waste your time on this app. it is very repetitive and get old way to fast. I wasted about a half hour of my life pressing a stupid ditgital button.
__label__1 its fun for a bit.  the secret to it is to go through it 20 times.  when you do that there is a cool end with a link to a website.  its actually worth the time to do it.  good luck and have fun.
__label__1 Best app. Fun, funny and entertaining. Best it is free so you can&apos;t complain about anything. Just dune random weiss fit the reentry bring mfg mfg jfk ideal posh bck buck lcm
__label__1 GggggggggggggggRrrrrrrrrrrrrrrEeeeeeeeeeeeeTtttttttttt tame fun and Dumb. oveal silly talking button game would pay 1doller /inmature but fumnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn.  must buy oh wait FREE
__label__0 this is truly a dumb app. all u do is repeatedly press a button while being insulted and told to go to h***. I cant even think of why somebody would want this. basically, it is only fun for people who enjoy being made fun of repeatedly. that is all this 
__label__1 this is really creepy cause I don't know what 2 do and what is gonna happen if I do can someone plz tell me!!!
__label__0 1-THIS WAS COPIED OFF THE ORIGINAL GAME FOR PC2-REPEATS3-PRESS IT4-YOU KNOW YOU WANT *SHUT UP STUPID APP*5-SAYS STUFF LIKE&quot;YOU ARE GOING TO HELL&quot; AND &quot;HEAVEN AND HELL IS GONE BECAUSE OF YOU&quot;Where is the report button?
__label__1 it is really tempting to press a red button any day so on this app you can press it without blowing something up or causing ww3
__label__0 So, I downloaded it because my cousin wanted to check it out. I admit, it entertained the both of us for about 20 seconds. This is not a game, it's a poorly made button made for purely entertainment reasons...there is no storyline or levels that you have
__label__0 extremely boring and repetative. thats the first words.that come to mind. and i have to say this is the worst app i have yet downloaded. that is DEFINITLEY saying somthing
__label__0 What is the big deal about this app? This app is so stupid! I do not think the swear words or any other abusive language does threaten me. What's so fun about this app! You just press a red button the whole time!!!! Sure what the red button says is funny
__label__0 Well that was pretty dumb if you ask me. What was the point? You just keep hitting the button. Wow
__label__1 this app is great! so funny! it just keeps going. I showed my friend &amp; sheloved it too!******** is what I rate it!
__label__0 all u do is press the bitten and it says words not fun bet there is a better app so don't get this app it is so not worth it
__label__0 This game is horrible. All you do is press a button. Then it says something. I don't like this game.
__label__1 it is awesome and I cant whait to play this game and I'm going to press the red annd I want to see what will happen when I press the red button
__label__1 well when I first tried it I knew withought a doubt it was going to be a silly and funny app! : )
__label__0 This is not for anyone who likes fun. I mean seriously, come on, AppZap. this would be better if the thing had more of an exciting responce. It is so repetitive, it's not even funny. Oh, wait, it is. HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!
__label__1 I loved this on the computer and now I can take it with me on my Galaxy Tab! obviously this is not a game. it&apos;s just a joke type thing to amuse you or your friends.
__label__0 this game is so stupid. all you do is press the red butten and then it says not to press the red bitten.so don't get this game.
__label__1 Gosh, i thought that when i opened the app, i would not press it. I waited, &amp; waited but nothing happened. I thought if i pressed it, something terrible would happen.I did. Want to know what happened?  Well find out for yourself.
__label__1 Very entertaining but as said before it is sort of a one time app. You get it, you laugh at it show to a friend and then delete it. but it is really really funny and I reccomend it to anyone who wants a good laugh
__label__0 all I have to say is it just starts over again there is no end don't get it waste of time
__label__1 for all those people who says it tells you to go to hell, and to commit scuicide,  cant take a joke. all it says is that your in a layer of hell. but you explode hell,  and that's good. I still like this app. for anyone who has a sense of humor, this is 
__label__0 i didn't like this because it was kinnda stuipd my little sis didn't like it ether and she is 1 years old this sucks if u ask me. byby! :/ i would give it 0 stars cuz it sucks byby
__label__1 This game was very funny and silly. It is great if you have about 10 minutes to kill. But I have to say, it is not for everyone.
__label__0 it won't download even though I have perfect Internet connection i don't know why it won't and was really looking foward to this game
__label__1 this app is hilarious!once u start u cant stop! p.s. don't waste ur time finding the white button. there isn't one
__label__1 so I just went on tapping this then at the end it said _____________________________________________, lmfao it wad so funny! its worth getting it for fun and entertainment
__label__1 great for those of us who just HAVE TO PUSH  THE BUTTON. but after a minutes, just got boring, ehh
__label__0 This is not a game. you wont win anything. Some may find this entertaining, but i felt offended at theresponses this &quot;game &quot; was programed to give. Not for kids either!
__label__1 I loved all the negative reviews after pressing the button. The instructions said DO NOT PRESS but you went and did it anyways. Great for a laugh especially getting the elephant.
__label__0 This game says swar words and it says i hate you...you suck(ect). IM TELLING YOU DO NOT GET THIS STUPID APP!! The game os really boring i agree that this app should no longer be existing. The people who say that this is fun well they are very very wrong.
__label__1 It's very entertaining! And it's also fun to watch somebody else play it and see their reaction ( my mom ). It's so worth it. :)
__label__0 This is the most pointless game on earth. It`s not even a game.... anybody who likes this game is a complete moron.
__label__1 This game is SOOOOOOO FUNNY u people who but MEAN stuff u just don't know how 2 have fun. If you need me ill be pressing the Big Red Button!
__label__1 isn't this just awesome the only think is that...... it keeps repeating it never stops I love it u will to
__label__0 This is so stupid whoever wrote this was an idiot I'm with the 6 year old this game sucks. I'm out
__label__1 A lot of people say that this game is pointless but who cares? its funny and very entertaining. luv sharing it with my friends!
__label__0 But it's not really worth the time and effort to download. I even feel like I am wasting my time reviewing this.
__label__1 it says not to press it, but you have to, it taunts you and teases you all the way through. just when you actually fear for your life, it's over. whew
__label__1 Lol! Definitely cute. Love blowing up the world. Keeps the kids busy and laughing! Works on my moment. Thank you!
__label__1 super funny also says that the world will explode hailrious if u like a good laugh I would recommending. on getting this app
__label__1 I love this app. it is for people that have a sense of humorous it hilarious I love it but I wish it was a little longer on the story I got a crack out of it. thank you
__label__0 -!? I have wanted this app for some time, now. When I got it, I tried it out I hit it once and I hated it!! After a few more times, I decided it was boring and I deleted it. I expected more from this app. I wouldn't get it, again.
__label__0 Don't Get This. Plz Plz Plz Plz. Don't Get This. My Friends and me Have this game, its Boring.(Warning May Cause Boredom). I don't like this. I like Brussel Sprouts more then this.
__label__1 My kids downloading this and they absolutely love it.  They are always playing this game and like the graphics on it.
__label__1 This "game", while ridiculous, is still fun. I can't imagine playing it often, but it' something to do when you have nothing else to do, or just need to smile. Also fun to have someone else play in front of you or to leave it sitting around where someone
__label__0 i got the game cuase my friend said it was pretty funny. like a crazy person i bought the &quot;update&quot; which just changed probably one phrase.  then i went through it again but it could as a matter a fact make a drunk sober enough to delete it.
__label__0 this app is not the greatest app in the whole world because u don't hardly do anything.I mean all u do is press a red button. and read what it says.don't get this app.'
__label__0 this is good Bhutan not educational.  it does not have a point toot. it is ssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo boring. with a caption BORING. Do not get this game. plus its #100 in the list.
__label__1 This app ensures days of fun and creativity. If I had to rate this game from 1 to 10 on addictiveness, this would easily get a 128,901,428. The developers did an excellent job of recreating an excellent real life hobby of many men and women and maybe enh
__label__0 Unless you have the time and patience, don't get this app. Its not like the Moron test like I thought it was. You just keep hitting the button and quotes come up saying &quot;do not hit the button.&quot; I say, &quot;Do not get.&quot;
__label__0 Not sure that I expected any better, but this is a complete waste of time.  Hopefully nobody made any money on this.
__label__1 this app is cool on on one of the parts aka when the world blows up it makes a boom sound and I got the app when I was in my bed in the dark and I had it on full volume it scared me so bad. I recommend u get this appif u want to laught
__label__0 ur just hitting a stupid button in a box.plus, it takes 10 minutes to do the whole thing if u read the text. then, I got to the end and it didn't even blow up or anything... it just repeats the whole freaking thing(sorry for spoiling it -_- )
__label__0 this I think is the worst app in the world don't wast space for this app its so bad I cant explain how bad it truley is.
__label__0 This game is a rip-off!!!!! All you do is press a stupid button and read what they it thinks. I thought it would be fun, but it wasted my time. Don't buy this app, it must of been created by lameos!
__label__1 i definitely laughed more than a few times.  very original and fun game.  Thank you! Go ahead and get it.  its free.
__label__0 this app only took about five min. to end so then u probobly new what I did with it. total waste of time never download it.
__label__1 works very well on my kindle fire and it is extremely entertaining!! it is definetely worth getting!! its funny too :-) :-)
__label__1 I think this is a really great app. There's a saying that says &quot;rules are meant to be broken&quot; If you don't go by this saying for this app, you'll be sitting with this device in your hand for however long your life is. (Or until you figure out y
__label__1 Not an app to keep, but funny for a download. Kills some time and somewhat amusing. Well made at the least!
__label__1 Ha! Funny, and for everyone saying &quot;this person had too much time on their hands&quot; and you don&apos;t? You&apos;re rating a &quot;Don&apos;t touch the red button app!&quot; We laughed, then uninstalled... Lolz
__label__0 This game is horrible! All you do is push a red button (even though it tells you not to) and it gets smaller. Then, as if to make the game worse, there gets to be more of them! You can't complain that its free, though.
__label__1 this game is amusing and fun but I did not know it had a bad word in it. but other than that I love this game the button teases you.  PUSH THE BUTTON
__label__0 I would not buy this again ... it had no point to the game ... maybe it was just me
__label__0 I do not recommend this button that's it a button press the button and read that's it!! it go's on&infin;and beyond
__label__1 ok people might not like it because it says every time you the button you will go a layer further in you know he-doublehockeysticks and suicide but its really funny five bowl hair cuts out of five like smosh would say :)
__label__1 DO NOT PRESS THE RED BUTTON!!!!!!#!!!!#!!!! This app is so funny I laugh every time I play it. Funny when it say the world will EXPLODE!!!!!!!!!!!!$$!!!!!! So hilarious and annoying to the text saying the stuff. Hi there. I wish I could do the stuff that
__label__0 This app isn't worth more an 10 minutes of your time. Since it only has one storyline, it gets boaring really fast after the second time around. Trust me, unless your someone who likes reading the same story over and over and over again, then this app is
__label__1 love this game it just make have a smile on your face when your down or something this is one of he best
__label__1 I had found this on the computer and thought it was funny so I was soooo happy when I found this app. Its a little glitched but that's just because the buttons in the wrong place.
__label__1 Tjis spp is AWESOME it is a GREAT time killer! Fun for a WHILE untiil you remember what comes next. lol
__label__1 I love this game. It keeps me entertained. My cousin has this app on her iPad and I was laughing the whole time.Those of you that are &quot;concerned&quot; about this game telling you you're going to go to hell don't be. Kids hear &amp; say worse at scho
__label__0 hi I'm 6 years old I got this game on my moms kindle and I guess she played it and it told her the world was going to explode and she would go to the ground
__label__0 this app is pointless and not good. it was fun at first, but then it just got boring. DO NOT GET THIS APP!!!!!!!!!!!!
__label__0 this game isn't worth anyones time, its so lame and a waste of my time.  I had the app for 5 minutes and then after I was finished, I deleted it.
__label__1 I could not stop laughing you should totally get this app its amazing some people say its stupid but its awesome
__label__0 all you do is press the red butternut that is right in front of your face. Don't download. this app just says bad things about you.
__label__0 I liked the game for like 5 minutes and then the whole thing started over so I just deleted it.
__label__1 i dont know what will happen, it says not to press the button.  it is pretty though. i just dont want to blow up the world or something with a simple push of a button so i will just look at it.
__label__0 this app is so stupid all u do is read saying that the red button is saying its really boring don't get this App its a load of crap and a waste of space
__label__1 it is soo funny it makes me entertained but then again I'm one of those people who is easily entertained! if you are one of those people you will absolutely love it......its like the button has its own personality!!!! I love it!!!!!!!
__label__1 I love this app. I have read both stories and they are so funny. I just dont see how this is an infamous app. I laughed my head off the entire time. If you do not like this app then u must not have a sense of humor because this is funny. If you haven't d
__label__0 Don't get it.  All you do is push a red bottom and it says something you have to read. Dumb!!!!!!!!!!!!'!!!!!!!!!!!
__label__1 It is meant to be funny. It is meant to be stupid. If you got it, and read the description, it does what it says. GET IT.
__label__0 they updated this app and added obnoxious advertising.  Not cool, was a cool little mindless bit of entertainment.  No just a useless ad.  Uninstalled.  Don't bother downloading.
__label__1 This app is hilarious! It reminds me of GLaDOS from the Portal games! I highly recommend it to anyone who loves nonsensical humor.
__label__0 this app is terrible!  I hate it I thought it was funny at first but after a few rounds I got bored! do not download! this app is CRAPPY!
__label__1 I touched the red button! It is awesome! Download! Also if you like this game you should download happy poo jump free!
__label__0 Do not get this app!!!!! it is the worst app ever!! I do not like it!! nothing is going to happen!!
__label__0 this game sucks all u do is press da red button nd Nutin happens .DONT GET this CrAP It SUCKS unless all u wanna do.is press da red button forever :/blahh dnt get plz
__label__1 if you have a funny bone in ur body this is going to make that bone go crazy! its fun and funny and everyone should get this game!:D
__label__1 incontinent see how youbleople are so mad I'm strong christen and I'm not offended its just a game have fun with it
__label__1 This is great silly fun. Everyone that I show it to pushes the red button, lol.  My husband thought it was funny, also.
__label__1 I love love love this app!!!!!!! Its great on my kindle fire. Its soliloquy funny watching my friends do this. :)
__label__1 I love this game it rocks Omb it is really awesome I have played it on my friends phone and Omb it like totally rocks I really never have time to download anything so now is my awesome break for thanksgiving this game os awesome yeah
__label__0 this game is stupid and really bad words in it that is not a fun game at do not get it and it is horrible to that is and if you other people like this good for u and I hope you are having a good time stupids
__label__1 if you are bord press the red buutton. I am was bord &amp; my ferend cam over she sode me the red button
__label__1 this app is stupid weird funny get it its free and time cunsuming what will the button say/ do next??????
__label__0 I did not purchase this app because I do not want to waste my space, so I read comments looked at pictures and decided not to get it. A little tip not to waste so much space, red and look at pictures for a good 5 minutes. oh and also comments help too.
__label__1 this is kinds scaring me especially where they say after the world will go boom I'm scared and like its saying that I'm dead
__label__1 Absolutely hilarious...once you start you just "gotta" keep it going. Otherwise you will keep wondering what that next sentance was going to be. I haven't purchased either of the choices given for a new story or visual app. I will be doing so after the R
__label__1 Funny. Clever. Worth the price (free). Can't get laughs any cheaper than this. Did I mention it was unique? Play it.
__label__0 very stupid. it has no point. u hit a red button. the red button does nothing. its pointless. I would not get this app. Ever.
__label__0 Im not saying it's not funny, but it gets really boring. after you go through it once, the jokes get repetitive and i uninstalled it. not recommended.
__label__1 I like it. All you people offended by this app, jeez. As someone said earlier, it's meant for people with a sense of humor. Besides, it said DON'T PRESS THE RED BUTTON. Your fault.
__label__0 I still don't see why there's only one gun, the Desert Eagle. I mean its ok, but there has to be more variation between the choice of guns...
__label__0 Well I thought this would have more to it than what I got. Anything to sell. People will try it.
__label__0 this app is not good it only has one choice for a gun and the gun sounds fake and it doesnt even jerk back as if it has kick don't reccemond
__label__1 It's awesome! Thanks to this, I can kill without ammo! (but I still have to reload). Pow pow pow pow!
__label__0 it's just makes noise, nothing special, kinda sounds like a gun. It goes bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang!
__label__0 despite the other bad reviews, i decided to try it because I really love the concept. still love the concept but it's not responsive to the touch at all which makes it very frustrating and unplayable. By the way, "it's free so don't complain" is not help
__label__0 Ugh, I hate to do this but it's time for me to be one of those FAotD bums and rate this game without even playing it. It looks okay at best but what's with the misspelled name? If you're not going to bother spelling it right then in not going to bother t
__label__1 this is a cute simple game that involves swiping and quick reflexes.The graphics are top notch and the theme is consistent. at least on my phone. I have no idea how this will fare on a tablet. I thought the animation of the monsters flying around was hil
__label__0 After playing this app for 1 min I became extremely bored with it. All you do if flick monsters into the corners of the screen.
__label__0 I would like to give this a higher rating, but its virtually unplayable on my Droid incredible. It often does not read my touch and thus I can't even pass the first level. I've never had an app north read my touch before, so- 1 Star.
__label__1 To off set some of the idiot reviews i will put my two cents in. This app is as advertised, simple matching app. playing or on an EVO 4G, work no problems.
__label__0 Game doesn't work.  Doesn't register most touches.  Crap crap crap crap crap crap crap crap crap crap crap.  Droid Incredible
__label__1 The flicking works great on a tablet.  The reviews about poor touch response makes me think this game was designed with tablets in mind (optimized for tablets), and probably not teted much on phones. I can only review this from my tablet experience, and 
__label__0 for the 5 seat review below please don't insult us. we can clearly see you are the developer..the controls and touch sensitivity is down right uncontrollable. not even worth a free download. Amazon must choose things at random cause clearly no one pre pl
__label__0 This game is simple and might have been entertaining for my 2 year old daughter to learn colors and such but the flick control is just too inconsistent.  Like other reviewers I found it to work only 1/3rd the time making the game unplayable.  Even if the
__label__0 I was hoping this game would install, I'd seen other reviews saying it wasn't optimus compatible - they're right. All I get is a reboot when trying to install.Just wanted to warn fellow optimus users, steer clear of this app.
__label__0 Will not install on LG Optimus! I tried a couple times it just resets my phone. Saw another review about the optimus but figured I'd try no good.
__label__0 I could not get this to work very well on my phone.  It had a very hard time registering swipes (Galaxy S) making it impossible to beat even just the first round of play.
__label__0 a nice idea but the problem is that when u try to tap the monsters they dont always move so u lose the alotted time the game gives u.
__label__1 it is a fun game and deserves at least a 3 from all............i will recommend itGame is HD and controls are fine on my tablet.
__label__1 I'm giving this five stars just because the dev didn't review his or her own app. it has been a nasty trend recently.
__label__0 Agree with the other reviewers - unresponsive controls, couldn't seem to track my swipes, and as far as I could tell no SD support.  Uninstalled.
__label__0 This game is frustrating and the controls are slow and unresponsive. This should be removed until the developer redevelop the game. HTC sensation
__label__1 Graphics are nice. Works real well on my HTC Thunderbolt. Good overall game. Should be 99&cent; when not free though.
__label__0 one of those 5 stars was supposed to be a 1 star, trust me i read it :p  besides that it looks like the dev even rated the game SHAME  i cant offset 2 5 stars but i can do the one
__label__1 i'm giving this game 1 star because from the looks of the pictures of the game it really looks like I could have made a better game why dont you chose the faotd more carefully next time amazon
__label__1 This game is cute, addictive and fun. It'll be fun to play on a short break or while waiting in line. I have had no issues on my Nook; the touch response is just fine. Seems like phones are having problems with this app. Yours might work just fine so it'
__label__0 This game is unplayable at any price. The controls are horrible and it lags and crashes constantly. Also, it is huge for what it is (over 15mb?? sheesh!) which leads me to believe that it is unoptimized and badly programmed. That could explain the insane
__label__0 THE RELEASE DATE FOR THIS GAME WAS 6 MONTHS AGO. THE ONLY REVIEWS FOR IT ARE PUBLISHED TODAY.? WHAT DOES THAT TELL YOU.
__label__0 the idiot voting 5 stars who isn't actually rating the game. good day sir.  I don't like the game.  is this enough
__label__0 This might be fine if this is the type of Sodoku you are looking for, but it wasn't for me.  I only rated it low for that reason.
__label__1 This sudoku app is very easy to use. I love playing it on my Kindle. I would recommend it to anyone wanting to play Sudoku as its got several levels to choose from
__label__0 Just don't like it. better games available. prefer Sudoku's that won't put the wrong # in the space. don't like it.
__label__1 Have just started to play sudoku and this helps you get the hang of it.  Like that I can put in possible numbers.  Would recommend it to beginners.  Have not tries higher levels bt do look forward to them
__label__1 My mom is 77 yrs. young and has watched her children, grandchidren, & great grandchildren use all kinds of tablets & iPads, always asking, &#34;Why are you always on that thing...?&#34;  Well I bought her a Kindle Fire and guess who absolutely loves it..
__label__1 loved it. so cool. fun for all ages. this coming from a 10 year old!? sudoko power.remember get this app!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! :-)
__label__1 Dear Friends,I love Sudoku, and I love this app. Simple and easy to use. Some others are to involved and crowded. This is just a simple, wonderful, and fun app. I use it on my Kindle and it works wonderfully. I highly recommend this app.
__label__1 I love doing these puzzles and I am glad I found one for my kindle. It is easy and fun to do!
__label__1 I'm hooked on Sudoku! Electronic versions are so much easier to play as one does not have to pencil in the possibles, then erase to put in the answers.
__label__1 Within 30 seconds I was watching YouTube videos on my TV controlled by this app on my tablet.  Fascinating.  App found the Xbox automatically no in pouts required.  I am writing this review while app is playing videos on TV.
__label__1 works with both my first gen fire and my fire hd. You don't need to have a facebook account -just skip that step. It works great withm my Sony streaming video box!
__label__1 The Application works great. It found my DLNA enabled Sony Blue Ray player in seconds and I was playing a movie right away.  Definitely worth getting.
__label__0 I PURCHASED THIS HORRENDOUS APP IN JAN. 2013, for kindle fire he. I waited 10 . MINS. FOR THIS STUPID APP TO OPEN UP. NOTHING. TRIED THREE MORE TIMES, STILL NOTHING. IT WILL NOT OPEN UP ON KINDLE FIRE PERIOD. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME.
__label__0 Even with there so called, &#34;updates&#34;, don't waste your time. It has Utube as one of its options, and you can get Utube to work fine with there own &#34;to your TV&#34; link, that are on most Blu-Ray players, to your tablet, so, forget this, unles
__label__0 I don't use facebook so how am I supposed to use this?  No, I don't need and won't sign up for facebook.
__label__1 I enjoyed the flexibility and functionality that this app allowed for. Beams youtube flawlessly from my android phone to my apple tv.
__label__1 I connected this with my Xbox with no problem. I had no problem skipping the Facebook login either. So I don't understand why there are such low ratings. Thanks for a great faotd.
__label__1 I got this when it was free and I haven't gotten the chance to use it yet but it looks pretty cool.
__label__0 I just wanted to tell the developer in a public forum how ridiculous you're app is. I literally laughed out loud when I went into the section with my videos &amp; saw that the 1st 5 vids had the exact same thumbnail nail &amp; then a correct thumbnail wi
__label__0 The description says this app can be used &quot;any time, any place, any screen&quot;  &quot;wherever you happen to be.&quot; Turns out you need a tv that's hooked up to the internet. That's a little misleading, if you ask me.
__label__0 this one is over rated and did not work so well with my kindle fire..better luck next time other devices may work better
__label__1 IMediaShare is a really great app I highly recommend it for anyone who has a smartphone and a HDTV. I do not have a tablet so I do not know if it would be able to connect through. I give this app 5 stars because how easily it can connect with my HDTV fro
__label__1 imediashare is the best app ever!!  I use it on my kindle fire and it works really good on apple TV!  No problems!!!
__label__0 I picked this up when it was the free app of the day.  It is supposed to let you watch your video on your TV without requiring any wiring.  As far as I can tell, it doesn't do anything at all.
__label__0 Lame, lame, lame! &quot;Connect anytime to any tv, no wires needed&quot;... yea only if you have wireless internet, and a compatible tv! This app is virtually useless, specially since 90% of smart phones come preinstalled with dlna software.. BOO, uninst
__label__1 Found my tv easily, pretty easy to use.  Click the video / pic button and the tv auto switches to play it.  Works as advertised.
__label__1 I've tried the free DLNA media streaming applications for android, and have been generally disappointed in them. This one (got as FAoD) is definitely one of the better ones. It was easier to configure and get running than most, and has more features. The
__label__0 I can't stand all this iCrap and that iStuff.  Let's put it away and never use it again, OK?  Thanks!
__label__0 when I got this I was like oh I get to watch my favorite shows.  but I can't play videos on this app.
__label__0 Having used this on a Kindle Fire, I can say it is nearly pointless. I have yet to be able to stream anything to a DLNA TV, whereas an existing Sony SMP-N100 can stream wireless with ease.
__label__1 New Flipps update!!. Everything now works perfect finally!!. You need a new cable tv that shows up on your router "If you want to beam shows to your tv". We just use the Kindle Fire gen1 instead of sending it to the tv of the future that we don't have ye
__label__0 Spinning circle forever.  Connected to internet.  Left it go for an hour.  nothing changed.  deleted and reinstalled.  demo played. back to spinning forever.  deleted forever.
__label__1 I recommend this for everyone!If your looking for a great app to share your videos/music/pics with your tv it's simple and easy with this app!
__label__0 This app contains the Facebook Like Exploit.  It forces you to advertise for the developers who lack the skills or talent to market in traditional ways.  They take advantage of their own customers and exploit their Facebook account.
__label__1 Works incredibly well. No Facebook login needed just press skip. Great picture quality. Does require hardware, smart TV, console or other network connected box.
__label__1 I am able to stream my personal videos to my Tv via my xbox 360. The dev releases frequent updates. The selection of channels to watch is excellent and growing. if you do not have a rokubox or similiar device I highly recommend this. Oh sometimes the new
__label__0 Don't remember having this.one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen to fulfill required number of words.
__label__0 If you have the right devices at home, TV., Media box, video game console, then this would work but if you don't then don't bother.
__label__0 Didn't work with my TV, as it didn't see it.I didn't log into Facebook and I couldn't see internet videos, I couldn't,I see my TV either. This is a paid app, asking me to like it or link it to my Facebook account is wrong.  You should pay me to advertise
__label__1 I have read some of the reviews and i don't understand why some people can't see the option to skip the Facebook login. This app works great with my Galaxy Nexus and Vizio Co-Star Google TV,it would be nice if it was compatible with more Google TV device
__label__0 I was interested in this product to see what it was.  I not sure that I could use this item at this time.
__label__0 I have heard this thing is really hit and miss. If it works on your tv, you will love it. I never got it to work myself.
__label__0 not sure where I got this and I hope I did not pay for it. not sure where I got this and I hope I did not pay for it
__label__1 Really easy to use and connect to my ps3 and watch all the movies in the internet in U-tube or your tablet still have to discover more about of this app but so far really happy with it.
__label__1 Ok, I have had this app for about a month since it was the faotd. It has quickly become my favorite app. My projector at home and the big screen at work both have xbox's hooked up to them so I use this app to watch movies on my phone on those devices. I 
__label__0 I have zero spam (ad networks) on my Nexus 7 and ANY app that installs any of that junk gets removed with a quickness.
__label__0 But it never gets passed the buffering message. I thought it was going smoothly, found movies to watch, and phone photos, but nothing works.
__label__0 I have an android phone with Allshare (samsung galaxy S2) and I have Verizon fios which allows me to access the internet on my tv, but this app still did NOT Work on my tv and I don't know why.  According to the description, this app is supposed to work 
__label__0 It was too difficult to figure out how to make it work. It isn't user friendly at all. Don't want to take the time to figure it out!
__label__1 I must admit, This application is nifty for viewing DLNA shares on your local network either on your tablet or you can push the video to a compatible TV or streaming media devices connected to your TV. But what caught my attention was the ability to view
__label__0 I couldn't even try this app. Tried using it on my Kindle Fire with no good result. It just stays on the loading screen. I have uninstalled and reinstalled but to no avail. If I paid for this I would have been very upset. Purchasing this app should be av
__label__1 This app is a great free app of the day. I can't believe that amazon would offer it free. I think you should get it before it's too late you won't regret it.
__label__0 Great concept, horrible lag and crash issues. I don't suggest paying. Rather you should try the light version and see if it preforms for you.
__label__1 With all the wonderful apps they have, this app is wonderful and is instantly by far the best app that doesn't require to be logged into to view or to share, like other apps. We have had a lot of fun sharing our video's with friends and family. This app 
__label__0 Takes over media playback, makes itself the default. (Very undeservedly self-important!) Just became a total PITA to have on the phone. UNINSTALLED!
__label__0 I didnt' even know that I had purchased or downloaded this app so must not be very useful to me
__label__0 After I ordered it it didn't understand what it was for. It wasn't. Explained that I comprehends it or what it was to be used for
__label__1 All of you whining about this must have missed the Skip button.  I chose to skip the FB login and the application is working fine.  Working well with my Mezzmo dlna server.
__label__0 My phone and tablet already have this functionality that works really good, I don't see the need for an app like this one, also, there are better apps out there that are free. The channels are limited to clips, it sucks, it doesn't have anything good to 
__label__0 Just doesn't work. When I try to use the app it does nothing. I have a Motorola xoom running jelly bean.
__label__0 I got this thankfully for free today as I will explain below why I think this app is way overpriced at $4.99.I am just going to get to the point here.  This app will NOT work with any TVs that don't have any type of Internet connectivity unless you happe
__label__0 I used the original version of this, &#34;iMediaShare&#34; as a DLNA video sender before they changed the name to Flipps HD.  One day I received an update and noticed the name had changed from iMediaShare to Flipps but this wasn't the only change.  Now F
__label__0 This app needs to be taken off the app market, it does not do anything, but not connect to anything useful.  It's something that does not have a function, just takes up space on your memory cards.
__label__1 Google market place. You pretty much need this if you have android. Get it!All the apps, all the games, all the stuff you want.
__label__1 MY tablet came with this app and it was so good that my son had to get it for his tablet also..

__label__0 this app is stupid if I could rate it below a zero I would it doesn't do anything just sits there and follows your finger so if your thinking of getting it DONT
__label__0 this app is not stellar for the kindle fire. it doesn't speak beacause the fire doesn't have a good enough speaker to pick up your voice. I downloaded this app ignoring, the reviews but this app is not for kindle fire.P.S. I love my kindle fire and there

__label__1 Perhaps the Progimax office is located near the editorial offices of &#34;High Times&#34;?  Although I guess they wouldn't be able to program very well all baked.  Still, their apps remind me of my younger, higher, days.
__label__0 sucks, plz don't get this app. totally wrong. no matter what I said, it gave me 87%. plz, plz, plz don't get this app
__label__1 it so super true and I'm so glad i got this game its awesome I hope u get it. by Allison
__label__1 I love this app I mean the boyfriend I had, was nothing like me.Then I bought this app I fir it with my friend and now were dating.I LOVE THIS APP. I mean everyone should find true love, and this app is just a helper.
__label__1 This app is really neat. It is sooo cute. It is different. It is really cool. I highly recommend this app.
__label__0 Sorry but I thought this app was really stupid I mean it is fun and all to see how you and your crush might work out but also its kinda stupid and its not even true about what it says. For me it just took up space in my kindle fire.
__label__0 this app sucks I tried it on my boyfriend it gave us a 10% I mean come on we love each other lots we got really mad don't get this app
__label__0 ...but my device is a little odd (a Nook Color running a version of the Android operating system (CM7)).  The app starts, displays the splash screen, displays "Loading..." and quits.  Rebooted, same behavior.  Oh well, onward and upward.
__label__0 Would love to play as I'm running a fully rooted Nook Tablet 16g Honeycomb. Seams even I can not get past the splash screen it says loading then it reboots..... epic fail for me. I will try at a later date for updates from developer and attempt install a
__label__0 Wow what  a poor excuse for a game. To have this game listed next to pinball arcade is a sin. Glichy and poor physics. Waste of time how this was approved by amazon is beyond me.
__label__0 this app stinks the sound are fake and there are no police fire or ambulance!  don't get this app it stinks!
__label__1 what more can be said download it play it if you don't like it erase it (got to love free things). can't figure out where you would need this lol
__label__1 It sounds just like a real siren! I love it! (I pranked my mom and she went crazy.) THANK YOU FOR THIS APP!!!! :)
__label__0 I will never purchase one of your apps again this app will not let me create a contact delete a contact and u don't even wanna no more don't buy this app gosh very shameful hate this that's 3$ thrown away
__label__0 I usually download the free app everyday, even if it is one I really don't need at the moment.  I refuse to even do that for this app.  I am not spooked by permissions that are needed for 90% of the apps out there but this one scares me.  I realize that 
__label__1 Had iOS on my iPod touch and I've been waiting for an app like this to come out foot Android. There was an app like this on the market called POPtext, which could utilize my Textplus account. But that was crap. I mean the interface was terrible, the load
__label__1 This app is great and works well on my nookcolor. People please review the app itself and not just whether or not it works well for your carrier/data plan. This is a great alternative for people with tablets, iPads, and ipod touches. Doesn't deserve the 
__label__0 This would be a five star app IF it worked properly. I have the new Kindle Fire HD and even though I have it set up in my settings to make a sound when texted it does NOT...I tried all the different sound files they offer. I tried shutting the Kindle com
__label__0 If you have a kindle fire hd and want to make phone calls, like me, do not spend your money. It does exactly the same as the free version would do, even here they make it more complicated.
__label__1 Awesome app, I&apos;m able to txt from my acer iconia tab a500, and a spare htc hd2 using wifi!As for the people that rated this app a low score because they lack the understanding to see how to benefit from having this app, and it was free when they got
__label__1 I rarely have my mobile phone with me, but my tablet is attached to my hip.  Being able to text from my tablet is a huge time and stress saver.  I love this app
__label__0 Can't for the life of me figure out why anyone would need this.  I don't even believe that there was a plan that included data that didn't included unlimited texts at my last two carriers.
__label__1 it would help if u made it app of the day for free please I really want it please can u do that I would love to have it my sister has it and she loves it
__label__1 I recommend you get this app it works great on my Kindle Fire and allows me to text my friends just about anywhere!!! The best part is that its free so you can no longer worry about buying pre-paid minutes
__label__1 This is a fantastic app.  Most of those that are not happy with the app did not read the description of the app carefully.  This app does everything it says it does. And the texts are free! I love it!
__label__1 Let me begin by responding to the negative comments:There may be various reasons why many people would find this application useful. If you have an unlimited text messaging plan on your phone (as most do) great. Don't download and poorly rate the app bec
__label__1 I love the interaction with my contacts on my tablet. My tablet doesn't have cell, but I can text away and get answers when I connect to a network.And support is 5 star.I can think of only 1 improvement: When you enter a number of someone not in your con
__label__1 This app is an absolute must have for tablets.  If you're like me, you've probably been frustrated at the fact your Xoom or other device can't send a simple text message.  Well now you can!  And without having to pay per message fees or for expensive bun
__label__1 the messages pop up of i am not on the app but it is still incredible. dont listen to the bad comments!!!!!!!
__label__1 this is just what i was looking for. i am surprised at the poor ratings by kids whose parents are paying 20 bux a month for unlimited sms. well even for them this is a useful app, here's how: you can use this app using a wifi connection to send free sms 
__label__1 This app is good not great,,  if google voice is better than why give it a negative review when it does the same thing.  Give negative reviews for something thats wrong with it.
__label__1 The app is the best app I have. The only problem is that you can't walkie talky on the kindle fire/ kindle fire HD.
__label__0 Not only is this worthless with unlimited texting but you are giving them access to all your information for all of your contacts AND all of your text messages are stored on their servers.  Just avoid it.  I wish I could remove it from my download list a
__label__0 I thought it was going to let me integrate my own phone number and get my messages on my kindle.  I was mistaken and lost a bit of dough.  I found another app that did what I needed.
__label__1 Some places get no signal but have WiFi available which makes this app great. Or if you have limited text messaging plan.
__label__0 Not free.  Must pay fee to use texting. Sending it back.  No way to get my money back?  Probably not.
__label__0 I have had this app now for some time. now and change my views on it. The free one was SOOOOOOOO much better. WHY? Because with this one I have all these strange numbers that text me in the middle of reading a book are just to much.  Now, I am not sure t
__label__1 This app is perfect! I have a phone, unlimited texting. Buut I do leave my phone in my room and take my kindle fire HD around the house. So I be lazy to get my phone. So I got this app to text on my kindle fire HD lol yes yes I'm lazy. The good thing abo
__label__1 this app in general delivers what it claims however it freezes up at least once a day for hours on end and makes text a pain. you have to force stop uninstall reinstall i regret payin 2.99 for this..i must update my review! ok its ben a month since my fi
__label__1 this app off the chain and it alerted you when you get a text,this is really great on Kindle Fire......get it NOW
__label__0 Ever heard of google voice? More flexibility and free and you can use from your computer and integrate phone service if you are tech savvy. This is just dumb to pay for. Even free it makes no sense.
__label__0 With so many truely free alternatives, why bother with this app? Heck... If you own an app device and don't already have unlimited texting then something is wrong with you. This app just isn't even worth my time.
__label__1 I don't do texting on my phone and always had to email my daughter to her phone.  With this app on my Kindle Fire HDX 8.9, I can text her anytime and she receives it right away.  I don't have to wait for her to text back while playing games or reading a 
__label__1 First off, the app does exactly what it says if you read the description. It says you have to register for an account and you are giving a "texting phone number" right in the description. This is similar to Google Voice except without the voice. Another 
__label__0 I cant for the life of me figure out why there is an app for this... Who has an Android whithout unlimited text? Im on Verizon and have unlimited.  I mean even the small carriers like Cricket and Mobi are unlimited... Amazon, I'm disappointed. Out of all
__label__0 What is a lifeline phone?  It is for someone who *qualifies* to get a free mobile phone from the US government.  Yes, that's right... check out lifeline.gov if you don't believe me.Let's recap where this app is useful:1. If you have never heard of Google
__label__1 I know I know! it does not always pop up the text! but most of the time it does so stop being a baby!
__label__0 I can't easily add or edit contacts. it seems to want to be on a smart phone which in my opinion defeats the whole purpose of me getting this, texting from my Kindle Fire. If I had a smart phone why would I need this? Fairly pointless. It does work thoug
__label__0 I know hate is a strong word but I do not like text plus at all because it felt just being too met I guess
__label__0 I didn't buy this but I saw it a read the description and looked at the pictures. and then I reliezed...his iz this different from the free version. (that I have) They seem exactly the same 2 me.
__label__1 This app is great -- especially when you can't or don't want to pay for unlimited messages! I have friends on AT&amp;T and since they aren't included on my plan, those people use my number for textPlus gold. Then it doesn't use up my allowance for texts 
__label__0 it is tarrible.its a waste of money.does not get pics from people.I just hate it.my mom sent me a pic but I did not get it it not gold its dull
__label__1 I can't afford a phone so I got this and it realy is like a phone. It is realy easy to use and this is the only texting app I have found that doesn't ask for a phone number. :&middot;)Me and my sister both have this app now a lot of my family has this ap
__label__0 I dont have the app, BUT.......Do not waste ur money on this. this is the same app as the original one, except u pay 4 it and u can add voice messages. u don't need voice messages. if u do, then wat is a phone for? The original one is good enough. DO NOT
__label__1 I love this app!when I don't feel like getting my phone I can pick up my Kindle Fire and &quot;boom!&quot; its right there! great idea whoever came up with it!
__label__1 this app does just what it says.  there are zero hidden or misleading information. you have to register(big deal) takes 40 seconds to compete.  you then get your own virtual phone number in which you can text anyone and they can text you back.  they DO N
__label__0 I got this app thinking I could revive pictures and send voice messages.....No! The only way you can do that is if the person you are texting has the app....none of my friends do! Get the free one it is way better!!!! It is a good thing I used amazon coi
__label__0 This may be the worst app ever made.  Lag crashes it has it all. This ago does nothing good for my phone. I have a mesmerize with froyo, my advice is to pass on this app.
__label__1 I love that I get a text on my kindle, android phone and iPod. No matter what I'm using, I can respond immediately. Thanks
__label__1 This app is the best texting app ever! It's amazing on the Kindle fire. I could text anyone! Unlimited texting... AWESOME!!! My family and friends love it! The only thing is, I wish the kindle fire had a mic and camera, so I could take pics and use the w

__label__1 I don't text on my phone at all, but this app helps me to text safely and get info to those I want to keep up with.
__label__1 i just love this app.. now i can use my tablet for sending text messages but the only problem is the notification sound and notification on the notification bar is not working cos gtablet doesnt have a built in text messaging app.. i guess those features
__label__1 I think this is a great app. It texts fine and works great. Ive seen other reviews starring it doesn't work great and isn't that good. It worked great for me and I'm not saying others are wrong. I'm mist starring my opinion and how well this app worked f
__label__1 the only problem is it still force closes. if it didn't force close. I would be much happier with this. and we also want SILVER!
__label__1 This works great on my kindle. I have unlimited text on my phone, and now on my kindle fire too.
__label__1 With the new update, this app just got so much better. Push notifications now work correctly and the application doesn't lag one bit. The speed is incredible. A must have for tablet owners.
__label__1 I use it on my Android device and I have used it close to two months.  It seems to be a good product and I haven't had any issues yet.The only thing I don't like about it is sometimes it says I have to been signed into my Amazon account. This is just an 
__label__1 this is hands down the BEST texting app available! I have SMS on my phone but sometimes when I am parked in my recliner and don't want to get up and get my phone I just text right from my Kindle Fire HDX. Buy this app, you won't be disappointed!
__label__1 I have a kindle fire. I used to have text plus but now with text plus gold it doesn't frees every time I want to get in it. 5 stars!!!!!!!
__label__1 this app is great but I don't see the difference from the free one and paid one? but still, its awesome! go free txting
__label__0 this is a poor application if you are interested in just a sms application and not the rest of the so called features.
__label__1 I recently moved to an area that has ZERO cell service so we got rid of the cell phones and just lived with the home phone but long distance calls were getting expensive so I started looking for other options and skype worked for some of my friends/famil
__label__1 I love being able to text from my Kindle Fire HDX . It's so convenient because I'm almost always on it anyway and it's much easier to text from the Kindle keyboard than on the cell phone. And you can text pictures, too.
__label__0 I bought this thinking it was better than the free version..WRONG. I don't know when people text me. do not get this....its a wast of money....don't even get the free version
__label__1 I love it. It is a great app that lets you be social with all your friends and is totally free. It's a wonderful app and i completely love it
__label__1 I didn't know that I could text on my kindle fire until I was browsing thru the apps. I am very happy with my text +
__label__0 This whole &quot;new number for texting&quot; is silly. Whatsapp is far superior for unlimited texting between smart phones.Even if you get it for free today, you really want to go and bother everyone in your phone book to text you at this number and cal
__label__1 this app is great. especially if all ur friends have texting on their phones and you don't. its cheap (as in cost) , you only have to pay once, and its really nice to talk to family and friends that you don't see enough. I love this app and recommend it 
__label__1 I love this app. I have Kindle Fire 2 gen. I got the pro so I don't have ads. But the free was great too. I am able to text all of my friends and family. As long as I have WiFi I am great :-)
__label__0 thoese ppl w/ the one star reviews are right! its the exact same thing as the free version but u had to pay for it. i think the speaker thing for kindles and tablets would work if u hav headphones w/ a built in mic but its just a ripoff!!
__label__0 it is impossible to call people or do voice notes if it is a kindle fore ur using because it doesnt have a mic!
__label__1 This app is great!! It lets me text people even though I can't use my phone. Yeah I can't receive pictures from people but I don't really care about that. It's free unlimited texting to anyone in the US and Canada and it helps me keep in touch with peopl
__label__1 I do not have Texting on my phone so when I found this APP works great with my Kindle fire HD and I can text using Kindle
__label__1 so you know how people say it crashes? mine crashed for a while too but I found out it was my stupid Internet connection had caused a virus in my kindle fire. if that's not the case with yours then sorry that your missing out on a great texting app.
__label__1 So I heard this is a great app for people who dont have unlimited text messaging. That's great :) I have a question though... do you need a new number or can you keep the one you have in your phone????
__label__0 The number you are supplied with is only a trial number, then you have to pay to have another number. i don't recommend this app.
__label__1 I have and use Text + free on my Samsung Galaxy Tab 7", which by the way has both 3G and WiFi, which is why I got it and not the 10" that is WiFi only.  This review isn't about my Galaxy Tab, or the iPad and its variants.  This review is about an app tha
__label__0 This app is excellent!  Even though there are limitations, it's better than having to pay for texting on your cell phone.  I had the free version, and upgraded to this version to find out what the difference was between the free and the gold (other than 
__label__1 Dudes, (and dudets) this is the best texting app you could get from amazon. I would buy right away. u can text with one person or as many people as u like!  I love text plus and text plus gold. however, it says limited texting on the regular text plus bu
__label__0 I tried both text and text gold. There is no difference in the two, they are both very bad. Hard to use and it does not do anything like it says it will. This is a very bad program, amazon should not sell it to their customers.
__label__1 This has been so handy to text from my Kindle when my phone is otherwise occupied or dead. It has kept me from missing messages when I'm engrossed in something on my Kindle. I have had to reinstall a few times due to glitches or freezing but it always wo
__label__0 This app doesn't connect w/  texting systems. the &quot;phone number&quot; is not real: doesn't connect with other numbers. Not even email-cnctd! (all text systems can connect to email which is an alternative for ipod/xoom users)So what is it? A lame att
__label__0 So can you text without wifi?? and what's the difference between text plus and text plus gold? I have heard its a good app but was wondering if it is better than text plus
__label__1 my parents wont let me have a phone so this is a great way to tale to my friends. I love it
__label__0 I'm really mad. I payed $1.99 to take off ads, cause that's what's different. I tried to receive pictures and I can't. Takes a lot time to load. And always, forces to close and then I have to open it again. You have  limit to how many words you can send.
__label__0 I found out with the appstore update and being logged out that this app only works if you are logged into appstore.  It calls home to authenticate itself.  Not good.  Where else does it call that you do not know
__label__0 Everyone I know has free texting.  This app must be for prepaid phone's. lol Amazon! Today's app is junk, Will pass on this one.
__label__0 This App Says Get Free! Texting But U Have To Pay For Every Text U Write.Give Us Text Now It Should not Just Be For IPods
__label__1 I have the free version of this on my Droid X because my son has an iPod Touch. This let's me text with him since I can't call him on that device. For those with wifi only devices like a tablet this app is a nice alternative. Especially if you don't have
__label__1 I already paid for a data plan on my phone but not a text program. This software saved me money by letting me send texts. Some people are confused by the fact that my phone calls and texts come from different numbers.
__label__1 yea so im 12 &amp; i have a kindle fire but i do not have a cell phone. so i got this app and now i can txt all of my ffriends thank u text plus ppl!!! :)
__label__1 Use it alot buy I wish you got more free minutes to make phone calls when phone is down
__label__0 Google voice is better.  And if Verizon is screwing you over just come to Sprint, unlimited everything for 70 bucks.
__label__0 Has anyone yet twigged to the fact that messages sent via someone else's phone number are no longer yours? That you are giving this app permission to read and store your messages? That an unscrupulous developer could eavesdrop on your messages, and even 
__label__1 Very eadsy to use app. This my main texting app.
__label__0 why would you get this for $ just get the free one the only new thing it does from the free one is voice messages
__label__0 two words: unlimited text messaging. besides there is google voice. this app is just pointless. not to mention that you need a separate number as well.
__label__0 Come on Amazon!! A free texting app? Really? Who is picking these stupid free app of the day??? Do any of you BOTHER to read what people post?? Why not pick an app WE'D like to be free?!? And for you... XOOM owners... the Galaxy Tab can text...ha ha ha h

__label__0 on the pics and stuff it shows u can revive pics and call people but that's not true its just like he first one!!!!
__label__0 one of the worst free for the day apps yet. even if you don't have unlimited texts, don't bother with this. you'll eventually be charged and it has the ability to read info you send out. doesn't sound very safe to me.unlimited text plans are pretty cheap
__label__1 I have two people I text on a regular basis.  TWO.  I do not like cell phones, because I'm a student and I seem to always forget to put the dang thing on vibrate while in class.  When a cell phone rings while you are in class, it is Not A Good Thing.  I

__label__0 there isn't anything you can do with it. the lighter one you see/toy with fire and can flip the lid but this is kind of sad.

__label__0 i dont understand why this app is in the top 100 because most of the apps there are actually good but NOT THIS ONE! ehat is even the point of it. uninstall if you have it and dont buy it waste of time
__label__0 This game SUCKS! I mean what is the purpose all you do is press a button. And when I said for it to be pink it was still WHITE!!  DO NOT GET THIS DUMB GAME!! MOVE ON AND HAVE A REAL PURPOSE IN LIFE.
__label__0 the resen I vote this a 1 because it dusint work on a kindlefire but good on the andrord and ifhone
__label__0 ok I absolutely am addicted or.obbseses which ever you prefer to lighter apps I think they are the best invention since sliced bread I always want to use that saying but this is.such a let down it.made me so mad that I shined this app and are warning all
__label__0 when I got this app I thought I would get an app that has a picture of an lighter then make a flame but instead I got an app that makes the front of my tablet white. this app is a price of crap!!!!!!!!!!
__label__0 this is a peice of poop its crap if I could I would rate it 0 stars but I have to I don't even what it is ment to be for
__label__0 I have the kindle and all this does is make a light and sound never ever get this app it is worthless
__label__0 all you do is push a button and then it makes a dumb sound.it is the most retarded thing I downloaded.
__label__1 I tell my daughter that if she wants to play on the tablet she needs to do learning games. So I downloaded this and some other money counting apps and some apps to help her tell time. This was a big hit with her. The graphics are great and they have a fe
__label__1 I got this for my 7 year old who is learning money in 2nd grade.  She loved it.  Really helped her to understand the concepts and what the coins really looked like (better than the copy of a worksheet at school).
__label__1 We enjoy using this program, especially the sorting sequence of *coin. We must use a pencil/paper to help with the calculating of coin total, but this really adds to the teaching that, &#34;Money equals/is Numbers&#34;. I am using this with my autistic s
__label__1 I fine this app to be most useful when looking for good deals every day. Try it and tell someone what you think.
__label__1 I have had AARP for about six years and I use it got a lot of things. I use it when I travel and save money on hotels, meals and car rentals. I also have their roadside assistance plan and it is much cheaper than AAA.
__label__1 just what I have been looking for and use it daily. I have been a member since I turned 50.
__label__1 I have all the aarp information at my finger tips. I love being able access topics on my kindle when I think of them.
__label__0 Downloaded app, tried to log-in, got log-in error said I was not a member. Sent email to app support, got a reply email that was a lot of legalese mumbo jumbo. Got mad and deleted.
__label__1 love all the info I receive from the app. keeping up with the current things out there for our age people is nice.
__label__1 Ok AARP where is the Kindle Fire version.i side loaded this app into the Kindle Fire and it worksgreat.
__label__0 tells me i am not an aarp member; i am. closes suddenly, all the time, randomly, without warning, loses data. junk. uninstalled. dont want it. ViewSonic gTablet.
__label__0 Unfamiliar site, difficult to maneuver! There is no sign-in available to associate directly to your account, check your preferences, or change profile.
__label__0 I am not sure why this app does not work on my Kindle Fire when the AARP Magazine and Bulletin both work fine, but I was very disappointed.  It downloaded fine but I could not get it to open.  I kept getting the message that I needed to be connected to t
__label__0 Downloaded and installed with no problem on my kindle fire. Tried to sign in and was told I was not a member. If this is not corrected this is a worthless app. Uninstalled.
__label__0 This is one of worst apps ever. Will not recognize me as a member. It should not be offered to anyone.
__label__0 This APP is a bummer, it's a lemon, it's no good! Tried several times to get into my account but kept saying I am not an AARP member. I noticed some other reviewers said the same thing. Even tried removing & downloading it again. No good. If there was a 
__label__1 If you are an AARP member and on the go then download this app. I was even able to show my AARP card to any retailer who recognizes the power behind its' membership. AAARP always seems to get it right! Kudos!
__label__0 This app has given me nothing but grief. If just freezes my cell phone. There is no loading beyond the login button. It works fine up to the login button. Avoid this one folks there's gotta be a better one coming.And tell em' you've read another review b
__label__0 kindle fireconstant force close when trying to register, happens when trying to enter birth datefix it it's of no use to me
__label__0 App not helpful for me the sugestiond it gives doesn't really jelp me. If they give more infoaybe it might be better.
__label__0 this app does nothing on the kindle fire you just look at the animals but when you touch the animal it make a noise but is stupid stupid stupid and did I mention it was stupid so I would not recommend it at all not even the tinest bit and do you know I b
__label__1 fun and good for my twins Cindy and Chris. They just started preschool and now they are learning to read.
__label__0 don't get this.game u cant even pet the dogs so the names a waist . DO NOT GET NO NO NO NO! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
__label__0 don't get this game!!!!!!!!!!! its BAD like lame bad!!!idf u want one u cane really pet go on the Internet and look up foo pets. com no spaces like this foopets.com
__label__0 This game stinks! It doesn't do anything GOOD! I say don't get this, when you tap on the animal you just touch it and it meows or something like that! Frustrating to ME when I bought it, I thought, this looks funny. But noooo it HAD to be stupid like I t
__label__0 it does not do anything but say the animals name the only one that makes a sound is the kitten but not all the time. don't download
__label__0 I had gotten this app for my one year old cousin, and you touch the screen and most of the time it does nothing. Little picture options and does not keep my cousin busy. It also freezes. I reccomend not getting it!
__label__1 I WAS TOTALLY SURPRISED WHEN MY GRANDDAUGHTER TOLD ME ABOUT THE FREE GAMES OFFERED TO THE KINDLE FIRE WE PURCHASED. THEY LOVE PLAYING THEM, AND THE PET THEM ANIMAL EDITION RE-ENFORCES THEIR DESIRE FOR A PUPPY. THEIR CAT LOOKED SURPRISINGLY LIKE THE ONE O
__label__0 this game is really really really lame all u do is pet stupid animals I am only 11 and I think this worst app evr
__label__1 Aww these baby animals are so cute I'm glad I get to PER them because how would you feel in a world without pets
__label__0 I thought you would get to pet the animals and they would react!! Well they don't. They are just pictures of animals that you touch and they make a noise! DO NOT GET THIS APP!s
__label__0 Ads and more ads. The animals did nothing when you touched the screen. Even the smallest grandkids were NOT entertained, but were more annoyed than anything.
__label__0 I thought you could interact with the anamals but it only makes 1 sound every minute. I think you shouldn't get this app. It was a huge disappoint.
__label__0 who would waste their time stroking fake pets.its a waste of time.you could do much better things with your time.DO NOT GET THIS APP!!!
__label__0 this game is crap I thought it would be like fish adventure or birdland but no it sucks don't purchase it.it sucks believe me
__label__0 I thought that it would be ok even though everyone else said it sucked but it really does suck I couldn't even make the animals do anything not even make a noise!!! I recommend you don't get it!!!
__label__0 it only gives you a picture of a bear and you pet the bear it does not do any thing.Its just a dumb picture.
__label__1 I love puppies so when I found this game I was so happy to see that they had my kinds of pets
__label__0 This app is dumb. Its stupid. only shows pictures of ten animals.I would only recommend it for kindle owners with 2 year old kids, NOT adult or teenage people.
__label__0 I have a cat that is much more fun to pet than this app. stupid stupid STUPID! don't download. I'M WARNING YOU! READ THE REVIEW! DOWNLOAD AND YOU SHALL BE CURSED! BWAHHAHAHAHAHA!
__label__0 Jeez you have to agree to something of course I didn't read it cuz I'm lazy but still it came harm your divice.I don't think this is the best app.
__label__0 what the f*** is this for nobody will like it not even baby's like u stare at cute pics. while like they make a sound oh wow big deal
__label__0 it is so stupid all their is is pictures and words and it doesn't even make any sound. it is the worst game ever! I hate it. you cant even pet the animal.
__label__0 my daughter was sad. nothing to do at all. we erased it in 10 seconds. what a shame...could of beenfun
__label__0 it just a pic of an animal and it doesn't work somebody just wanted to have an app andget known for how bad it sucks!
__label__1 Very good. Great pictures of baby animals. Fun for any animal lover,any age. And its FREE! What a deal and great app!
__label__0 how do u even do this game wft is this u got to flip over cards i got the game but dot even play the dump game this for  slow people
__label__0 this is so stupid u click on the name and a voice just says it its just pic of cute furry baby animals!!  Such a rip off!!!!!
__label__0 this is the worst game in the world. navery get this game because you will reaget it .bealve me I now.
__label__0 okay,im not quite sure what to do with this app,i got it for my brother, but when you touch the animals nothing happens, not even a noise,so im confused.
__label__1 it's a nice game but i think it would be better on a tablet. with the screen size on my og droid it makes it hard to drive the fish around.
__label__1 The controls are just fine and this is a fun game for a while.  The adventure mode can be beat in an hour or two but it is certainly worth downloading.
__label__1 I got this app not exactly knowing what it was but became quite addicted to it, and its as simple as it sounds grow your fish!!, it's a simple game but still maintains a good level of challangehd2- android
__label__1 I have been waiting so long for a game like this. Survival of the fittest. Eat anything smaller than you. Get eaten by bigger creatures. Grow! Eat the bigger guys who messed with you before. It's a simple and fun concept. Spore uses it. Darwin's island m
__label__1 A great time passer.  Haven't been playing it long, but - so far - it is a cute game. Try it
__label__1 This is very similar to a Popcap game I really enjoyed on the PC, Feeding Frenzy. The more little fish you eat, the bigger you get. The bigger you get, the bigger fish you can eat.
__label__1 Great game seems dull at first, but gets better. Lots of levels with a shop to purchase upgrades. This game seems stupid at first because of the levels where they teach you how to play. Hang in there and you'll like it!
__label__0 Graphics are ok, sounds are ok.  But game was too simple so I stopped playing after just a few minutes.  When I closed the game, the sounds continued to play.  Started game again and used task manager to kill it.  Game closed, but sounds continued still.
__label__1 Great adventure game. It's awesome, fun, and time-eating. I recommend this game for anyone looking for something that requires good strategy or that has a slight challenge to it while not being too difficult. Overall I love it and would pay up to $7 for 
__label__1 I don't like 'endless' type games so I'm very glad this has levels. The menu is slightly pixelated and cheap looking, but the game is excellent. Cute and colorful,good sounds and nice controls. I prefer the joystick control but it's nice to have a choice
__label__1 I downloaded this as the FAOTD and it reminded me of a game called Osmosis I got as the FAOTD as well.  I loved that game and the fish game was quite similar but a little easier to understand since it was easy to tell bad fish rather than bad cells.
__label__1 Fun game, many levels and two different difficulties. Its addictive, I have beat the game once and am going back to play them all on Advanced.
__label__1 The &quot;most helpful reviews&quot; for this game are not helpful at all. If you read only that, you will never give a chance to the this little lovely game. It is a very good game , similar to the famous game named &quot;Helium&quot;, which I uninstall
__label__1 While the game itself is fun and cute. Most of it is used to save money and then build up your self confidence to play survival mode. And endlessly fun throw your phone at the wall and play it again kind of fun.
__label__0 Games like this have been around for a long time and, having played several versions myself, I find the effort and quality of this game rather lacking. There are many free games like this online that are much more fun.
__label__1 The goal is to eat fish smaller than yourself without being eaten along the way.  A very cute game that gradually increases in difficulty.  My 4 year old enjoys playing the easier levels and I like the more challenging ones.  I like how you can upgrade y
__label__0 Ad free?  Meh- not really .. never mind that you really can't even play this game without buying add ons. I get the premise of selling more powers in games, everyone has to make a buck but this game equates to nothing except swimming a fish around to eat
__label__1 Got this game and can't stop playing.  Fun fun fun, beat part is competing for the highest score in the online leader board.
__label__0 Had to delete it due to its lameness. Could possibly be fun for others who don't find simple things entertaining.
__label__1 This is game is simple to understand and does not need a long tutorial to figure out. Its best aspect is the desire for improvement, meaning the player always wants a bigger and faster fish. The game has an variety of powerups the player can use to catch
__label__1 simple fun power ups perfect graphics enjoyable gameplay for a good game it'll take half your battery and that's after 10 levels. happy fun.
__label__0 Have not heard of this & don't recall downloading.Did you know Amazon does this bait & switch sort of think with the discounts for applying for an Amazon card?
__label__1 This game kept me occupied for a long time. Wish there were more levels.Great game which advances through levels with a chance to set your personal performance.
__label__1 This game is fun, esp when bored and you don't want to think too much. I enjoy the different fish you have to conquer or run from.
__label__1 I was all set to hate this game based on other user reviews and when i played it... i found it fun and entertaining. I dislike joystick games so having to tilt my kindle fire isn't a problem for me like for other users. You eat other fish and earn coins 
__label__0 holy crap what a terrible game. talk about trying to ride the coattails of angry birds. the leveling system is a rip off of birds. and this game is so boring.
__label__1 While I didn't pay for the app, I got it via Blackmart/4shared, it was a great game. The adventure mode provides a real challenge, with great replay value. definitely a must!
__label__0 all you do is swim around and eat little fish, a waste of two dollars. do not buy this app!
__label__1 Over the years I've seen them add and take away different stuff, but the game is always fun and challenging. Addicting too!
__label__0 Remember back when you could go to a store and buy a computer game? They had many levels...you could play them for days...now we only get offered Apps...little peices of games filled with adds. spyware and malware. And if they dont...well wait around til
__label__0 This game is NOT free (or going to be free) of ads/IAPs. If you remember their other recent FaotD (missile defenders), that game also had no IAPs and no ads for the FaotD promotion. Now, it has both ads and IAPs.Not only this, but about 2 weeks ago I che
__label__1 it an easy past time game that is callmig. you dont have to touch your screen. you tilt your device. fun. family approved (i think that anyway).
__label__1 At first, this games controls annoyed me until I turned on the on-screen controls instead of the lame finger leader controls that  are default.  Now, this game rivals angry birds to me.  Switch your controls and give it a try.  HTC G2
__label__1 This is one of the better editing program for android. It works well and is easy to learn if your a novice.. If you previously had photo editing programs it's a cinch to master. It covers most of the retouching components.
__label__0 This is exactly what I need.  Sadly, I only learned that it won't work on my enTourage Pocket Edge AFTER I shelled out cash for it.  Running Android 2.2.1.  Wouldn't install.  (Can I have my two bucks back?)
__label__1 This app makes the tablet worth while. Just being able to resize, rotate, and color correct on the "very mobile" is GREAT! In any emergency you can clean up a shot and have it ready for whatever your need. This is an invaluable tool, and I can't beleive 
__label__1 This app lets you put apps into groups so that when you are looking for something you dont have to scan threw the 200 apps on your phone. This is a great app.
__label__0 This really does put labels on your apps.  It really does gather them into labeled files.  That is, it does that for the apps it feels like listing -- and it persistently left out a good half of mine.  Undoing everything and starting from the beginning s
__label__1 Absolutely required on my Gingerbread device which has no native folder app and even on ICS this blows the doors off the native foldering. Customizable folders with customizable icons makes the difference to this user.
__label__1 This app is extremely easy to set us and use making it easier to find the apps I need without having  to scroll through all of them looking for a particular one.
__label__1 Really like as it works as I expected. Hove to play just alittle to find all the options
__label__1 It works well and it's ad-free.  I use this app nearly every time I use my tablet.  I see the author has only one other app and it's a paid app that I don't need.  I wish he would develop more apps, even if they were paid; I think he has done good work a
__label__1 Everyone should have this one! Organized apps are a must have on any device and this one does the job.
__label__1 This app is very easy to use to organize you apps in one place so you can have them on your home screens.  I like being able to categorize my apps and have them in one icon like games, e-mail apps etc...
__label__1 I have been using this program for several months now on a variety of different Android platforms, and it has always worked.  The app is simple to use and the price (free) is wonderful.
__label__0 I didn't like the set up on it. still looking for an app organizer...just want something simple...that I can manage myself
__label__0 this stinks! not worth my time! I mean seriously pushing buttons the whole time. please stop making terrible apps! I'm begging you! its torture!  don't get this!!!!! thank goodness it was free!  I mean it.my rating.  :  (
__label__0 this game is extremely confusing and extremely frustrating !!! this app totally sucks don't waist your time and get a better app this one sucks
__label__1 I played this. it has realistic fight sounds and awesome graphics. I recommends you to get it. :) Ps.. it is awesome
__label__0 My son wanted this app, it looked ok, so I let him download it. All it is is noises that sound like hitting or punching someone. Nothing else. Frankly, we have enough violence in the world without apps that sound like violent acts. I deleted it from my d
__label__1 I REALLY LIKE THIS SITE IT REALLY KEEP ME POSTED ABOUT PEOPLE ON THIS SITE AND I WOULD TELL OTHERS ABOUT THIS SITE!
__label__1 I love it. So easy to use! On my Kindle Fire. Clear pictures &amp; can say hello on the run and get quick updates.
__label__1 CARING BRIDGE IS AN EXCELLENT WAY FOR ALL OF US TO STAY CURRENT REGARDING THE HEALTH STATUS OF A FRIEND OR RELATIVE.
__label__1 for not letting us lose touch with our friends going through with health problems..this is a great product! Use it and hopefully your friends won't have to use it during a health problem.
__label__1 great program for keeping track of my friends illness and staying in touch with him.  I am very happy with app
__label__1 I joined this website a couple of years ago when a friend of mine had cancer.  It is a great way to stay informed about the health of a friend or loved one when you don't get to see or talk to them everyday.  I was excited to find an app for it .  It is 
__label__1 CaringBridge is a wonderful place to post status updates on someone in the hospital, hospice, or struggling with issues.  It is easy to use and to administer.  Having the app on my Kindle was a big help while someone I cared about was struggling.
__label__0 Every time I try to open it on my kindle fire it ALWAYS force closes. Other than that I like the app.
__label__0 All this is, is a bunch of links to youtube videos, most of which have been taken down, because the uploads them selves violated Fox's copyright. I can hardly believe this app is actually allowed in the marketplace. It's actually getting you to pay for i
__label__0 once i got it for $.99, i got banned from YouTube pretty much right after i got it. So i had to delete the app and i wasted $.99 on it. But, wen i had it and i wasnt banned from YouTube,  i found this app very disapointing. dont waste ur time and money o
__label__0 Using this app to get to Glee videos will not work because the user has been banned from Youtube. Do not waste your money.
__label__0 I didn't read all the reviews and its ranked 88 in the top paid  apps I bought it and called amazon because I don't get ripped off and just talk about it so the problem has been reported and I'm confident in amazon company to keep anyone else from gettin
__label__1 i was on the fence on buying this app because of the other review and i am happy i did you just have to rember the only people who put out reviews are the people who don't like it. p.s. hope i helped u
__label__0 when I was trying to buy this app I wouldn't work don't waste your money on this app. its not worth spending it. I hope its on Ipod. I bet its better on there than it is on kindle fire. don't waste your money on this. you should read my review first.
__label__0 Reviewers should write to the app developers to fix the bugs on this app. Don't buy app. sorry DUDU Apps.
__label__1 I don't acctualy have the app but I love glee. so I might try the game out. I LOVE GLEE!
__label__0 game is ok when works, but it won't run for long.  loads slow, crashes every time you load it past level 7. uninstalled. m Droid.
__label__1 don't know what the other reviewer is on about. works wonderfully well on the 3.1 xoom tablet. the game itself has some well thought out controls which are different. require some fine timing moves. some might say controls require luck but I feel its mor
__label__0 On my Thunderbolt this program freezes my phone while trying to load Feint every time. when I shut it down it goes into an endless loop of force closes.This isn't the first time games with Feint have given me trouble. Needs to be fixed.
__label__0 Most games run great on my 10&quot; g tablet, but not this one.I always find it odd that developers spend months creating a new app but then don't take a few days at the end to thoroughly test it.  No doubt the game itself would work fine but then at the
__label__0 Got it as the free app of the day. Installs just fine, but crashes upon startup. Unable to actually play on the LG Optimus.
__label__0 Too bad.  It sounded like a truly innovative and fun game.  Like another guy, it just exits to the launcher after the &quot;loading&quot; screen on OG Droid.  It would be awesome if this is a bug that will be fixed rather than this being yet another game
__label__0 I get the splash screen and then it closes. does not work on my Moto droid A855. Glad I didn't pay for it.
__label__1 Well, after reading all the poor reviews I was really hesitant. After all I don't have a brand new phone (Nexus One) and Gingerbread is still hit or miss with some applications, but I'm very glad I gave a it a chance. For starters - the game installs its
__label__1 Great game. I enjoyed it a lot. nice concept. I wonder why the same apps/games that have 4.5 - 5 rating in Android market (which they deserve) always have 2-3 rating in the Amazon market.
__label__1 Similar play style as Blast Monkey, but much cuter and more fun. The physics-based attraction of the Nano Pandas makes for some unique puzzles. I enjoy it a lot. My one complaint is the menu buttons occasionally take several presses to work.
__label__1 I had the free version from Google Market, and love that it's an Amazon free app of the day (though i'd be happy to pay for it). The gameplay is fun and challenging. Runs well on my phone, and works great on my tablet. On tablet, the graphics are optimiz
__label__0 Extremely slow to start, then crashes often. I never got past the first level and gave up because of all the crashes and the amount of time to do anything. I can't review the play of the game because I never got to actually play it.
__label__1 very cute. challenging yet easy enough to be fun. Good App!I'm not sure what others complain about. if it doesn't work maybe it's your phone.
__label__1 Mind the people who don't know how to wait 5 more minutes for the free app to get registered as free, even past midnight. Amazon takes a bit of time for the free app of the day to actually show as free when you "purchase it."This is a great game, and it 
__label__1 Great looking and works perfectly on galaxy tab. Very polished like Angry Birds, fun gameplay too, but hard to use any skill, its magnets, maybe as get farther i'll pick up more on the patterns of the magnetism.
__label__0 Displays first screen but is completely unresponsive. Total fail on Asus Transformer with Android 3.1. Devs, please try actually running it on honeycomb before releasing for tablets.
__label__1 This is nearly as good and challenging as Angry Birds.  It takes a little bit to get used to how these flying pandas work.  Basically the attract each other and there are these laughing atom things that you are trying to fling the pandas in to.  It is re
__label__1 I cant stand the people that review a game low because it does not work on their phone. I think you may need a new phone! The app works great on my optimus and the game itself is fun and cute! Its definitely worth the $1 purchase.
__label__0 FCed when I tried to load it. May be a great game, but I can't find out on my Nexus One.
__label__0 WARNING!!! DON'T DOWNLOAD!!!  CRASHES LIKE CRAZY!!!The initial load was very long, even before Open Feint kicked in.  After that it was a 15 second wait until the menu music began to play.  One on the menu, I tapped Achievements to look at the achievemen
__label__0 So I figured people must have been exaggerating or had old phones, but no, this app just sucks. On my brand new Revolution it tried to load for almost a minute before going to a black screen and not responding. Could be a great game, bit I'll never know.
__label__1 Very original concept. Launching two pandas at different times can send each in a variety of directions. Enough levels for it to gradually become harder.
__label__0 This game doesn't work well at all on a Droid X. The game installs and operates very slow and seems to crash often. Uninstalled.
__label__0 Slow, boring game. Force closed many times. Once, didn't even start at all. Pass, even if free. Space too valuable.&euro;&euro;&euro;&euro;&euro;&euro;&euro;  adopt a shelter pet.  &euro;&euro;&euro;&euro;&euro;&euro;&euro;&euro;
__label__1 Fun game! Worked well for me- nexus One, Android 2.3.  Did have issues with Feint, but patience win the day.
__label__0 loads to main menu then FC! i am running 3.1 on ASUS Transformer Tablet. looks like a fun game though
__label__0 I never got to play this game because of Fient. it locked up while loading on my nexus s. if it can't run on pure Google what can it run on?I refuse to download any game running fient. it causes feezes, force closes, etc. no developer should use it.
__label__1 Figuring out the solution to each level is very fun. The objective and scoring are very straight forward (unlike Angry Birds) which means striving for a perfect score each level is actually enjoyable and skill-based not luck-based.
__label__0 Crashes and force closes instantly on T-Mobile G2. Seems like an interesting game though. Wish it worked. Will update score when it works.
__label__0 UnInstalled after a few attempts at second level. How do you even play this game?!?? Cool graphics but can't get very far.  Wouldn't recommend. Droid X.
__label__0 Motorola Droid.  Never gets past the loading screen.  How can you release an app not tested on a Droid?  Remove from market or insert incompatibility report.
__label__0 Like the title says, app won't install. It downloads just fine, but won't complete the install. First time I've ever had this problem.
__label__1 I love this book and reading it to my students.  Now, that I have a young son, I also enjoy reading it to him.  This app makes the book come alive for both of us and I myself thoroughly enjoy the sound effects.
__label__1 This is a fun book for children just learning to read. It bolsters confidence in reading and it is Dr Seuss!
__label__1 I love these books. I enjoy reading it to my son even if he is a little grow up now.
__label__1 works as it should, great little app. pictures are clear. sound is great on my phone and my nook color
__label__1 This app was bought for my granddaughter and she loves it it reads the book to her so she can take it all around the house
__label__1 My 3 year old daughter loves to play with Mr. Brown Can Moo and all of the Dr. Seuss book apps.  She loves how it both reads to her and she can click on either the words or pictures to have them said out loud.  A great learning app.
__label__1 The kids loved this.  It was wonderful to be able to sit down with them and get them involved.  They enjoyed the touch screen noises and when it read to them.  They also were able to read together which was nice.  I would recommend this and the other boo
__label__1 I totally love this, wow talk about keeping your mind quick this keeps me on my toes I know when I am having a hard day or a day that I have greater clarity. This is a great mental workout.
__label__0 I downloaded this game to my KF HD today, thinking this would be a great time killer. However, downloading Touch the Numbers ended up being a time WASTER! The game continually stopped responding on the opening screen where I input my name. I tried uninst
__label__1 This game is so much fun. The object is to hit the numbers in numerical order and try and get a better your score each time you play a new game.
__label__1 This website is awesome! I recommend it to anyone! I have started talking to a guy on eharmony and have met up with him already. we are planning on meeting again and I hope it eventually turns into a relationship!
__label__1 With this app I can access my eHarmony account from almost anywhere if my Kinddle is within range of a Wi-Fi signal. It is very convenient. I think many eHarmony users would enjoy this app.
__label__1 I've never had any problems whatsoever!I was able to complete entire profile, questionnaire, uploading of photos and browse my matches.  I would definitely recommend to friends & family...Great App! :-)
__label__1 i don't even need to log onto my computer to access e harmony anymore. Everything you need is on this app
__label__1 Every morning when I read my devotionals I end up by reading a few of these quotes to get my day started. They have a nice background that I wish more things I read had because it is pleasing to the eyes.

__label__1 I love having the quotes on my Kindle Fire, there to read anytime I want....can't go wrong getting this app.  Awesome!
__label__0 it is so bad  i cant even describe how bad it is it repeats it doesn't let you favorite it is bad spelling and puncuation. don't get this app
__label__1 this game great but has no directions so here they are1. tap to pause.  2. swipe to change direction 3. can go through the walls.
__label__1 I have so much fun with this game. Since I grew up with a Nokia cell phone I played this game for hours when I was a teen.
__label__1 This app is a lot of fun. I love snake. This is the best snake game I hva found. I highly recommend this app. You should get this app.

__label__1 wonderful app. no hassles. takes you strate to the game so u can get rite to playing.. i like it
__label__0 This app runs very, very clunky. Even though it was free, it wasn't worth the time to download and even play once. Boring.
__label__0 I was so dang confused!!!!!! It doesnt even make any sense!!!! I would Not recommend This app. It sucks butt.
__label__1 This game will engage you for hours! It definitely gets tricky. Game is user friendly on the Kindle Fire and I have found no glitches thus far. The game was free so I am extremely happy with the purchase!
__label__0 My 7-year-old is so fat he only plays his kindle fire he never wants to go outside with me he's always playing this game.
__label__1 I love this game! It's totally awesome. I play the classic snake game on the computer and wanted it for my kindle fire. I picked the right one. This is so much better than the other snake game and free too. I like being able to set different speeds and l
__label__1 I use this on my cell phone and ipad. It works great because it is fast on 3g as well as WiFi. If I could replace the default browser with this one and save the memory I would do so in a heartbeat!
__label__1 Absolutely a must for me and I recommend to everyone. This makes browsing on the phone so much more efficient. The Dolphin Browser HD is also wonderful, if you have a phone with decent resources.
__label__1 love the create your own gestures feature. tabbed browsing and easy cookie and cache cleaning helps it to work very well on tablets. clean & simple to use. highly recommended!
__label__1 i love this browser its fast and full featured.  i really wanted to like the firefox browser better as i love firefox on my desktop.  however its slower and more akward than dolphin...
__label__1 Instead of going into a lot of detail, let me just say I use this every time I go onto the internet with my cell.  In the window of this browser I have AOL, Google, Facebook, my bank, Walmart, and more.  All I have to do is click on the Dolphin icon on m
__label__0 Doesn't work with kindle hd. Uninstalled it. Still trying to find a kindle browser that I like. I like streaming internet radio directly from the station websites, not using I heart radio or pandora.
__label__0 I have  downloaded and tried several browsers. I'm looking for a browser that supports the Adobe Flash I have on my tablet. I heard good things about this one so I tried it. It starts to load the URL then stops about halfway. I tried refreshing, I tried 
__label__1 Much faster than the supplied browser on my phone. Has easy features to learn and is reliable. Well worth the low cost.
__label__1 I've had this for months now on my Thunderbolt.  After trying several different browser apps,  I found this one.  It works perfectly!  Quick,  searches Google in a flash,  is easy to read,  add bookmarks,  exit,  and just plain use in general.  I will ha
__label__1 I got tired of fighting with the default browser on the Thrive. I looked around and based on reviews decided to give Dolphin Browser Mini a try. It has not had any of the problems of the Thrive browser. I recommend it with no hesitations.
__label__1 I got an LG Thrive, which for a cheaper Android, is pretty decent, but the stock browser on it is terrible. It would load about 75% of the way and just hang on every other page you attempted to go to. I thought it was the wifi and I was on the edge singl
__label__1 The Dolphin Browser Mini (or its big brother, Dolphin Browser HD, which is not available from the Amazon App Store but is available from other sources) is a "must have" if only because it can identify itself as a Desktop browser instead of a mobile brows
__label__1 This app is by far the best free app I have downloaded. It has improved my phone's browser ten fold. so many features. all around 10 star app.  thank you
__label__1 I should say I have the HD version, and I sideloaded it onto my Kindle Fire. It works great though, makes a great upgrade to the vanilla amazon browser that comes with the Kindle. Even better, it supports flash so I can watch stuff like youtube on my kin
__label__1 Tried every browser. Even alpha tested some. This one takes the cake. Wish they could add some stuff, but it would take away from the simplicity and beauty in the design. Simple and fast for a great browser.Update: The update looks great!
__label__1 If only they had dolphin for the desktop!  This browser is efficient, very fast, and doesn't spend a lot of time updating tracking databases. Browsing speed increased by a factor of 5 over the default chrome browser on my phone.  This browser has worked 
__label__1 I originally got this for my Kindle Fire HD and worked great.  I got this for my android smart phone a works just as good.
__label__0 This is a very good browser and better than the default Android browser.New Update.I've been using Dolphin Mini browser for a few months now and I no longer like it.Most of the links that I use on websites will not open up in this browser.I also have tro
__label__1 Took a second to figure how it works, and that you fill in the info. on the right and read the results on the left, but... cripes!... this thing converts EVERYTHING and does it easily.
__label__1 I love this package.  I use it to convert British pounds to Euros to American dollars.  I also use it quite a lot to convert measurements (dry and wet) so I can convert grams to troy ounces to pennyweights.  Most helpful tool.  My husband and I watch som
__label__1 I purchased this app on the app store for my Kindle Fire. I could not be happier with the usefullness of this product and so far have had absolutely no problems with using this app. It is very intuitive.
__label__1 I like this app.  I am always looking for a conversion factor for metric to imperial measurements whether it is kilometers or millimeters.
__label__1 This is a handy app for making all kings of conversions.  If you need to go to from metric to standard this is useful.
__label__1 Great conversions. You can convert measurement into almost any other measurement. Covers a wide range of measurements. I use it frequently.
__label__1 This program has every unit conversion you could imagine. I don't use some of them, but it lets you customize the units that you use and don't have to scroll through units you don't use or even understand what they do. Great free program.
__label__1 There are conversions in here I did not know existed. I originally purchased it for a quick currency converter (works great, especially if you update the currency rates frequently...done by clicking the &#34;update currency&#34; button).I have used it fo
__label__1 This Unit Converter is very complete, having every category I could even conceivably need and all of the standard units, including some obscure ones I never heard of before. This installed and runs perfectly on myKindle Fire, Full Color 7" Multi-touch Di
__label__1 This is a very handy app I use it quite often and highly recommend it if you need to do conversions on weight, area, volume, angles, Etc Etc
__label__1 If you do any sort of engineering work of any kind,this app beats the stuffing out of your calculator. Don't need to do no key sequences.etc. Wow...very nicely done. The list of conversion categories is just staggering.
__label__1 I find this app very useful.  The set-up has many category selections, within that, there are units, and then value.  I didn't know there is a difference in a US cup and a metric cup - I thought a cup was a cup!  So, not only do I get the information I t
__label__0 I purchased and installed this app on my kindle fire and it seemed to work just fine the first time, but after that first run all it does now is cause the screen to flash and then returns home.  I uninstalled it a few minutes later.
__label__1 Item one great buy I love it , I use all the time.it a must keep app.I use at the office ,home and with  school work.
__label__1 Nifty little program to do simple converting. I do recommend this program for simple everyday use at home or in the store.
__label__1 i downloaded this to my Kindle Fire and i use this all the time. it works great. No Complaints at all
__label__1 I have seen many of these types of programs especially for Windows. Most were a febel attempt to make a in depth program. How come it took Android opperating system to get something this in depth onto the market. I have an engineering degree in electroni
__label__1 I was looking for a free currency converter, when I came across this one. works like a champ and the choices to pick from are amazing.  hard to believe it is free! love it.
__label__1 No matter how many times I tried to convert a niumber to a fraction, I always had to ask someone else for the formula. Not anymore, this works each time, everytime! What a great app.
__label__1 I was looking for a metric converter but found more than that. I don't know what some of the categories are, but it's good to have.  Too bad I didn't have something even close to this in high school or college.  Remember that?  When we had to do everythi
__label__1 I use many of these conversions on a daily basis.  Great app.  Interface is not immediately intuitive but once you realize how the app is set up finding conversions is extremely easy.
__label__1 I give this app very high marks for the flexible way that you can choose your favoite categories of measurement and make it even easier than the way it comes with all of the areas selected.  It is quick, easy to understand and best of all it's FREE!
__label__1 This is great because you just enter one unit of measurement, such as an inch and it converts it to about 40 other units which can be easily scrolled through to find the one you want.
__label__1 First let me say that I am NOT a rocket scientist and some of the functions on this I not only do not NEED, I don't even know what they are!!  Hubby is an engineer and he was very impressed with this app too.  You can also have the exchange rate set up o
__label__0 Enytime I try to go on it just quits me out. Its a good app but it only lets you use it twice
__label__1 I don't use this Ap often although when I need to do a conversion it is GREAT! I've used it for dimensions, weather and more.
__label__1 This application has been very useful for me in many instances. No matter what I'm looking to convert from or to, this application has it!
__label__1 What a great app!  It makes all type of conversions and calculations easy as pie to do.  This app takes all the guesswork out of any conversion calculation.
__label__1 Well I was looking for a free converter for medical calculations and every day stuff I got more than I expected and have covertions for things I never have to do I think. But fun to try them out. Perfect for those inquiring minds
__label__1 This is a universal converter.  You specify a value, and it gives you the conversions in an easy to understand format.  You enter a value in miles, for example, and it gives you the conversion in kilometer, inches, feet, etc.Highly recommended.  And it i
__label__1 This app has been useful in all situations. I use it for school, vacations, track and field,  and everday use as well. It is current and up-to-date. Has all types of units from all countries including biblical units. Does currency, weight, mass, yada yad
__label__1 Always needing to convert something and this is a great tool!! Another 5 stars!! Thanks and Works great!! So helpful
__label__1 ConvertPad - Unit Converter can't be beat. It converts every possible thing that can be measured, even currency! This is the kind of app I would expect to pay 2 or 3 dollars for, yet its free for the taking. It's a must have in my Kindle Fire tool kit. M
__label__1 I use this app all the time. It converts everything I need. I have it on both my Kindle Fire and my Driod Razr Maxx and use the app on both all the time. It converts so many different types of measurement such as sound, ring size, prefixes, illumination,
__label__1 This app looks and works great. Thank you to the developers. This really helps me with work tasks. Very much appreciated.
__label__1 This is a very versetile calculator for your device that has all of the basic, and some advance, functions that you would ever need to do saome math. It is also great at conversions from metric to american and visa versa.
__label__1 I really like the conversions on the Unit Converter which readily converts items into Metric plus dollars into euros and other helpful conversions.
__label__1 This app has far outreached my expectations, to a fault if anything. It has many many different types of measurements.
__label__0 ConvertPad has proven useful, except for making temperature conversion between F and C. So far I have not been able to find a way of entering a negative temperature.
__label__1 I have had this app on my Androi phones (present and past).  It is indespensible.  I am a scientist cannot remember all this stuff but it is all here.  It even has a currency converter which updates.  Even has a place to store your own special conversion
__label__1 Simple layout works just as it should. This app is extremely helpful now when I need to convert anything, I no longer have to do a search for a conversion calculator as this one does it all and its free.
__label__1 This is a good all around app that does everything, conversion-wise.  Have used it many times...mostly for dollar to whatever, and for tips.
__label__1 The book &#34;Life at the Extremes&#34; (on my Kindle Fire) has the temperatures in Celcius only. With this app on my cellphone, I get an instant conversion to Fahrenheit. Easy to use, too.
__label__1 I downloaded this for my Android phone and now I have it on my Kindle Fire.  I can't think of a unit conversion I would need that this app doesn't have.  For free too!!!
__label__1 I have tried about 4 or 5 other conversion apps, and none were satisfactory.  This app does it all, quickly and easily, and does more conversion types than any of the others.  As far as I am concerned this is the one you should try first.
__label__1 This app let's you convert between different measurement systems quickly and easily. It's very handy for carpentry and mechanical work.
__label__1 This app has everything one could ever need.  I had two converters on my phone before.  Now only one.  Thank you.
__label__1 VERY EASY AND HANDY SINCE I MAKE ORDERS FROM OTHER COUNTRIES AND LIKE TO KNOW THE EXACT AND CURRENT RATE OF EXCHANGE.
__label__1 I've had to use it to convert lengths and fluid volumes. It's a very handy tool. For example, the fuel additive I bought recommended adding an amount in ounces, but the measurement marks on the package were in milliliters.  I used ConvertPad to solve the
__label__1 Had this on my smartphone first for several years and then put it on my kindle HD when I got it.  Great converter, though the way it is set up is a little bust and there is a learning curve in trying to figure out how to use it.  You can do just about an
__label__1 I have been using this app on my cell phone for years. Just added it to my kindle fire. One of my all time favorite apps.
__label__1 Love this app.  I frequently need to convert from cm to inches, or from Centigrade to farenheit (or back).  It will covert just about anything.
__label__1 If your phone/tablet can play Warheads this COULD be the one to show friends what your Android device can do.This version has almost everything from the old Atari classic Missile Command and enhances it with beautiful 3D graphics and animation effects. O
__label__1 This is basically Missile Command, but with updated graphics.  Great graphics, great pace, great sound effects.  This is one of the few old school games that manages to keep its appeal even in such a faithful recreation.  Awesome.
__label__1 Very cool game, faithful to missile command, good music just wish there was ambient war sounds in the background to give it a good effect and i can't really hear the missiles firing and explosions, but all in all props to the developer, good job, but ple
__label__1 this is a fun addictive game. It lags a bit but that can be fixed in the settings. blah blah blah, get it.
__label__1 Good graphics, well built game. Very repetitive gameplay, but hey with a premise like this what would you expect? Nice sound, too.
__label__0 I'm tried of of being asked to post my scores, playtime and other information to feint,  so when I see the leaves,  it gets one star.
__label__1 This is by far the best missile defense game I've played since the original missile commmand came out. The graphics look good, the effects are great, and the action moves fast. I can see how the particle effects may slow down some lower end machines. But
__label__1 This game is a killer blend of old and new school technologies, and I love seeing the classics come to the Android platform.  5 stars!  Droid incredible.
__label__0 Two things in order for me to want this.  Get higher resolution screen shots. These are horrible. Gives you the idea that graphics suck. And ditch feint, I don't want to post scores and hate being asked every time. At least put an option to turn off fein
__label__1 This game is simply amazing. The music is epic, the visuals are amazing and the game play is what you'd expect from a missile defense game.Definitely give it a try! You won't be disappointed.
__label__1 Fun missile defense game.  Graphics are great.  Did not expect it to look this good.The key to long term survival is to not waste ammo and don't lose bases.
__label__1 I was a little hesitant to d/l this game w/its huge file size since my phone doesn't have a lot of internal memory to play with but I was relieved to see that all but 760kb went onto my SD card.  :D  I think the graphics are just wonderful and, contrary 
__label__0 The gameplay is the same as old missile defense games of yore. The graphics are pretty good,  and while the screen shake effect seems kind of cool it wears thin pretty fast. Voicee overs also become annoying pretty fast,  perhaps if there was more variet
__label__0 are you kidding!? this has to be the most dull game ever! no friggin joke... dont bother wasting your time hoping that it gets better like i did ... haha
__label__1 Good app, very challenging game play.  It is a little laggy on my Galaxy S, but I am sure some of the newer phones would have absolutely no problem.  Would be nice if you could lower the graphics significantly.  I had to uninstall because it would not pl
__label__0 Worked on my other phone and was very nice, too bad it crashes as soon as it starts on HTC ONE X
__label__1 This is a great game its not hard and its not boring and its allot of fun.its alwjays fun to beat your high score
__label__1 You should get this game its a great time waster. Its can't get hard after level 20. Give this game a 5 ratings.
__label__0 Not a bad concept, but it has got to be the most annoying game ever. No way to turn the sound off, and the volume control button does nothing when the game is open. And the options in the settings menu are impossible to switch. Gameplay isnt bad, but I c
__label__1 I enjoy game remakes that are faithful to the original.  Well done.  This is a fun game.  How many characters do you need?
__label__1 So I read the description and as soon as I saw the words missile defense I was like great this is gonna be a missile command rip off. Well that's exactly what this is and its fantastic. I hated the original missile command but this game looks beautiful a
__label__1 This game is actually quite challenging once you dive into it. On top of that it's a completely new concept of shooting your own missiles to block missiles. Collateral damage, cool graphics, and smooth game play are all nice on my samsung galaxy s vibran
__label__1 I have to admit that this makes my phone smell like poop but I really don't mind. I am going to like it, poop or no poop.
__label__1 hey! Pay Atten!  this is not Missle Command Classic!  This Warhead game is like Missle Command.. BUT.. it's come with 360 degree defense!!  i love this game!!  realism missle attack and ground shake... so real game!!  i m giving this game 5 stars!!T mobi
__label__1 Wow! An amazing remake of the classic 80's arcade. Amazing graphics and sound effects make the game 10 times more enjoyable than the original.
__label__1 I just downloaded the app and played ten waves.  This is a good missile defense app.  The graphics look great on my Samsung Vibrant.  There are a lot of missiles raining down on your four different sectors so you have to stay sharp.  Nice addition to the
__label__1 I still haven't gotten bored of it and I have had it for thee months.How can you get bored of this
__label__0 My Daughter says she isn't impressed with this app, she says in her opinion it lagged out to much.  She says you could only do so much in one day.
__label__0 Galaxy Vibrant (TMobile). Was super excited to create my own zombie pet (Benesaizombie) but couldn't even get it to load. Took four attempts to uninstall! Wants to retrieve other app info. Remember it is always a bad idea to store passwords and other sen
__label__0 I'm keen come on purplepenguin can u do any better with it this game sucks. so bad I just I cant even begin
__label__1 this game is the BEST game ever in the world and people do not know wat they are talking about
__label__1 is the most awesome game in the history of history! I love love love love love love loved the game
__label__1 It was WORTH EVERY PENNY;) Lol. in all seriousness, if you are bored its a nice thing to play once a month, and it has great graphics, but then again, I could stare at a wall for 5 hours and not get hired, so maybe that is simply me.
__label__0 This app was not fun at all. I was thinking something like Nintendogs, but with a fun twist, but completely wrong. I played it for ten minutes and was completely bored. I gave it another undeserving ten minutes of play and noticed nothing was going to ha
__label__0 if I could lower the rating on this game I would. there is no point in this app. play for about 10 seconds and you'll see. If you are looking at this app, you're wasting your time.
__label__0 it's a simple 3d model with few actions. they added a poor leveling system wherein you gain expeience and levels by going through a few of the model's pre-programed actions. i'm sure it was quite a bit of work for one guy(or girl), but this isnt a game.
__label__1 I love this game and my mom. said I'm to young to have this gamesoyeahmymomissortameansoyeahokward
__label__0 I don't no if I should get this app is it good or is it bad.please tell me I need to no now
__label__0 What a horrible scam it is the worst game ever if you want a fun zombie game or atleast something you can laugh at play memes vs. zombies. This game SUKS N00BS!!!!
__label__0 Terrible graphics along with confusing gameplay.  This game made me want to throw my whole tablet away.  Do NOT even try this game!
__label__0 so I get this app thinking it would be like zombie life but more graphic. boy was I wrong all u do is press a button to watch a zombie jump up and down, or another one to make it eat ( which is just him doing had mottions into his mouth). the people who 
__label__0 this game is soooo w and i've seen games like it. i would NOT recemend this to friends or family. it needs more stuff than feed and run.
__label__0 holy crap that's kreepy when I shod my cuz he ran away and hit the wall ha ha classical and had be take to the dang docter cruse u game!
__label__0 totally not worth it at all. graphics are lame. got boring very fast.  not at all what I had expected.  all you do is beat it up and watch it move very dumbly
__label__0 I did not get it if u hate it like I do I recommend block story minecraft etc.but wat do I know I'm just a nine year old...
__label__1 I'm a person and I think peaple are lame so ya don't call apps lame this one is great creators you did a good job but come out with a my pet zombie 1,2,3 I bet they will be great.
__label__0 so boring I fell asleep litilary I mean ur just watching the zombie do stuff I thought it would be cool but I thought wrong do not get it and I do no regimens this to a friend
__label__0 this game is so lame and boring I truly don't recomend it for any one I wish I read the reviews. first
__label__0 one of the worst games I have ever played. waste time. If I could give it no stars I would.
__label__0 Very few things to do and you only press buttons. Played for a minute then quit. Boring!!!!!!!!!!!!! Waste of a download.
__label__1 I love it its a good game of u really like zombies right frank uhuhuhuhuhuhuh well got to go I'm chilling with my zombie say bye frank uhuhuhuh
__label__0 Too bad. I would have liked to have tried this game. It just says &quot;Loading...&quot; but never does anything else. I even set my kindle down and went to lunch. When I came back it was still the same.
__label__1 this is the game where there is nothing to say about sceptically for it is the awesomest game I downloaded
__label__0 I was hoping for a cool zombie game. it is a really cool idea but this game does not really live up to it. very little options. hope someone expands on this idea.
__label__0 I have used this app for ages because I usually fly on AA.However, there is now a version 3.5.1 for this app, and I can find no way to get the updated version on Kindle Fire.Therefore I can no longer use this app on my Kindle.Hopefully Amazon will resolv
__label__1 Kindle Fire User:  I am so glad that I stopped trying to get the Flightview app to work and got the American Airlines app instead. I have access to my entire account right there so I can be assured that the information is the most current and is correct.
__label__1 I find this very handy as I use a AA vard and travel as much as I can with AA . They call with update the day you are flying so that help to arrange the proper time to travel time to airports.
__label__1 Due to weather several of my flights were delayed and the AA program was easy to access and get my updated information.  It also gave me connecting gate information before I even got off the first plane to the connecting flight.  Very helpful!
__label__1 allows us to check on the flights that we are taking with AA and be sent notifications of their departure. Can check in on the phone...we will see how well this works when we are in St Maarten
__label__1 Before retiring I flew more than 100,000 miles a year and never left the United States.  This little ap was my most used software while travelling.  Don't leave home without it.
__label__1 I really do like being able to review my flight arrangements and view my options for all of my travel needs.
__label__1 I got this when I booked travel on American Airlines, and it is easy to navigate and use. No issues to report.
__label__0 Downloaded and installed just fine. Tried to log in and got a pop up window that said not supported, upgrade app to use.Well that would all well and dandy, but not place have I found to get an update.
__label__0 I havn't had a chance to use it. I am not a globe trotter, but at first glance, the rates didn't seem attractive.
__label__1 Gives me more flexibility when sitting in an airport which is all too frequent these days. Now we need an App for reserving overhead bin space.
__label__1 Very easy to use. It is actually better than Flight Status. It also show you the flight route map in real-time (maybe a little bit delayed)
__label__1 Use it all the time! We check flights daily and this is one of the few we trust. The best!
__label__1 I had use it various times. it works well and it is easy. It is very close to real time. very accurate so far. I had no problems with it. I can monitor my trips and my guests trips.
__label__1 i got this app while i was on a flight to California using inflight WIFI. I needed to know what gate my connecting flight was and if i had enough time to make my connection. I downloaded this app and not only did it show me the connecting information i a
__label__1 I purchased this app -- the free version is great but the paid version gives you the flight times.Hopefully they'll update it with more options in the future.  If you do purchase the app pleaselist your requests/wishes in your feedback. Hopefully they'll
__label__1 I get a more accuate time, without going back and forth to the ticket counter. You don't have to wait in long lines to ask a question.
__label__0 Kindle Fire User: I tried this app and was happy with it for a couple of days. Then, out of nowhere, it started changing my flights to "past" status even though they are months in the future. I refreshed constantly and it didn't help at all. ALSO THE ADD
__label__1 I use this to track flights my family and I take from florida, to michigan anf to florida, as well as other vacation trips.
__label__1 I LOVE this!  I work at LAX and this has been one of the best things I've ever come across.  This totally eliminates the need to either call the airlines or run from terminal to terminal to check on a flight.  This also works great when you have code-sha
__label__1 This app. is an excellent one. I use it constantly while flying because it provides more up to date information about my flights than the airline app.
__label__1 This is a must for every air traveler.  It shows every flight between two airports!  When you're stuck or when you're planning it is a real help.
__label__0 this didn't work on my k/fire.  I wanted to track a flight from London and it wouldn't show me it's location.  I then booted up the lap  top to there website and it worked great conclusion app is not as good at least for int'l flight.. Price is right!!
__label__1 Great device for tracking flights on your tablet.  I have similar products on my PC and phone and this one works just as well as both other versions.
__label__1 Very easy to use app, which tells me just what I want to know...whether to arrive at the airport early or put off the trip for a while, when picking up my frequent travelers. It shows the progress of the flight along the route, which is fun to see, updat
__label__1 excellent and easy to use.
__label__1 This is perfect.  Beats waiting outside an airport for a plane that has been delayed because of weather or some other reason.
__label__1 I use this app whenever I'm flying or someone I know is flying overseas to be able to tell exactly when they have landed for airport pickup. This app is very detailed and accurate.
__label__1 This is a nice app, and it doesn't appear to be stripped down or crippled as many free apps are. I used it yesterday to track my wife's flight from Atlanta, Georgia to Austin, Texas. I entered some other flights just to check out the app, and it really w
__label__1 Easy to enter flights and a nice clear layout. Very up to date information. My gate changed and I knew about it almost instantly.
__label__1 I have used this app to flight-follow a family member's trips, and I really like the departure and arrival information about the flights.  And a bonus is the airborne flight-following feature.  Not only is it great to know that someone has departed or ar
__label__1 So easy to use and you get the map of the flying route.  Works for all airlines.  Even tells you type of plane, how high they are flying, and how much actual flying time left.
__label__0 i dont even remember using this i deleted it so fast it must have been totally worthless. but it was free so try yourself
__label__1 I've used this app on my iPhone for a long time. Very precise and accurate. I like knowing when the plane lands. Where the airline websites only tell you when the plane arrives at the gate.
__label__1 My favorite!!!
__label__1 This app works great and the best part of it that it is free
__label__1 Must have app if you or a love one do a lot of flying or going on trips and then some.
__label__1 As a former private pilot, I found this progarm outstanding.  It provides me with more then necessary information I need to plan my flight.  I highly recommend this program.  One need not be a pilot to use this.
__label__1 Super tool to track flights. Works on domestic and international flights. If you call the airport they will give you minimum info. With this app. you will know where the. Flight is and you can plan your pick up better. For me a definate keeper.
__label__1 Have you ever wondered just where in their flight your loved one was when flying to a destination?  This is an easy to use app that shows exactly the place in the sky the plane is traveling.  Times are given so you can judge when to leave for the airport
__label__1 Love to use this to tack flights anytime anywhere. Even if you don't know the flight number or even airlines you can find a flight you are looking for.
__label__1 This app keeps me informed of  flights that I am  going to be on or  flights family members are goingto be on, I love it
__label__1 Hey I love this app.  You can track your flights on your kindle.  When you have a few layovers it is very handy.  I felt quite smart using this app.  During the cold winter months, when there are massive cancelations... this thing is just a &#34;must hav
__label__1 I was recently traveling in bad weather so my flight times were constantly being changed.  This app let me see the changes before we were ever notified by the airline.
__label__1 Great resource and very easy to use.Good app and would recommend other flyers add it to their electronic resources.
__label__1 Boy is this a handy app to track flights.  Really easy to use - love the map interface - strongly recommended to anybody who ever picks up anybody at the airport!
__label__1 Whenever people fly out to see us I can track their flight all the way across the world. The nicest thing is you know whether there going to arrive early or late. Saves a lot of waiting time at the airport.
__label__1 No more wondering if the flight has arrived while waiting in the cellphone lot. It lets you know in real time. A very useful app if you fly a lot or offer to pick up friends and family at the airport. Used to have to hunt for this info on my laptop at ho
__label__1 This app is quick and easy to find a flight, see the stats on the flight and where the plane is at the moment.
__label__0 I Have 15 seconds for level 1 that's just stupid I haven't past level 1 yet and the reveiws that said it sucked they were right don't ever get this game! its slow  on  kindle fire too.
__label__0 this is a terrible game never get it. it is slow and it times you to try to get a goal it doesn't let you okay to a certain score. don't get it.
__label__0 this game speed is very very slow. I cannot tell what is happening it is very confusing. I do not reccomend this game at all.
__label__0 after 10 seconds I deleted it. it got so boring so fast. it was also really laggy on my kindle.
__label__0 I didn't like it what so ever it was slow and it seemed to freeze it isn't very good on kindle fire not recommended for anyone
__label__1 This game is fun. I don't play too many games and this one was exactly what I expectedGood graphics
__label__0 this app is pretty stupid, you'll know what I'm talking about when ur deleting it. this is definatly one the the worst app on the market. but its free.
__label__1 if it says ur not touching the screen u can change the sentitvity of the touch. this is a fun game and works if u know.Wat's good
__label__1 AS I SAID BEFORE, MY GRANDCHILDREN ARE AS HOOKED TO AMAZON.COM AS I AM. THE HOCKEY LITE IS A GAME I DIDN'T KNOW THEY HAD. I'LL BE SURE TO LET THEM SHOW ME HOW IT WORKS. THE OTHER GAMES ARE BEING PLAYED REGULARLY, SO I'M SURE THIS ONE IS TOO. BEING FREE I
__label__0 this was not my fav app and it was really slow ecspecially with the kindle fire so if you have one do not get this app it was BORING!!!!!!!!! :(
__label__0 do not bother geting this they have faster free air hockey apps don't get this lags on my kindle fire
__label__1 I played this game for a short while and determined it's a keeper.  I have always enjoyed air hockey and when I found this game, I had to have it.  Happy with it, lots of fun and takes a bit of focus and strategy to win.  :)
__label__0 this app has a unbeleivable amount of lag on my kindle fire, I removed it within 10 seconds. what ever u do don't download it
__label__0 I wuz playing wit my friend and we couldn't even play it Cu's it kept saying we weren't touching the friggin thing. if I could rate this a lower number it wunderkind b -342578975432097654332112335667990087655443322113445_55667788887$#!* u autocorrect!!!!
__label__1 I didn't get it for no reason. . .  . .. . n n. . . . . . . n .
__label__1 The 2-player mode works excellent on my gTab, there are not many free 2-player air hockey games and this ne works exactly as expected.
__label__0 All I have to say about it is that its dumb, stuipid, and a huge rip off!!!!!!!!! Just don't buy it!!!!!!!!
__label__1 I dont care if u guys like it or not its ur own oppinion so shut ur mouth about it and.just pretend u love it ok that would be good ok u can say something bad about it but only in ur head ok is that ok with u yes or no people I need to know so think fast
__label__0 This game is the worst game ever! It looked fun but its not! Don't get this app! Take my word for it.
__label__1 love it huh hm u nh h u tc g y Bhutan ty g buy. Gb. by buggy Gb g g
__label__0 Much like the other reviews I found this app to be slow and problematic on the Kindle Fire. The developer needs to rethink this app's design as its not release ready.
__label__0 this app sucks if you have a fire it cant tell if I'm touching the screen or not and its very slow. don't waste your time I deleted it right away.
__label__0 It does not matter what device you have. It only gives you 20 sec. to play the first ****in' level!
__label__1 The most amazing technology since the phone!!!It's incredible how you don't even have to touch devices just your hands and the tranfer takes place because of the vibrations in the cloud!!! Wow!
__label__1 Works on Android and iPhones.  Essential app for sharing contact details or other information between phones.  Oh, and it is free.
__label__1 This app is a great way to share apps, pictures and contact information.  I didn't realize that pictures were compressed to send MMS and end up being lower quality on the receiving phone until a friend told me and told me to use Bump and it wouldn't do t
__label__0 wanted to share some pics from my phone to my Samsung tablet. It asked for GPS even though they are on the same wifi network.  Then it wouldn't work.  It asks for a heck of a lot of permissions considering I just wanted to share a pic with myself.  Unins
__label__1 I actually purchased this product, and it performed as described.  However I have since deleted because I found that I did not use the product and didn't want it to take up space in my smart phone.
__label__1 If I could give this app 10 starts I would.  It works very good although it does not get all the garage sale listings from Craigslist, it does get most of them.  The paid version is well worth it because it will give you voice directions.  The graphics a
__label__0 At the time I installed this on my Kindle Fire HD, it started up really slow and lagged alot. Not very useful.
__label__0 This didn't give me any information that I could use. Maybe because I have the Kindle. No GPS. It's probably a fine product in an android or gps contained device, but not for me.
__label__1 We recently moved to a rural area in Maryland and are about equi-distant from three (3) Craigs List areas.  People list in all three.  There are numerous small towns and communities and it is very time consuming to search all three lists for all the smal
__label__0 If this app is free, why am I being asked for a payment method? I'd like to try it if it's free!
__label__1 This App is very helpful in my business.  There are many things a business needs and this is definitely one.
__label__1 I absolutely love this app!! I sell Thirty-One products, and it's so easy to plug in the info to get a broken-down total. I highly recommend this to anyone in direct sales or with their own business!!
__label__1 As a new Independent MK Consultant, this really helps me figure out how much to charge my clients and customers for delivery, adding tax to subtotals, and add which percentage I need to get paid for my time. Very convenient, there is also an ad-free edit
__label__0 Once I installed this app on my TF Prime, I noticed these green + in my notification bar. It was spam, I have never seen that much or that kind before. I talked to my nerd friend & he gave me a link to an article about it.&lt;...>I installed the recommen

__label__1 This is a simple bubble popper game, but with very nice graphics. I've always liked games like this, and this one is very well done, and addictive. It is fun to see the bubbles flex as they drop and slide over.
__label__0 Impossible to play this game of you are colorblind. Wonder why they would discriminate like this against colorblind people. Would have been able to rate better if I could actually enjoy the game.
__label__1 This is a nice easy little game but a lot of fun. Can get addicting and the bonus games a funny sometimes.
__label__1 quit crying if your colorblind! that has nothing to do with the gameplay if you are unable to see the game uninstall it you nitwits! like a blind man complaining about the color of a rose!
__label__0 Close to one of twelve males are colorblind; this game is unplayable for them (me). Many (most?) similar games have the option of using colorblind mode -- symbols or textures in addition to colors -- or a gray scale mode. At the very least, have it play 
__label__1 thanks app develop, this game is very fun and has awesome graphics. it feels as if im floating among the clouds with all the bubbles popping and cloud like effects. i think its a very well wrote game and is fun yet to boot.. thanks for everything u have 
__label__1 installed this game and it froze my phone vibrant 4g during gameplay. after a reboot it has been running great. the graphics and sounds are pretty decent love that it can load to the sd card as well. sorry for all the colorblind people out there but stil
__label__0 for many years the internet has advicated the senseless slaughter of bubbles. these small creatures have done nothing but amuse children and bring adults mindless fun when someone farts in the pool! we must take a stand against this injustice of bubbles.
__label__0 What about a color blind mode?There is no way that a color blind person can play this game.Don't waste your money if you are color blind.
__label__0 played on my new Acer a500 tablet where I pop it does not register but somewhere near by. and of course not full screen on a 10.1 tablet
__label__1 I've played other bubble popping games but this is the prettiest.Downloaded it right when it &quot;popped&quot; up as the free app of the day. The bonus game between rounds is something new.Sammy Fascinate
__label__1 This game works perfectly on nook color. It is full screen and calibrated. Runs smoothly and does not freeze. A great game.
__label__1 Don't know what other people's problem is cuz I have a Droid x &amp; it worked flawlessly for me. You tap 2 or more of the same color bubbles to pop them. It makes a fun popping sound that I find awesome for whatever reason. It's a good, simple time wast
__label__1 This game is a simple game that is well thought out. It involes poping bubbles which is pretty easy. Some levels have a transitional mini game within them to avoid getting popped out.The music did not get annoying. The colors weren't that great. I would 
__label__1 This is probably my favorite game. I try others but always come back to this again. Has never frozen my epic.
__label__1 Downloaded this hoping it was a lot like the game on my old Windows phone.  Turns out this is WAY better.  Great gameplay, graphics and sounds.  Works great on the gTab.  Free or paid, it is a great game.
__label__0 Only would get a black screen every time i tried to open the app. Several attempts  made then uninstalled. Driod X
__label__0 downloaded just fine. every time i try to open the gane to play it my screen goes black.I'm glad it was free. it looked pretty cool.  does not work on stock EVO 4G.
__label__1 this game runs flawlessly on my droid 2. it's cute. the graphics are just cute,and the soundtrack is calming. sound effects made me giggle. i like it. ;-D
__label__0 No surprise this one made it to FAD considering how worthless it is. just another puzzle popper game clone like the millions out there. Only difference is you paid $2.99 for this. Hey, at least it's free for today.
__label__1 Anyone who loved PuyoPuyo will definitely love this game. The concept is fairly simple: pop 2 or more adjacent bubbles to pop them. Calculate how to best pop the bubbles to clear all bubbles off the level. The classic mode is NOT timed, so it is easy to 
__label__1 Great graphics, addictive play, and fun sound effects. I gave it a shot when it was the free-app-of-the-day here, and was surprised and pleased by how solid and entertaining ity turned out to be! Check it out!
__label__1 thanks Amazon for this loverly game today. this game is bubble burst, that game that used to come with all phones, but cuter.  I figured it'll b great for my two year old but didn't want to download since it said not compatible with all tablets.  but aft
__label__1 If you are into butterflies then is app is for you, it is so real like I could not believe it
__label__0 application never opened so it's kinda hard to rate it.  i don't quite understand why it didn't open but you may wanna look into it
__label__0 cant get it to load or work on my phone. Anything else I have gotten worked but this one doesn't.
__label__0 I can't even open the app so I really can't rate it. The pic is pretty on the outside though
__label__0 I uninstalled this one. It just flat out didn't work for the tablet. I think this one may be made for a phone sized screen.
__label__1 Beautiful! Not too much to say about this, the photo is self explanatory. We both love butterflies so this seemed like a nice background.
__label__0 I don't like it doesn't fit the screen both ways when you move tablet from long to tall and it is kinda boring of most screen savers I have already deleted it.
__label__0 DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS! IT IS A HORRIBLE WASTE OF TIME. NOT WHAT YOU WANT TRUST ME I KNOW THIS
__label__1 Looks sweet on my Samsung Galaxy 4.0 MP3 player.  You can change the size of the wallpaper and speed. My skin on the player is shades of pink so this is a great compliment.
__label__1 This game is a lot of fun, I like the journey mode. Great if, like me, no one you know is willing to go up against you in parcheesi.
__label__1 You will really like this game. It is easy to play. Very close to the board game. You will get hooked
__label__1 great game. works good with kindle fire. have had no problems. I like all the opitions you have. can choose how many you want to play against.
__label__1 If you like the game trouble...then you will love this game...it is just like it and lots of fun to play...I like that I can make it 2 player and play the computer &#34;AL&#34; and he doesn't cheat either...nice game to play when you want some quite time
__label__0 I didn't like how this game was set up and was a little confusing at first. I got bored very easily
__label__0 I have played many forms of this game, but this game app here was very confusing to me. I played a few times to give it a fair shot, but because of the confusion, I lost interest very fast and deleted it the same day I downloaded it. I personally would n
__label__0 Playing on Samsung note 2. The rules are not the Parcheesi I'm familiar with. Single die so no doubles. Throw a 6 to start, not 5 and sometimes rolling a 6 would get another turn, sometimes not. The final straw, and what I gave it 1 star for- had to rest
__label__1 This game is very addictive.  I use to play this online everyday and would sit for hours play and chatting with friends.  Highly recommend it!!!!
__label__1 If you remember that game as a youngster and liked it you'll love this app. Warning, playing against 3 computer opponents is time consuming. Graphics are just average but game play is accurate to the old style board game. I recommend this app.
__label__1 Like the game, it keeps me going and a good game to play when I can't sleep at night, though I sometimes lose track of time & it's daylight!
__label__1 This app is just like the games I used to play as a kid.  Lots of fun and has new additions that make some spaces different with safe and roll again.
__label__1 I had a lot of with this game. Super fun if you like board games. It is a great time waster. Works great on Kindle Fire.
__label__1 A lot like aggravation with a few twist. Trust me, I have felt like throwing my kindle out the window a few times. My favorite games are Aggravation and Sorry and this game gives me a little taste of both. NOW if someone would do Spite and Malice,  I wou
__label__1 I like this app for Kindle Fire.  I was looking for something just like this.  I used to play this game in Windows 3.1.  The old Sierra Hoyle games were bright and colorful.  This is my new replacement.  Also has AI and can play against 1 computer compon
__label__1 I got this game a while back and it reminds me of the board game Trouble! It's a fun game and easy to play. I enjoy it when I'm up at night feeding my newborn because I don't have to think much when I'm half asleep :P Definitely recommend it for anyone w
__label__1 Awesome app. Easy to navigate. Transfers are easy. You can view all accounts. I had questions on one of my accounts and sent an email. It was answered within an hour!
__label__1 I mainly downloaded this app to make it easier for me to pay my disocer bill every month.  This app certainly does that flawlesly.  No complaints so far.
__label__1 I love this app.  So much faster and easier!  I also love my Kindle Fire as it does all I need to do....

__label__1 when i need it my information is available and it is safe. quick free and easy way of doing  things without my computer in hand

__label__1 Great app, just tap or click and there it is, an east way to pay with and access your Discover card. If you have a smart phone, get this app and leave your card at home.
__label__1 This app. is perfect for all your mobile banking needs. I never go on their website, i just monitor and make all payments and transfers through this app.
__label__1 I have been using Discover for several years and there has never been a problem.  I would certainly recommend Discover
__label__1 Makes it easier to review my discover card transactions. I use it on my IPhone too. Makes it really easy to track things.
__label__1 This app works very well on my Kindle. There aren't any glitches and it works really quickly. It shows my accurate statements.
__label__1 Have never had any problems with the app on my phone and it appears to work just as well on the kindle.
__label__1 If you have a credit card it is a must to have. you can do everything with this app. do
__label__1 This app provides you with balances, all transactions and more. And to top it off, it was free. 5 stars!
__label__1 I really found it somewhat inconvenient to pop open my laptop to check on my accounts, but with this app I was able to register my Kindle as a trusted device that I frequently use, instead constantly answering security questions when accessing my account
__label__1 It's great when you can get all of the information you need at one place. I recommend getting it if you have a card.
__label__1 Not much to say unless you are a discover card holder.  Its very easy to use and navigate your account.
__label__1 If you have a Discover card, this app allows you to do all of the essential things you need and want to do on their website. The UI is simple and straightforward.
__label__1 This app is great for accessing your discover account from your kindle.  It is everything you need in an app.  I have no complaints and would recommend it to anyone who has discover.
__label__1 this helps me keep track with all my spending and how i need to spend my money because i can check my account anytime online. i love it.
__label__1 Good app. Great for checking balances and making payments. Its free and convenient. Go ahead and download it. Its free.
__label__1 This app is a dream come true!Pros:1) Let's you make payments2) Shows you the statement Balances3) Let's you sign up for Cashback bonus offers4) Let's you redeem your bonus balance5) Let's you search through transactions, view account activity, past stat
__label__1 Convenient to use and easy to install.  This app makes checking my Discover balance and transactions extremely simple.  I would highly recommend this app.
__label__1 Already familiar with this website-based app for desktop computer use, I find most of the same features and usefulness in the Android mobile app version.
__label__1 With life on the go, it's nice to be able to check your balance and see if payments have posted to your account.
__label__1 Easy to use and great layout. Perfect app for what I want to do from a mobile device, which is to view account balances and make an occasional payment. Use on Kindle Fire and HTC Evo.
__label__1 great app. shows balance, transaction, and interest without errors on any of my devices. highly recommend for use by all A++
__label__0 Since this app did not work on my Kindle Fire HDX tablet it's easy and quick to rate a one star rating. The idea is very good, but I will have to continue using my bookmark to access Discover. I certainly would rate the app higher if it did function as i

__label__1 I really like the feedly app. I wish I could give it 4-1/2 stars just because it is quite slow to load on my Android phone initially. I am not sure, though, if that might be an internet connection problem, so I figure 5 stars is probably the more fair wa

__label__1 I've constantly wished for a better way to manage all the news sites and blogs I follow while on my first gen kindle fire. I found feedly to be an awesome answer to my needs. I can browse daily feeds by subject or all at once. Adding new feeds is simple

__label__1 excellent news aggregator. This is a really wonderful app.EQUALLY AS good.as Feed Demon used to be for the PC. For those who love the news, get this app.
__label__1 Feedly is a great app that can find and organize a great deal of source materials into a slick format. I love how easy it is to brouse through news and blog entries on all of my favorite subjects on feedly.
__label__1 Feedly has changed my life! Without it, I may have been the last to hear about the SOPA Act, PIPA Act, ACTA Act, or Steve Jobs passing away. All of my mobile device have this app loaded. Smooth scrolling and the layout is elagant.
__label__1 I've used many apps, including the integrated Chrome and IE readers. So many that perform so little.The singular task every other RSS app does is poll a list of feeds you have judicially selected.The reason for reading a feed is to have a succinct overvi
__label__0 I was proactive and migrated all of my google reader feeds to feedly way before google reader was slated to go down, and all was fine. All my feeds were there, I liked the feedly format, it was great. Then I logged in after google reader was shut off. AL
__label__1 I switched to Feedly when I learned that Google Reader was going away. This is an excellent replacement. I really liked the Google app and Freely took a bit of getting used to but for a free app I am impressed.
__label__1 This app has been delivering my daily reading material for a year now. It is simple, intuitive and beautiful.I recommend this to any Internet reader.
__label__1 I really enjoy having so much information at hand. I still don't really understand all that I can do with the app but I enjoy what Ican do.
__label__1 I love Feedly, it delivers all the information and updates I want from all my favorite sites. I like how fast and simple it is.
__label__1 I have been using Feedly for about 3 months now since the Google reader shut down. So far I like it better and have recommended it to several others. I'm very happy with this app!
__label__1 I've been trying to find a good way to keep up with my favorite websites, blogs and webcomics and this is it. It even organizes them across all my devices! I love this thing.
__label__1 This application is perfect for catching up with whatever RSS news feed you have. This is the perfect replacement to the stock Google Reader applies application.
__label__1 After some research of various news feeders I tested Feedly. After getting use to its format I soon learned to customize and add content to it. Transferring my subscriptions from my Google reader was painless and complete. I enjoy this Kindle version bec
__label__1 Feedly is a good app and I love how easy I can add pages or blobs I want to follow. would recommend using it.
__label__1 I came to Feedly via the Google Reader shutdown. I have been quite pleased with the result. I think I spend less time keeping up with my RSS reading than I used to, without missing anything. Feedly 's interface is easy to navigate on all platforms I use.
__label__1 I got the Feedly app to replace Google Reader and have been very impressed. It's easy to set up favorite categories,  mark entire sections as read, save favorites, and share reads via social media. Feedly is now my must read every day.
__label__1 I was despondent when Google Reader was retired.  Fortunately, I found Feedly.  The developers are constantly working to improve the app and are super responsive to the user comminuty.  I love this app.
__label__1 Awesome news reader works great on the Kindle Fireit's little like the Pulse reader.Also supports video's and lot's more.
__label__1 I have been using Feedly for some time, and I've been very pleased with it. Even though Google reader is going away, I won't even notice it's gone.
__label__1 I like to use my Kindle to catch up on my fav websites and this app is by far the best one I've tried.
__label__1 Still giving it a full run throught, but in my search to replace Google Reader this is what I came to.So far its pretty nice and easy to use.
__label__1 Kids complain too much!. New to readers?. This reader has &quot;a huge list of RS news feeds from around the world&quot;, it's formated to look great on Kindle Fire, has dark and light themes, and pleanty of options to customize to your very needs, and V
__label__1 I like so much this app because I can organize my blogs. The design is so good and I feel confortable using it. I did not knew this app because I was using google reader the I think I will use this app for long time.
__label__1 I had never used an RSS feed app before, but with all the news about Google Reader I went on a hunt for one. Feedly had good reviews so I tried it out. I love it! I can even add my own blog to share it easily in person. :)
__label__1 I've been playing with this app for some time on my tablet.  I like the magazine format fine. However on my tablet I kept getting lost going to the next page....accidentally closing the app or ending up in a different section than the one you were readin

__label__1 So, I decided since Google decided to forgo their reader, I was going to just stop reading blogs. And, I did for a few months. But, I realized, I miss reading. I miss getting idea's for things to try in my home. Sure, there is Pinterest, and there is Fac
__label__1 Best way available to view google reader feeds now that reader itself is closing up shop. Magazine style and comfortable menus make for a very pleasing experience
__label__1 With the downfall of Google Reader Feedly really has taken up the thrown as an RSS aggregator. It's only continued to improve as the devs put more work into it.
__label__1 Feedly has become the go-to app for organizing RSS feeds since Google Reader took a dirt nap. Feedly is easy to organize, easy to look at and is great at saving stories for later. Give it a try while there's still a free version.
__label__1 I love my Kindle Fire for reading, and Feedly makes it even better. I can find many sources,and Feedly's magazine format makes it enjoyable to scan articles.
__label__1 I really cannot imagine a better way to stay current on what for me is a wide range of idiosyncratic topics. Using it on Kindle Fire Hd without any glitches.
__label__1 I had just started using Google's reader when i read an article (irony intended) that the reader was being phased out. With it came a recommendation for feedly (along with others). I was able to easily synch the 2 and then began using feedly exclusively.
__label__0 So many people raved about this that I just needed to check it out for myself. Everything is so superficial, it's like headline new lite. I don't want pages and pages of articles, but one or two sentences per topic seems a little silly. Maybe I'm not usi
__label__1 Good Bye Google Reader, I am so much happier with Feedly. I do not miss Google Reader, thanks to Feedly and DevHD.
__label__1 Since the loss of Google Reader I was at a loss and a gathering point for my news feed. The was a little battle of readers for a while but I'm glad I found feedly the interface is almost identical on all of my devices; iPhone 5, kindle fire, iMac and Mac
__label__1 My only complaint isn't really a complaint. I wish I could open more than one post at a time. Otherwise it's a near perfect app.
__label__1 Freely is absolutely the easiest way to access the many differing blogs I follow.  On my kindle, access is simple and fast.  I can organize the blogs by subject to maintain coherency.
__label__1 I had previously used Google reader and this is similar. It's easy to find blogs you want to follow in the search bar and add them to different categories. You can change the settings to customize it to your liking. The app itself is very professional lo
__label__1 I was upset after Google shut down Reader. I had read some good reviews on Feedly but saw some negatives saying it didn't sync with Feedly Cloud on the Fire version. I guess that was in the past because it works great now. I love that it syncs to my phon
__label__1 RSS feeds changed the way I used the internet 5-6 years ago and gave me a lot of my time back.  I am a Kindle loyalist and was looking for a good RSS reader.  I found Feedly and couldn't be happier.  It is perfect and does wverything I need it, too.  I c
__label__0 I used to use Feedly before Google acquired it but now in order to use the app it mandates signing in with a Google account.  I don't want to use Google and I can't save feeds I want to read locally on my phone so this is a useless app.
__label__1 Unless 1 of 2 things are true:youve paid for something else or have an irrational nostagic attachment to another podcast collector.  Great app, aggregates my podcasts in a coherent manner, and cut over from google reader was effortless.
__label__1 I love it...This is a great app for a person that likes to keep up with the latest news..Download it on kindle fire it works smooth
__label__1 Really love this app. It makes it really easy to see all the blogs I like to follow without having to go to my email and check them individually. I can quickly scroll through and see what I want to read more of or what I don't.
__label__1 If you used Google reader and were sad to see it go than this app is the answer for you.
__label__1 At the risk of sounding too dorky, this app is an essential for me. It only shows me links that I point it to and NO ADS. There is really nothing left to say, absolutely no down sides. I love it.
__label__1 I love that i can skim headlines and a blurb from various stories from various news sources all in one place. It also lets me know which are read or unread. Very convenient love it!
__label__1 Feedly has become the most-used app on my Kindle Fire. Nice, clean, modern interface for perusing news feeds. Love the swipe-based controls. Very nicely done.
__label__1 I really like Feedly as a replacement for Reader.  It is easy to sort through all my craft blogs and orgsnize then.  I like the thumbnail style main page also.
__label__1 I think the feedly app is far superior to the UI of the web version. I LOVE the swipe method of marking things as read or unread. This makes it so easy to follow all my newsfeeds.
__label__1 This reader is SO much better than Google's - Try it - you won't ever look for another RSS reader again.
__label__1 Just glad you were here when Google decided to split.. I have used this before Google disappeared and enjoy the layout. Works well on my Kindle Fire HD.
__label__1 I was sad to learn Google was ending Reader. I did what several million other Reader users did and easily transferred my subscriptions to Feedly. So far I'm satisfied with the switch.
__label__1 I had Feedly before. Didn't like it, so I removed it from my Kindle. But after repeated difficulties seeing Blogs I Follow on my Blogger dashboard, I decided to give Feedly another shot. I'm so glad I did.
__label__1 A real nice reader that is available on a wide variety of device s. Very fast and easy-to-use.  Works quite well on the kindle no glitches. Built in browser works excellent and is easy and intuitive to use.
__label__1 Ever since Google reader was shut down I have looked for a substitute for it. After trying many Feed Readers, I have settled on this as my replacement.
__label__0 This app is always crashing on a Kindle Fire HDX 8.9. It's it the Kindle? Is it the app? I don't know, but considering how frequently it happens, I'm inclined to believe the latter. As it is, it's almost unusable.
__label__1 I was not familiar with RSS feeds until today. That's that little orange logo that looks like a wi-fi symbol that you see on just about every web page thats important to you. Feedly is beautiful and user friendly. Displays nice windows that slide up/down
__label__1 Better than Google Reader. It's able to present news in a much better format. Feedly also organizes the articles better.
__label__0 Cannot log into Google account from the latest Kindle Fire. Waste of time downloading this app. Disappointing to say the least.
__label__1 Works in Chrome, Android, and Kindle. Feedly will replace the syncing back end when Google kills Reader in a few months. +1
__label__1 This feed reader is very fast and has a clean appearence.It looks like your running Windows 8.  It is very easy to customize and gives you the option to tweet, post on Facebook, or email an article.  You can even set up an email list.  After reading an a
__label__1 I have been using this service ever since google reader was retired. It took a little while, but I have gotten used to the interface and other unique features. This is definitely the best app/website combo I have seen for reading res feeds.
__label__1 Works well, stable and fast. Easy to use. The only complaint is it will not let me paste an address in the add content area to add a feed like I can in a web browser.
__label__1 I've tried all the major players - Google reader, pulse, netvibes, pageflakes, taptu, easy rss, etc.  In my opinion, Feedly is by far the best news aggregator. It's also one of the only ones that works on your phone, tablet, AND the desktop.
__label__1 There are a number of blogs I like to check on regularly, but since I am often doing so from my Fire or my Smart Phone, rather than my desktop, it is great to have the Feedly app available in all three places so that I can check in whenever I have a few 
__label__1 Organization is great.Easy to add blogs to your feed.Keeps all recent posts upfront.No issues linking to the actual site.Great replacement for Google Reader.
__label__1 I switched to feedly from Google reader because it was being discontinued. Best thing to happen! I love feedly, and this app allows me to check a all of the blogs I follow easily on my Kindle Fire.
__label__1 This app works and looks amazing on the HP Touchpad.  Looks perfect and utilizes the HD screen of a HP Touchpad.  Great Job.  All my Google Reader content in a beautiful layout.  Also plays video and podcast within the app.
__label__1 Only what I want, not what someone else thinks I want.I dumped newshog after they added annoying ads, and so glad, feedly is superior.
__label__1 A recommended replacement for Google Reader. It has always worked perfectly for me on my Kindle Fire. Easy to organize, so if you are organized, you can find what you're looking for with not much effort.
__label__1 I love Feedly. It's the first thing I open on my Kindle to catch all the current headlines and decide which ones I want to go deeper into!
__label__1 Have used this  before and I love it . They made my transition from Google easy and seamless, loads up and opens so you can enjoy. Thanks bill
__label__1 I've been a loyal user of Google Reader until it was retired. And soon after, I've become so used to Feedly that it has become my new RSS reader.
__label__1 Had to get a replacement for google reader because good had the nerve to close reader down. I moved over to feedly and it made the loss much less painful. the only suggestion is I miss searching through just my feeds
__label__1 I found this as a suggestion to replace Google Reader, and I wish I knew aboit it sooner. It is a fantastic RSS Reader with great features and enough flash to it to make it look slick without overdoing it. I like that it syncs accross all devices so when
__label__0 I never got to see what it was about. I tried to dl the app but a message came back as corrupt.if they fix the problem I'll be happy to try downloading again.
__label__0 This app sucks. It is very inaccurate, and it only tests you on recognizing patterns. I wasn't expecting much, but this was worse than expected.
__label__1 I have no idea how it really compares to other IQ Tests of any kind. I took my test at 11:30pm on my new Kindle Fire HD and surprised myself.  May take it again when I am bright eyed and more awake.  Really read or review each test item.  Think beforeyou
__label__0 This did not test intelligence.  It is basically a math test for spatial problems.  A true IQ test tests for all ranges of knowledge.  Glad I didn't have to pay for this one.
__label__1 I took the test and I was not happy with my score so I tried again and I came up!  So I wanted to test my family and one by one we all score about the same. Until my son with adhd played, he scored higher than us all. Well can you imagine what that did f
__label__0 It doesn't even have a valid way of testing your knowledge. It only tests on math and language arts, not even science. It is mostly questions such at &quot;what comes next in the pattern.&quot; If you aren't good with those like me, it will grade you ver
__label__0 Can not zoom, hard to read, too small letters and graphics on the 7&#34; fire. I do not know if they are more readable on larger tablets, but it was not fun with the 7&#34; fire.Dump it.
__label__1 Especially since I am exhausted and haven't been using my analytical thinking skills lately.  It's a lower score than I got the last time I took an official IQ test, but that was many years ago. The questions are what I would have expected, and I don't s
__label__0 I thought that this would be a mindless test, like a stupidity test but it actually requires a pen and paper to do some of the math problems I deleted it right away
__label__1 I am so relieved to find out that I have a mind and it is actually working!  Seriously, this is a fun way to find out if your brain is atrophied after being retired!
__label__1 Decent enough app that is exactly what it says it is, an iq test. I can't speak for how accurate it is but I had no problems at all downloading or using it on a 2nd gen kindle fire. My main reason for writing this review was to try to (at least to a smal
__label__1 this is amazing. it tests my IQ and I'm going to meed that. any way this is great for all ages. from 4 or 5 and up untill it dies. well you know what I mean. this is a smart app and should be more that free. its so good I think teachers could use it to t
__label__1 Great tool to sit back and keep your mind connected with hands and eyes. This is one of my favorites.
__label__0 who ever is the twisted foul mouthed sicko who made this!!! I have one sentence for u: how do u even call this funny!?!?!? is this how u get your sick kicks!?!?!? omg get a life dude!?!? DO NOT GET!!!!!!
__label__0 this app talks about sexual stuff and o gave it to my son and he asked me what is s3x? so this app Is so inoproprite not for children under 16
__label__0 hellooooo i havent even got this yet but i usally look at reviews before i get them and who ever made this game is sick and gross and this is NOT aceptable. i voted this app a one star because u cant vote no stars. bad. very bad. super bad.
__label__0 Both truths and dares are for people at least age eighteen. This is not a family game, and the questions are actually related to things that can be offensive as well. Questions are repetitive.
__label__0 I downloaded this app thinking it would be really fun to play with my family. but when we started playing, it had inappropriate questions. so we went and changed the questions, and we played. but when we went and played it again, it went back to the inap
__label__0 Thought this game would be fun to do with the grandchildren...NOPE...is an ADULT game.  I am still trying to get it deleted. Even as an adult...I found it offensive.
__label__0 I don't think you would want to buy thisvapp cause it ks crap so don't buy it if you want to wear a thing's!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
__label__0 worst game in the world and the dares are the worst just like the truths! this app stinks! DO NOT GET THIS STUPID APP!
__label__0 I'm 11 and its not approate for me and my friends there are some nasty words in it dont get it if u r my age.
__label__0 What the heck, its truth or dare, its supposed to be funny!!! Talking about this crap is stupid. Not many answers either, only like 5 or 6..... very disappointed!!!
__label__0 I hate it haves bad words and I'm 10 didn't get it. it has one thing it says to have sex with a player.
__label__1 This is a lot of fun. It comes with preset truths and dares. You can also add truths and dares. You get to pick truth or dare. Its a lot of fun when you have a group of people.
__label__0 So my friend came over and she said hi. Anyhow I was looking 4 a truth if dare app. Then I found this piece of bS it was full of dirty stuff like beer and sex. This game is some  serious cheddar. DO NOT GET! NOT WORTHY IF ONE STAR! EWWW!And my friend als
__label__0 this is really innapropriate for children! All I had to do was look at the 3rd picture and it has some extremly bad and hurtful things! DO NOT GET THIS APP! I repeat DO NOT GET THIS APP!!!!
__label__0 This game is horrible and innapropriate. It is absolutely the worst and I hate it. No one shouldnhave to go up to someone and say " what does this mean?" To play a game of truth or dare. So how about this. Truth or dare. Truth. This game is messed up. Tr
__label__0 this is the most non kid app everI cant believe this app I was lookingfor a app I could play at a sleep over with some of myfriends and I'm 16 this is still bad for my agepeoples pleas make some good Truth OR Dare APPS
__label__0 I bought this game on my kindel fire I'm 8 I bought it thinking it would be fun well it's. not I showed it to my 5year old sister guess what she asked me what sex means. some of the questions are drink a beer remove all clothing and make a toilet paper s
__label__0 i do not reccomend this app it is not for kids one of my dares was &quot;chug a beer&quot; so dont get this app unless your 21or older
__label__0 this truth or dare game sucks!! it is NOT for kids under 18 and it repeats the same thing over and over and over again!!!
__label__0 this is a horrible game all bad.IF YOU ARE A KID DONT GET THIS. BAD GAME. I wanted to play truth or dare.
__label__0 Tuck! Don't get this game unless you want to be very grossed out. Like this one time I picked truth it said do you where a thong? I hate this game.
__label__0 please don't get this app if you have kids that will play with your phone!!! look at the questions and you will see what I am talking about! The one near the bottom is the question that turned me off about getting this app. this is nasty!
__label__0 i started to play with my friends not knowing it was a terrible and sick app then we started it and it freaked and grossed us all out DO NOT GET THIS APP!!!!!!! I REPEAT DO NOT GET IT!!!!!
__label__0 this app sucks don't get it!!!!! you wont do what the dares are and wont say what the truths arw
__label__0 I'm ten year old. I thought this was a fun game for kids it isn't. don't get this app unless youare 18+. some of the things it said was do you wear a thong? where was the weirdest place you had sex? give someone a lap dance. this app is totally perverted
__label__0 I am a young woman.and I wanted a fun game to play with friends. Not something gross. This asks you all these privet inaproperate things. If your young and want a good Truth and Dare, skip THIS! Unliss you want to talk about girlfriend / boyfriend. stuff
__label__0 I was looking at this app.. I looked at the second picture and I knew my mom would've flopped.. badly .. omg I was grosser out! I would've been grounded for a User thts how bad this is..
__label__0 I got this game because I thought this one looked more like a truth or dare for KIDS... I should had looked at the reviews! this game is gross! not a game kids should play. think before you buy.........THINK!!!
__label__0 this app is very innapropriate and invasive! &quot;do you wear thongs&quot;? what's the wierdest place you have had s*x&quot;? have u ever had an orgasm? very innapropriate, and even if you delete all of them and put in ur own, its still not that great!!
__label__0 So weird. It has stuff like: Do you wear a thong?That's gross and discusting! I should not even rate his any stars. Please! Don't buy.
__label__1 Who would have guessed Kindle Fire has no option for cleaning your contact list easily!?! I thought I was going to have to clean my close to 1,000 entry contact list one item at a time. This was such a huge help to me. In just minutes my contact list was
__label__1 The Kindle contact manager is abysmal. Every other android device properly syncs with Google Contacts. At least the Kindle provides an import contacts capability to get minimal contact information but it duplicates contacts with prefixes (like Dr. or Pas
__label__1 Easy to use and did exactly what I needed,  Even though I may only need it once, I'm not getting rid of it because I might need it again someday.
__label__0 so this thin was a waste of time and download...uselessdeleted it soon as I saw how it works..meaning it doesnt work for people with google contacts.
__label__1 Not only does it deliver as promised but it has one of the best looking font faces on an app you'll ever visualize. To bad you'll only see it for a few seconds tops as the app does its thing in flick of a moment.  Instructions noting the exception where 
__label__1 This is a really nice game with a good bonus. The bonus round comes up pretty often. The first time i played this game, I got the bonus round over 10 times and my balance was over $900,000. If only it was real money. I wish!!!
__label__1 the buck is well worth it easy to use graphics are ok. this is the one and only slot machine app i use regularly pokie magic definitely struck gold on this app i repeat get this app you will love it
__label__1 Love this slot game.  Fun to play, have had no problems with it on my kindle fire. Like the two types of bonus rounds.
__label__1 Game and graphics are really nice on my Kindle Fire. Again, if you like slot games you won't be sorry if you get this one. The payout is good so it makes the game fun.
__label__1 I love this game.  It is one of my favorites.  I have recommended it to several of my friend .  They like it.
__label__1 Good game.  Graphics are beautiful and it's fun to play.  Easy to get lots of points.  Always mute the sound so don't know how that is.
__label__1 Great game. Best part is they do not rip you off having to actually buy coins.  No problems at all on my kindle.
__label__1 Really like the Pokie Magic games. It's a lot of fun. This game is very colorful and changes when things could get boring.
__label__1 Love it!  Love it!  Love it!  My family and I play is whenever we can.  Everything about this game is fun, and it was free!  I would recommend it to anyone who likes slot machines. The sounds, music and visuals are great.  Glad I went for it.
__label__1 This game is really cool and the fire breathing dragon is pretty awesome and the payouts are the BEST and I like the bonus games
__label__1 Downloaded to my Fire Kindle and worth the $0.99 cents. Played other Slots but this one is the best. Sounds &amp; Graphics are good.
__label__1 In real casinos, one of my favorite slot machines is the Fire Dragon.  This game put out by Pokie Magic simulates the real thing!  I have fun playing it at night in bed, always trying to get the bonus before I turn off the light.  Knowing that I've made 
__label__1 PROS:  Well worth the 99 cents for the hours of fun it has given me.  There are no pop-up ads asking you to buy something else, like there are in most of the free games, that alone makes it worth the 99 cents.  It pays out very frequently.  In the game o
__label__1 I have been playing this game for a long time now and I enjoy it.  It is always fun to play and see what will happen. I started playing this game on my I-touch  and I now have it on my kindle .
__label__1 This cracked screen prank is pretty realistic. It has a lot of choices for what kind of crack you want, and the size of the crack. It's easy to use, and you can even use other apps while the crack is still on the screen. Very satisfying, good job!
__label__1 i loved it because it totally scared my sister cuz she actually thought i broke it lol :) u should get it also
__label__1 I love this app the first week I got my kindle fire I did this app and my dad flipped out I mean he was going nuts untill I should him wat it realy was it was halerious
__label__0 froze my kindle fire and couldn't exit. most Likly it has a bug that will freeze/ruin your phone never get it!
__label__1 I fooled my friends with the crystal leak some have to high of graphics so they don't look good but this is an amazing app.
__label__1 I like this app. 9/9 modes totally creeped out my mom.The cracks look real and you can control the size and stuff.
__label__1 This prank works better than I actually expected it to. I try to remember to set it whenever someone asks to borrow my phone or if I have to show someone something on it. The look on their face is priceless!
__label__0 this game stinks it freezes and it really breaks. it doesn't even have good grafics don't get it its horrible
__label__1 I like ot its fun scared the heak out of my mom with it so if u like pranks get this app
__label__1 This app works as described. If you want a realistic looking &quot;broken&quot; phone, this is a good free app. Good for someone who always borrows your phone. What did you do to my phone!!! lol
__label__1 This app rocks and my dad freaked out when he saw my screen.This app is a must have.It is always on even when you turn off the app so it looks so real.Great for April Fools day!If you want a good prank get this app!
__label__0 I wouldn't never get this app. It's to big! If I were u I would get it on my phone it will look a lot better than on a kindle. Everyone is saying it's not cool I got it they are right. I am eight and I no what I am talking about. :-}
__label__0 warning.watching this will haunt you for life.do not buy u will wish u didn't.I do so if u buy u will be like this :O wtf is this but if u don't buy u will be like : ) I'm glad I didnt
__label__1 I heart it so much I was like wtf is this and are u telling me Santa not real what the duck is this
__label__0 The kindle fire doesen't even have a cameravery gross somtimespiece of garbagea 3 year old made thisI'm never buying games form Lycette Bros againBTW who in the world would love this game I mean seriously?
__label__0 I hate this game it's HORRIBLE it's not what I expected it's just gross!no one get this game it just wastes your time!
__label__0 this would totally be a zero if it could be one. l mean really who would pay for the full version of this please don't install this. But if u do you'll probably end up deleting it anyway.
__label__0 I cant even use this on my kindlefire! Its too big to do and you get bored of it in 3 seconds. In fact, you dont even like it
__label__0 don't get this app. weird mouths that uses its tounge  to much. freky. don't get this app at all I mean it. I would give it a 0 if I could.
__label__0 You might as well just fork over .99&cent; for the full version because it's not good. Even the full version sucks. There are honestly many many more of the mouth apps that you can get and they have hundreds of face to use. PLUS this one only has a few. 
__label__0 I would give this app 0 stars if I could but apparently that is not an option.  so if you read this don't waste your time with this app.
__label__0 there is an app for iPod touches and smartphones called juicy fruit sweet talk and it shows similar things. but the mouths say funny things instead of blowing raspberries. this stinks for kindle fire. its cheesy and looks like a bunch of teens made it up
__label__0 This app is a waste of space. It sucks. &gt;_&lt; If you try to get this it is a waste of space.
__label__0 sucks on a kindle fire because the kindle is huge and it'll look funny ( but not 4 u ) it really sucks
__label__1 best thing ever it has lips mouths I like ducks well. your ordinary bun and thyes. you need buns and thyes to live if you don't have this app too bad just downlaod it don't listen to those crazy peeps who say this awesome thing is disturbing really its n
__label__0 This app SUCKS. I wouldn't recommend it for anyone. I deleted it the first time I tried it! I hate it go away from it.
__label__0 this is just plain sick!!!!! why would would any one want to pay for the full version. this is bad enough and its free!
__label__0 This app is very lame and it i  not fun. There is really no choices of which mouth you want to choose and they are really boring. Please listen to me and don't ever get this game!
__label__0 I looked at the app and hey pretty funny right? I was wrong. I opened it and omg it was freakish. it gave me the hibba bajibas!!!! aka the chills.... scary!!!!
__label__1 it is amazing those ideats are stupid. just listen it also co.es free faces just try it plz if you get your a very nice person. to be nice to the company

__label__0 this app is terrible! it just a bunch of videos of other peoples mouths, nasty! just a waste of time and space!
__label__1 First let me say that I normally do not play games like this...I play games like words with friends and such...having said that...since the first day I downloaded this app on my kindle fire I have been addicted....the ways you can design are almost unlim
__label__0 this app is completely stupid. I don't mean to b rude, but that's the truth.  it gives you no directions on how to do anything, and you have to pay SSSOOOOOOOO MUCH for everything not even including real money. for example, you have to pay 10 gems just t
__label__1 I love this app it is awesome. it is free and super fun. u can get lots of animals and crops and isn't hard at all!!!  its like a real farm!!!!!!  ::-)))))))  &lt;3.
__label__0 these apps are horrible and a rip off! you have to pay for everything and they have been raising prices! do not get this app.
__label__1 Downloaded this app and I love it! Convinced all my friends to add it too. So easy to add all my Storm8 friends!
__label__1 I love this app because first I'm nineteen and I got it for my little sister but find myself playing it to sometimes my little sis takes away my kindle at 10 at night or in the mornings to play farm story shaloves it
__label__0 Team Lava. And Farm Story are ONLY about MONEY. You can't buy with out jewels and it take money for jewels. THEN jewels are TAKEN back, or disappear without your knowledge, and then Team Lava will not replace.
__label__1 best app ever i love it its soo much its soo adictive in a good way. you should sooo get this app.
__label__1 My granddaughter wanted this and loves it. She loves choosing the products to plant and then when ready picking them.
__label__1 this game passes time away and is very addictive. it is way better than farmville. I would recommend. it to any who has a lot of time on their hands.
__label__1 I absolutely love this!  Move on over farmville.  I love this game because I have problems loading farmville on m computer.  Farm story is very similar but so much easier and runs smoother.  AWESOME GAME!
__label__1 it's additive! reminds me of mafia wars from myspace. I play all day if I could trying to get gems do I can buy more stuff
__label__1 It's easy and so addicting.  Great free app.  Definitely recommend for all ages.  No problems ever.  It's fun talking with other farmers all over the world.
__label__1 This is great for kids young and old :-) but I think the little ones it is great to let them play it .I tried it and it is fun. The little ones will love it .
__label__0 1st most of the stuff cost gems which u need 2 buy with real money.2nd its super boring,no goals,no nothing.What ever u do don't get this game!
__label__1 Great game! It works great on my Kindle Fire. It is a a lot of fun. It is my favorite game that I have.
__label__0 I tried it cause I like Hay Day app for iPhone.  Nothing like it!  This app sucks big time!  Don't recommend.
__label__0 i like the game but suddenly it force closes all the time.  it was fun for until it started to do that. please fix!
__label__0 There is a rare moment in farm story without having to use gems. Almost everything that you can buy costs you gems, and the 10 they give you to start can't buy a tomato, even. (I'm being literal). In fashion story and farm story, the average fir gems you
__label__0 I tried this game and found it too juvenile for my tastes.  I deleted it after about 10 minutes.  This would be a great kid game on a long trip.
__label__1 This game is awesome I don't know why people complain about spending real money. I don't, and my farm is just fine so when u play this game my storm id is: fablehaven87
__label__1 I really like this farm game it keeps you interested and you can meet others farms and neighbors and you can have trees, animals and crops to make money to get more of what you want.
__label__1 Love playing this game, fun to watch the crops grow. You get to visit other players farm and help  Water the crops.
__label__1 So fun. I highly recommend it to you. I played it for at least a half hour straight. I don't have much money, but I'm planning to buy a tool shed for a house. It's the cheapest.  Wow. I could spend all this time telling you HOW fun it is.
__label__1 this is a very fun game and it is even better because I have a kindle fire very very good game
__label__1 I love this app. It works great on the Kindle Fire, and addictive. I am 11 and have not slipped up on accidently buying any gems. It does ask to buy gems, just hit cancel, and brush past it. Add me Pitbullocer.  :)
__label__1 awesome. game . I need some nieghbors.I play everyday. You can add me. Name is anoldog.I love playing this game. I play it everyday.Just starting though and need neighbors. You can add meanoldog.
__label__1 This game is great. If you are careful and read what all the pop-ups say you won't spend any money on accident.
__label__1 I love being able to farm on my Android. I loved Farmville on Facebook and I wanted a farming game that didn't require a login.
__label__1 This is super cool. THE BEST GAME EVA!!! I can't believe they made such an awesome game. Over well worth the price. But people, don't raise the price! Peeps need to see how awesome this is.
__label__0 It's an alright game. The annoying thing is that there are no notifications for this, so you either have to time how long it will take your crops to harvest for find some other work around, which is a huge inconvenience because I don't want all these ext
__label__1 I love how I can pick out my own crops to grow. plus all the stuff I can get. I wish there was an farm story 2.  so I can build an even better farm.
__label__1 UPDATE: 2/27/12  Now that I've played the game for about a month I thought it deserved all five stars.  You can actually have a decent farm without having to pay real money for the gems.  Just takes a lot of planting and harvesting.  The game is a lot of
__label__1 Absolutely addicted. There are lots of cool items almost weekly. Get to meet many great people  from  all over. On it almost  everyday!!.
__label__1 This is my favorite game out of the team lava games for the kindle fire.works really well and is not a boring game. u don't have to buy anything with real money unless you want to.... rate &#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;stars....

__label__1 this is the best game I have ever down loaded I promise I have played this for like one year and will never get tired
__label__1 Awesome app and when you get it add amyacdc to your neighboors. And loo for a awesome girl called Kayla!
__label__1 This game is adictive. but after a while It gets boring then fun then boring then fun. so this game is awesome
__label__1 I love this game. Everybody is so nice to me on here no one is mean to me. This is the best game ever. Dont get Fashion Story ever THERE R BULLIES ON THERE. GET THIS GAME!!!!!
__label__0 each story game has its own little problems but farm story is the most boring. first off it takes forever to earn money and even then you earn a profit of about 100 coins so it takes so long to move on in the game. I simply couldn't get into it because i
__label__1 love it the animals are really cute and the trees get you lots of coins. I have all except nightclub story
__label__1 Heeyy waz uuppp its me again now listen up I have got something to say I LOVE THIS GAME!!!! U know I wish  you could like crossbreed plants that would be sooooooo cool!!!! like a pinelily you know a lily and a pineapple. I am such a thinker;) so all toge

__label__1 Both myself and my 5 year old granddaughter have fun with this! Itis a great learning tool for h e r!!!!!
__label__1 I love farm story. its a fun game where you have your own farm, neighbors to water, and a wall where everyone can post comments on.
__label__1 this app is fun but if you wait too long to pick up your crops it withered and then you have to plant them all over again
__label__1 It works great on my Kindle Fire, but you have to have a Internet access which I don't see why?? Other than that, this app is extremely awesome.
__label__1 This game is great! Not only do my sons love it, but I find myself checking on the farm every day. It is comparable to the other story games by Team Lava. We have them all on our Kindle Fire and think they are all very fun.
__label__1 fun game that can really draw u in. kid safe, it is pretty much farmville except with out facebook!!!! I found it a little frusterating at all the items that costs a ton of gems ( which are really hard to get unless u are willing to pay real money for so
__label__1 This game really fun to play, especially when you don't have anything else to do. You can plant crops that can take anywhere from 1 minute to 3 days. This game has pretty good graphics and works really good on the kindle fire. I strongly recommend this g
__label__1 I do love this game already and haven't even had it a whole day. stayed up all night already playing it.

__label__1 I have been having lots of fun with this trying to build the farm.  Going slow right now, but I am gaining a few items as I go along.  Lots of fun.  Great app, try it.
__label__1 This is a very fun farming version like farmville! I love the animal sounds, the large choice of crops, trees, and decorations.

__label__1 awesome game!!! I enjoy makeing my own farms!!!!! great for the fire ;) play ever day!! fav game love it

__label__1 love this game I have fashion story and club story and this one add me on all if u have them chanel1000 but yeah this game is so fun and addictive I have a kindle fire and they work great on them and I don't buy the gems ( just saying)
__label__0 This app is terrible.  I am very disappointed.  You have to buy gems and is a very poor knockoff of Farmville!!
__label__1 This game rocks it is a awesome game who ever likes farming will love this game a lot. You can plant just almost anything.
__label__0 You can't do anything in this game unless you have gems. But at the beggining of the game. it forces you to spend all your gems. The only way to get gems is to buy them. 5gems cost. 10 dollars. If you don't spend real money. you can't progress or even pl
__label__1 Great time killer. No crop stealing just fun! \nMake new friends by getting neighbors. Water your neighbors crops and send them gifts. \n\n
__label__1 I love this game! Its very addictive and fun for anybody! But it requires patience and thinking, over all its a very cool game:) I recommend it!!!!
__label__1 Farm story runs very smooth on the kindle fire.  It gives you an option of having nieghbors or not.  great for younger players also.
__label__1 hello my name is BORING this game has no life LOL just kidding this app is great for kindle HD so buy it down load it whatever JUST GET IT but beware you might have to pay ppl some mola
__label__1 Like pretending to grow and harvest without having to really get dirty? Do you enjoy touring other people's gardens, doing them favors and getting presents in return? This game is totally addictive. Players grow crops but can also plant fruit and nut tre
__label__0 am i the only one getting force closed on kindle this morning? did I miss an update? will give more stars later.
__label__1 i wouldnt say i LOVE it but close. its a good game you can play your way...dont want to wait 16hrs for a plant? just plant Rasberries and Strawberries! with a 1min and 5min timer you dont have to wait all day to start earning money and experience!
__label__1 it is a realy cool game and you don't need to spend money on it the only problem that there is is that it can foreclose some times but you only have to restart your kindle
__label__1 so now I am addicted to all but one of the story games. lord help me if they make another one.
__label__1 I love pet shop story and city story and night club story.so I must love farm story.true true your.your right if you said I liked it.well what I'm trying to say is I really think you should get it.Hope you. like it - EVIL PUG GIRL
__label__1 slit of people are saying that to advance you have to buy gems but you don't. My friend is level 87 and he hasn't bought anything you just need coins to play , gems are for things that are extra. the game is really fun you make your own farm and can be s
__label__1 I LOVED this game!!!! Although the gems can cost money, coins are easy to earn and you can decorate your farm any way you want! Name your farmer, and plow your way through the game! You can also make a storm8 id-mine is champvisits- and make neighbors! c
__label__0 You start with a small field and must expand. your expansion also includes any decorations, animals or buildings, so things stay in this weird square shape. did not enjoy it
__label__1 I love this game it is berry easy to do and you don't have to pay for anything in the game.

__label__1 I love Farm Story, I don't however, love spending my hard earned money on things like broken tractor signs!  You all should be ashamed  charging 24 gems for garbage. I have been wanting the floating island that is beautiful, the tree hammock that's adora
__label__0 ive never been a fan of teamlava games for at least 2 reasons.1. ITS EXPENSIVE!!! you need to buy aton of things with real money which is real expensive.2. Its boring. I played this game for 3 days and it got seriously boring with the adds and they kept 
__label__1 farm story is a lot of fun.  love it. it is a great way to keep in touch with some of your friends who are also playing

__label__0 I didn't like this game one bit. I felt it was borrringg and thank gosh it was free cuz the reviews were so good I woulda bought it. leave it to me to have da only negative comment
__label__1 I love this game. Always have. You can plant flowers, fruit, vegetables, wheat, odd crops and trees. They have lots of decorations. But for some reason have not given new decorations since November 2013. They used to do this once a week. Please update te
__label__1 I have Farm Story on my kindle fire and it is amazing. Sure u can spend real $ but u don't have to because its really easy to earn coins and gems. All u have 2 do is plant crops and trees then master them
__label__1 I only wish our farm ran this efficiently! I like sitting in my recliner, raising crops etc. and only moving my finger!
__label__0 all you do is plant...... and wait for it to grow, nothing to build, nothing else to collect.... just boring
__label__1 I've been playing for 4 years now, it's a great way to meet interesting people From around the world. There's a wide variety of crops, flowers, trees to plant and many animals. You DON'T need to spend a dime on this AWESOME game.KEEP FARMING  ~:0)&trade;
__label__1 I play this game every day its a whole lot better than the game on facebook. u don't need to worry about energy or side quests to keep ur farm going. get the dog bowls and resell for big bucks.
__label__1 I love this game. You can use real money but you do not have to I don't. I still love all the stuff you can get without the gems. Also you can password protect your device so your kids cant spend your hard earned real money.

__label__0 Take a nice friendly game with positive activities and absolutely RUIN it with their gem traps designed to STEAL your inapp purchase content.  Why cant they let you spend the gems on things you want?  There are constant tricks everywhere to pick your poc
__label__1 Great game to pass some time with. Lots of options for different crops and decorations. Really like the social aspect of the game.
__label__1 It is fun. A cute little game that makes boredom go away. Its creators also made restaurant story; bakery story; and pet shop story.

__label__0 in order to get some of the advanced options , you would need to spend a bunch of real money (to buy gems), since you can't earn the gems.  If you are willing to spend the money, then you can create some cool looking farms, otherwise this game is pretty

__label__1 I don't write reviews unless I REALLY enjoy the item so this one is a keeper! You really don't need any real money to play if you're willing to be a good farmer &amp; have some patience. Set the in-app controls so you don't  lose anything by accident. My

__label__0 Kindle Fire - I didn't even play this game.  I noticed, after I downloaded it, that real money is used to advance in this game.  Unless you want to pay for a free app, stay away from this one.
__label__1 Hiking I think that farm story is the best app in the world. At first I had no clue what this game was and thought itwould be dumb but when I downloaded it it turned out to be awesomly awesome!!!!!! I give it... &#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733; FIVE S
__label__1 eThis game is so cool. The raspberrys are free to plant. I repeat they are free I tell you free.
__label__1 fun app great. and easy it takes long to download though but still fun oh ya JUST DONT BUY GEMS THEN
__label__0 This was one of my favorite games.. but team lava you have a one star and i will not buy gems until you remove tap to manage for ios users and let us delete &quot;Stormies farm&quot; or at least be honest about it.. I really enjoy this game but recent bu
__label__1 BEST APP EVERED PLAYED. I LOVE IT. WOSH THEY WILL MAKE ZOO SYORY. BUT IT STILL IS AWESOME. GET IT GET IT GET IT!!!!!!!
__label__1 I just love the great games Team Lava has for customers who love FREE games. I recommend this game to all of you have enjoyed their other games.
__label__1 Keeps ongoing. Crops grow you pick and I keep going. Trying to be self sefishent and spent ne real money
__label__1 DONT ADD ME but id is lizzy8989 all story games are awesome but this is the awsomest one tip: DONT BUY GEMS
__label__0 like many other games, your play is limited unless you actually pay for things. otherwise this app gets boring REALLY quick. try Zoo Club instead. much more fun, and you don't have to pay.
__label__1 Addicting! You find yourself very caught up in not only your farm but visiting &amp; obtaining &quot;neighbors&quot; as well. The only aspect that I'm not crazy about is the need to obtain &quot;gems&quot;. Which can cost real money!
__label__1 ...my farm is my "get-a-way"...i spend hours "on the farm" and "visiting" the neighbors...i really enjoy planning and designing the layout of my farm, earning the money to buy the improvements on my wishlist and visiting neighbors and the community to ad
__label__1 love this game. easy enuff for my grand daughter to play.but it does have a problem connecting at times and we lose our crops
__label__1 plz add me I'm new to the game and will water and tip daily my storm id is Bettyboop2 if you need a neighbor I'm here
__label__0 This game is pretty good, but it has a fatal flaw. A ton of kids are getting harassed on this game and getting bullied. Its like the movie Cyberbully. I deleted this game after the harassment became to much.
__label__1 very fun I'm having no problems!I tried to download it before but it didn't so I tried again and now it works!
__label__1 I love this game a lot!But now it says there is an updated version you can download only on the app storeI only have a kindle fire thats regular! Plz helllpppp meeeIm afraud my flint corn will wither if i dont collect my crops!
__label__0 I HATED this game! It was so pointless because you have to buy almost everything with gems. It was truly  stupid. :(
__label__1 I have this game...Restaurant Story & Bakery Story. All are so much fun to play! Many boo-hoo these games because they think u have to spend real money on gems to play, this is not true. You get 2 gems for each crop/tree you master! There are 4 levels to
__label__1 Kindle Fire User. I love the game. You do NOT need to buy anything. If you are concerned about auto purchases you have the option of requiring password confirmations for in-game purchases.
__label__1 I LOOVVEE this game!!! i recommend this game for everyone!!! I also recommend all the teamlava games too they are so much fun and its pretty much all I play!! by the way if you want to be my neighbor my id is teralikespickles in all of them!!!
__label__1 There is plenty of stuff you can get without gems. I don't know about this game because you can't download it on kindle fire. But city story is awesome sure all it is it tapping but isn't that all any game for a tablet or smart phone is?
__label__1 Great knowing that your kids know how hard a farmer works! In this game you get to grow crops and go to other people's farm like your neighbors and the community. I would advise playing this on the Kindle Fire or Tablet, so it would be clear.Hope this re
__label__1 listen people...you CAN buy them for real $$$ IF YOU WANT to...it don't force you to buy any thing...it will try BUT you may decline if you want to...at least give this app a freaken chance BEFORE you rate it 1little star just because of that...plez peop
__label__1 I absolutely LOVE this game, but I tried to play today &amp; it's telling me that the version is no longer available, to download an update. So go to the app store &amp; there isn't an update &amp; in the game when you click on the update message, it tak
__label__1 for someone like me who has only a few quiet moments in a day this is perfect. if you're patient you can advance every few days.  annoying how pricey the gems cost - it'd be 5* if they made them a better value.  I haven't bought any just on principle
__label__1 If you don't want to spend cash, go to menu, settings, in -app purchasing, and disable. Easy as pie :)
__label__1 I miss staying in the farm. It reminds me of my childhood. I love it really.. five stars for this.
__label__1 have played game on kindle fire and hd kindle works great only downfall can't do achievements to win awards,but it is a very fun and every changing game.
__label__1 I have always liked this game, I play it on my iphone and find it very enjoyable. More games like this are needed for the Kindle.
__label__1 I do enjoy farm story. I determine how much time I have to dedicate to playing so it doesn't control me, I am in charge,although it can be addicting, so farm at your own risk...Happy Farming!!!
__label__1 I really like this game because it has many different options and settings.  This game is a way for city people to experience farming. Farm Story is good for all ages!
__label__1 YOU NEED TO GET THIS APP. PLZZZ ZZZ ZZZZ ZZZZZ ZZZZZ. ZZZZ ZZZ ADD IMGODSGIRL! ! ! ! ! FUN FUN FUN FUN FUN
__label__0 this sucks...I cant even purchase the app because it asks tor a credit card from amazon account...its suppled to he free I don't get it at all...
__label__1 I love this game great for all ages. It does let you buy things with real money withing the game so I would lock it in parental controls if you have a young child. Otherwise this game is great.
__label__1 I totally love this gave. It is fun growing plants and veggies. I can make new friends and get to see how they make their land. I really like it alot
__label__1 THE BEST GAME EVER FOR  EVERYBODY IN THE FAMILY , THE KIDS AND OLDER PEOPLE ARE LEARNING  A LOT AND PLAYING .

__label__1 such a wonderful game if you need paint or something else I will give it to you I send gifts daily my ssid is shotgunbabby again
__label__1 team lava is the best. I have all there games and I like restaunt story and that is awesome how can this be eny diffrent.
__label__1 you can do any. thing you want but it is not free but it ia really fun you should try. it every day
__label__0 i played farmville for a very long time so when i seen this i decided to give it a go and that lasted a few days at the most..this game is very bad things are to expensive and the lay out is not good either..and it froze up alot
__label__1 It is a great game. what people don't understand is that you don't have to buy the gems, you can earn them. slow process earning gems, but still, you can EARN them.
__label__0 Games by TeamLava take exploitation to a ridiculous level! The ability to build funds and awards to purchase items is slow tedious and works in real time. A friend of mine bought this game for her granddaughter. After she played the game for a few hours,
__label__1 this is similar to farmville from facebook. this is fun, you don't have to play it all the time because most plants take over an hour to grow... similar apps by team lava include bakery story and restaurant story... fun and somewhat addictive...
__label__1 I L - O - V - E  IT it is fun and easy too. it is great for kids
__label__1 Pls add warcraftgirl.  Super fun game.  I play most of the teamlava story games.  This one in particular is one of my favorites.
__label__1 fun game.  it is very additive and I can not wait to check my crops.  needs to have crops and flowers with shorter timers.
__label__1 This is a fun little story game that kept me entertained.  I&apos;d love to see more levels.\n\nI like the details.
__label__0 Been playing since feb every day now i cant says no longer supported?? Here we go again with teamlava and amazon!!Where is the updated version for kindle? Come on teamlava we know it is your fault i will never play another TL game again it's ridiculous w
__label__1 Enjoyable and relaxing.  Runs well on kindle fire.  Don't need to purchase anything unless you want to grow quickly (farm size and content).  I enjoy taking my time planting crops and tending animals.  Nice graphics also.  Good job TeamLava.
__label__1 This game is really easy but watch out for your money! You can get at another level in seconds! There are only 2 crops that are free and millions of other crops to choose from. You can invite friends too by E-mail or Skype!!!
__label__1 I love this game!!!! Fun way to pass time. If I could change one thing about this game it would be to have more chances to gain gems instead of purchasing them.
__label__1 I love it. I asked my parents what to choose either this game or city story. Then my mom said only 1 game. Then she said download 1 and play it then you can download another
__label__1 Reminds me a lot of the way Farmville was at one time.  Very enjoyable and you can play it as often or as little as you like.  The only downside is trying to find neighbors to help out.  I've wound up having to visit the Farm Story page on Facebook where
__label__1 okay this is so much fun! I recommend you get it cause it's fun on a kindle fire and when ur bored it is fun to play! get it.....it is free!!!
__label__1 I really really love to play this game (: I'm just really hoping goals would be added to it like restaurant story of bakery story. I'm more of follow the goals type person. Other then I play this game pretty much like crazy
__label__1 i got this game on my iphone, then on my kindle fire. beutiful illistations! i fell in love with this game!  :) i don't have enough space or time to have a farm,  so i got this game. i told my friend about this game,  shes playing it 24/7! this is an esc
__label__1 I think this game is cute and fun.. it keeps you occupied when you have nothing else to do..very entertaining.
__label__1 I love taking care of my farm  with  all  my animals and garden too  I think  other people will love thisgame very much.
__label__0 this game is so stupid I trier to collect my plants but it wont let me I know this app is free but don't waste your time playing it
__label__0 I play 6 teamlava games and on about level 80 of 99 on all. I used to love them. don't know whats going on but its changed. teamlava abandoned. city story but kept selling &quot;city bucks&quot; to new players for weeks. yesterday they increased prices 1
__label__1 but this game is awesome. And I should know, I'm a player. This game is fun, interesting to most, creative, ADDICTING, and strategic. When I say addicting, I mean ADDICTING. This game has kept me up most nights tending to my crops and animals, earning co
__label__0 It wouldn't work for me.  I didn't get what to do.  There were no goals or anything. It was very confusing.  Not worth it
__label__1 I have enjoyed this game so much.  If I get tired of playing the regular game, I try the advanced for a while and I am glad to get back to the regular game. Lots of fun.
__label__1 I love all of the apps by this developer. I have pet shop story... bakery story... resteraunt story... night club story... and now farm story. I totally recomemd any of the story apps... and if you like this one you should try fantasy islands!
__label__1 I have spent so many hours playing this game! One of the best apps you can get! There is so much to do and it is a lot of fun!!!!!!!!:)
__label__1 I love this game! as of now I'm a level 35 and have over 200 neighbors. my id is jrpreds1. People say u HAVE to buy gems to play. YOU DONT its a great game and the people who say you do are just mad that they are too stupid to buy them and not reading th
__label__1 farm story is a fun low stress game. it does not make your heart race and that is just what I wanted. Instead you plant your garden and wait for things to grow. The variety of plants animals and buildings complete with fences and paving stones is amazing
__label__1 I'm an avid online gamer. Im usually a console only gamer but this little farm game has pulled me away from my 360 for a very unexpected reason, the online community. You work together with people you meet in the game to expand your garden. By watering r
__label__1 I love it! you can plant any crop you want and get all the animals you want! I highly reccomend it to anyone!! :) try it out;)
__label__1 I like choosing what I can grow and moving thing where I want them.  I enjoy visiting my neighbor's farms and seeing what they do.  the only downer is that I haven't found any way to earn jewels to get the cool stuff.  don't want to spend a lot of cash j
__label__1 Looking for hours of fun? This is the game for you. The best part is being neighbors with other farmer's from all over the world.
__label__1 It has amazing quality and fabulous graphics. It is a easy "learn how game "and is perfect for all ages
__label__1 The very beet game ever.  Love to raze your animals without. going out of your house.  I love it. you are going to love it too!!!!!!
__label__0 This app is..... unknown to the the world. From the other reviews on all the other team lava games, most of the reviews are bad. All about gems. I'm probably not going to buy this games it'll just end up like the other games I'm assuming.  Doesn't sound 
__label__1 Very addicting!! I can't get enough. Can play for hours. Wish I more coins though for the stuff I want.
__label__1 I love these kind of games.this is probably one of my favorite one in all of Amazons app store.I rate it five stars!!!!!!  :)
__label__1 You got to get this fun filled game! If you download this and rate this game five stars then you're my best friend EVER!!!  YOU WILL LOVE THIS GAME FOR SHORE! This game is the bomb and a great time killer.  You NEED to download this game. LOVE LOVE LOVE 
__label__0 Although this game is fun, its almost the same game as Farmville. The biggest difference is that Team Lava keeps raising the prices of everything! I don't mean that you have to buy gems or spend one cent of your real money! Team Lava just keeps raising t
__label__1 This game is so cool! I love all farming games, but I wish there was a lot more farming games. Love the animals. My kids likes to play this to. I download this game for them and I started playing and I love it. I play it more then my kids do.
__label__1 YOU PEOPLE NEED TO READ THE DESCRIPTION BEFORE YOU BUY IT! THIS IS WHY YOU ARE GETTING CHARGED FOR GIVING IT TO YOUR KIDS!
__label__1 relaxing game. if you're looking for a long term game to relax and slowly level it is greatset crops and watch them grow
__label__0 If any of u like this, than omg. What a stupid game!!! Horrible. Wish i could give it a big fat 0!!!!
__label__1 You don't need to buy gems! and if you accidentally hit it buy gems it still requires password! And you can earn gems by planting certen crops! I've changed my name for 10gems opened 2 mystery boxs each for 24 gems and I've bought an elephant for 52 gems
__label__0 I love TeamLava. This game sucked. Horrible, everything is way too much money. I got it, then removed it immediately.
__label__1 It's as close to Farmville, without having to be on facebook (which I really love about it the most.)  If you have children, you may want to turn off in app purchases.  It's been a lifesaver for me, because my niece's &amp; nephew's can't purchase withou
__label__1 This game is so much fun you nead this game. It is Awesome. You want this game you will not regret it.
__label__1 I love the idea of running my own farm without the work. this is a great way to pass time.
__label__0 this app always closes when I'm invite it always says force close so I have to force the app to close
__label__1 I love this app so so much best app ever invented I hope they will never ever remove this app from the kindle fire store
__label__1 I love this game! It gives me a great chance to chat with my friends over the weekends. Plus it's free!!! But you can only chat with your friends if they play the game too.

__label__1 I love this game and I live on a farm and this is like you own an farm in a game those I love ot
__label__1 Farm Story is a beautiful and well done app. This free game is a lot like Farmville. The gameplay is nice, and using the touchscreen can be very responsive. Then again, you kinda have to use the touchscreen. The game has good graphics and this game is no

__label__1 If I could rate 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 stars I honestly would . This creator has out done himself once again . How does he come up with this . Fun addicting and free. Only three words for a top app and he has succeed.
__label__0 I hate it! I barely played it for 40 sec. before I uninstalled it. all you do is tap stuff. I down loaded it on my kindle fire and hoped it would be a fun time passer, But it was so boring. They try to make you buy &quot;gems &quot; with real money. Such
